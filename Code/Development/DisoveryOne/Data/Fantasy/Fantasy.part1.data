               INT. SUNNYVALE - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT - 2002

               EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically 
               hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest 
               are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain.

               FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting 
               for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each 
               other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's 
               desk. He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand.

                                     EVAN
                              (as he writes)
                         If anyone finds this, then I guess 
                         my plan didn't work and I'm already 
                         dead...

               He takes a deep breath.

                                     EVAN
                         But if I can just go back to the 
                         beginning of all this, I still might 
                         be able to save her.

               Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...

               INT. BUSY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY - 1982

               TITLE: TWENTY YEARS EARLIER

               ANDREA TREBORN, twenty-five, an attractive pregnant woman 
               strapped to a gurney, is rolled down a busy hospital corridor. 
               She is clearly ready to give birth, and as she flails her 
               arms, she knocks another patient's IV bottle into the wall.

               Smiling Andrea holds baby Evan up to the camera, then places 
               him in a crib.

               EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY - 1983

               A playground. Evan's father, JASON (23), puts a 1-year old

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY - 1987

               A birthday party for LENNY, 5, a chubby kid with only a few 
               friends. Evan, now 5, is gently prodded by Andrea toward 
               KAYLEIGH, 5, a quiet sweet-looking girl with beautiful hair.

               Evan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and 
               kisses his cheek.

               He blushes and runs to hug his mother's leg.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - 1989

               In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky 
               cocker spaniel puppy.

               Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on 
               the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he 
               watches his mother work.

                                     ANDREA
                         Okay, okay... what now?

               Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench 
               from the toolbox.

                                     EVAN
                         We're gonna be late again.

                                     ANDREA
                         When did you ever care about getting 
                         to school on time?

                                     EVAN
                         We're putting up pictures for Parent's 
                         Night.

               Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt.

                                     EVAN
                         Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll 
                         have plenty of time.

               The carburetor will not set properly. She bangs on it with 
               the wrench.

                                     ANDREA
                              (re: carb)
                         Darn it!

                                     EVAN
                         Um... can dad come this time?

                                     ANDREA
                              (getting impatient)
                         You know the answer to that.

                                     EVAN
                         Can't he come out for one day?

                                     ANDREA
                         We've been over this a hundred times. 
                         It's too dangerous for him.

                                     EVAN
                         But Lenny said that his dad's 
                         coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's 
                         dad...

               Andrea hands the wrench to Evan.

                                     ANDREA
                         Here, Ev... Finish this up for me.

               Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb 
               back together.

               Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a 
               spotless nurse's uniform underneath.

                                     EVAN
                         All the dads are gonna be there.

                                     ANDREA
                         I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not 
                         so bad, am I?

                                     EVAN
                         No.

                                     ANDREA
                         Good. Because I've been waiting to 
                         see your art projects all week and 
                         I'd feel terrible if all you thought 
                         about was your father not being there.

               Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea.

                                     EVAN
                              (beat)
                         Done. Try it.

               Andrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the 
               engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile.

                                     ANDREA
                         You're amazing, kiddo.

               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING - 1989

               Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main 
               doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on 
               the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks 
               her watch.

                                     ANDREA
                         Okay have a great day I love you 
                         I'll pick you up later gotta go...

               Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. 
               As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with 
                         you!

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm sorry, but can it wait til 
                         tonight? I'm already late for work --

               Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         I think you really need to see this.

               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               The classroom is filled with screaming, running children. 
               Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately 
               calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a 
               whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE 
                         ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE!

               Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, 
               but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, 
               sweet-looking girl.

               Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         I was going to show this to the 
                         principal, but I wanted to talk to 
                         you first.

                                     ANDREA
                         What is it?

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         Yesterday I had all the children 
                         draw pictures of what they wanted to 
                         be when they grew up. Most of them 
                         made drawings of what their parents 
                         did, but this...

               Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls 
               out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it.

                                     ANDREA
                         I don't understand... Evan did this?

               The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while 
               standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely 
               sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have 
               been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically 
               correct.

               Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, 
               and struggles to control her concern.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thank you for showing it to me first. 
                         I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I 
                         have the picture?

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         Of course. There is one more thing, 
                         Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for 
                         mentioning it...

                                     ANDREA
                         What?

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         When I asked Evan about his drawing, 
                         well, he didn't remember doing it.

               Andrea is visibly shaken now.

                                     ANDREA
                         I have to go.

               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER

               Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot 
               even start the car.

               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

               The children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's 
               Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made 
               from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture 
               (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and 
               himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each 
               show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is 
               stuck to the far end of page.

               Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear 
               family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused.

                                     LENNY
                         You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. 
                         Boswell has macaroni and glue if you 
                         wanna fix it.  

                                     TOMMY
                         You're such a retard!

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Mommy lives far away but she comes 
                         and visits.

                                     LENNY
                              (to Tommy)
                         If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy 
                         move away from me?

               Tommy gets upset. He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture 
               and his macaroni "mother" crumbles to the floor. Lenny begins 
               to cry.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, what'd you do that for?

                                     TOMMY
                         Fat little baby, crying for mommy.

               Evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         Come on, Lenny. It's not that bad. 
                         You can still see your mom a little.

               Lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of 
               control. His desperate gasps for breath are frightening.

               Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find 
               her. He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his 
               own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over Lenny's 
               picture. It's a nuclear family again. Lenny slowly is able 
               to catch his breath.

                                     LENNY
                              (grateful)
                         Can... can... Can I have this?

                                     EVAN
                         Sure. I was gonna make a new one, 
                         anyway.

               Kayleigh helps Lenny glue a new "mother" in place and she 
               smiles gratefully at Evan.

               As Evan smiles back at Kayleigh, Mrs. Boswell calmly enters 
               the room in time to see Evan tacking up his butchered family 
               portrait. She shivers.

               INT. SUNNYVALE - DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               DR. HARLON REDFIELD, 40, a handsome and extremely genial

                         And you say he doesn't remember any 
                         of it?

                              (anxious)
                         Not according to his teacher. It 
                         just got me thinking about Jason and 
                         what if Evan's inherited his father's 
                         condition?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not 
                         jump to conclusions. I'll run some 
                         preliminary tests, see what we can 
                         rule out.

               Andrea nods and forces a thankful smile.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight 
                         and we'll run a CAT-scan series.

               EXT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - NIGHT

               The looming building looks even more frightening at night. 
               Andrea and Evan head up the stairs.

                                     EVAN
                         I don't like this place, Mom. It's 
                         creepy. Please can we go? I promise 
                         I won't make any more bad pictures!

                                     ANDREA
                              (lighthearted)
                         You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just 
                         wants to give you some tests. You'll 
                         like him.

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - NIGHT

               Andrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office. Dr. Redfield 
               warmly greets Evan at the door.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet 
                         you.
                              (to Andrea)
                         He's as handsome as his father.

                                     EVAN
                              (stunned)
                         You know my father?

               Before Dr. Redfield can answer, Andrea cuts him off.

                                     ANDREA
                         That's why I wanted you to come here, 
                         Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a 
                         background in memory loss.

                                     EVAN
                         My father has a bad memory, too?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                              (off Andrea's look)
                         Uh, tell you what, Evan. If it's 
                         okay with your mother, I'd like to 
                         run some tests. Nothing scary.

               Evan raises an eyebrow at the doctor.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Okay, it might be a little scary...

               INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

               Evan looks terrified as he lies on a medical platform as a 
               series of CAT-scan images are taken. In another part of the 
               room, a distressed Andrea speaks quietly with Dr. Redfield.

                                     ANDREA
                         Just tell me that Evan doesn't have 
                         Jason's illness...

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test 
                         negative for brain disorders. But 
                         there's something else you can try 
                         to monitor his memory.

                                     ANDREA
                         Anything.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         A journal. Just have him write down 
                         everything he does.

                                     ANDREA
                         Why? What for?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It could be extremely useful to jog 
                         his memory. See if he remembers 
                         anything new the next day. And I'll 
                         have the test results back in a few 
                         days.

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

               The next morning. Evan busily writes in his new black-marble 
               mead comp book:

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy. I 
               will mete there father and see what a real dad is like. Maybe 
               one day I will mete my Dad."

               Andrea, meanwhile, speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky 
               Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thanks, George. I really appreciate 
                         you watching him, he won't be any 
                         trouble at all.

               Evan puts down the journal and eats breakfast. He separates 
               the green clovers from the cereal and drops them to the floor 
               for Crockett to nibble.

                                     EVAN
                         These'll bring you luck, Crockett.

                                     ANDREA
                              (into phone)
                         Great. I'll see you soon.

               Andrea hangs up the phone and walks into the next room.

               INT. HOUSE - DAY

               Andrea grabs the pocket book off the coffee table and heads 
               back into the kitchen. She drops her purse in shock when she 
               sees: Evan, in doorway, expressionless and holding a large 
               BUTCHER KNIFE by his side.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan?

               Evan sees her but remains expressionless.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan? What are you doing with that 
                         knife?

               Life suddenly springs into Evan's face. He seems stunned to 
               find himself holding the knife and drops it.

                                     EVAN
                              (scared)
                         What happened?

                                     ANDREA
                         Honey. What were you doing with that?

                                     EVAN
                              (tears welling)
                         I... I don't remember.

               EXT. MILLER HOUSE - MORNING

               Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE 
               MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile. 
               He approaches the car and opens the door for Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Hey, Andrea.
                              (to Evan)
                         Hello little man.

               Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets 
               out.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thanks a lot George. Here's my work 
                         number in case there are any problems.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (lighthearted laughter)
                         Whaddaya kidding? We're going to 
                         have a great time today, right Evan?

               Andrea nods thanks and nervously drives away. Evan walks up 
               to Mr. Miller and momentarily reaches for his hand. Mr. Miller 
               flinches his hand away and chuckles at Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         You waiting for an invitation? The 
                         kids are inside.

               Evan appears confused for a moment at Mr. Miller's unexpected 
               rudeness, but walks inside.

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY

               Evan enters the well-kept middle class home and sees his 
               classmates Kayleigh and Tommy. Kayleigh is dressed in a make-
               shift Medieval gown and Tommy is also dressed in a period 
               costume.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (excited to see Evan)
                         Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video 
                         camera and we're all gonna be in a 
                         movie.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't think Evan gets to be in it --

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin 
                         Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and 
                         you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!

                                     TOMMY
                         I thought I was the bad guy!

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.

               Mr. Miller, holding a full glass of scotch in one hand, sets 
               the circa-80's bulky video camera on a tripod and plugs it 
               into the porta-deck.

                                     EVAN
                         We're really gonna be in a movie!?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         That's right, Evan, and you get to 
                         be the star.

                                     TOMMY
                         I thought I was the star.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Shut up, moron. Now get in your 
                         costume, Evan. And you have to 
                         promise, your bestest super-duper 
                         promise, that this will be our little 
                         secret. Think you can do that?

               Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air. Mr. 
               Miller downs his drink and helps Evan off with his clothes. 
               Suddenly --

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

               Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place. The rec-room/basement. 
               Evan's eyes dart from the fireplace to Mr. Miller's camera 
               lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles 
               slightly.

               Panic spreads across Evan's face.

                                     EVAN
                         Where am I? What happened? Where did 
                         we all go?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Calm down, kid. Stand still.

               Evan backs up and awkwardly scurries around the basement, 
               grabbing his clothes.

               Panicking.

                                     EVAN
                         I was just somewhere else -- how did 
                         I get here?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Quit acting like some retard or I'll 
                         call your mother and tell her what a 
                         naughty little shit you've been.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh? What happened?

               Kayleigh's eyes are unable to leave the floor. She begins 
               adjusting her disheveled clothing. Evan trembles.

                                     EVAN
                         What's wrong with me?

               Tommy silently watches from the top of the basement stairs, 
               absently wringing the head off one of his sister's dolls.

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY

               Dr. Redfield places Evan's CAT-scan slides on the light box. 
               Andrea squints, unable to interpret them.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Well, the good news is that the 
                         results are negative. I've found no 
                         evidence in the way of lesions, 
                         hemorrhaging, tumors...

                                     ANDREA
                         And the bad news?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Unfortunately, we've got nothing to 
                         work with. It's harder playing 
                         detective now.

                                     ANDREA
                         But you must have something to go 
                         on?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         If I had to guess, I'd say the 
                         blackouts are stress related.

                                     ANDREA
                         But he's seven. What kind of stress 
                         can he have?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got 
                         severe coping problems about not 
                         having a father. Did you say the 
                         last blackout occurred when he was 
                         with his friend's dad.

                         Come on, I doubt the answer's that 
                         simple.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         You'd be surprised how often they 
                         are.

                                     ANDREA
                         Well, he has been pushing me to meet 
                         his father, but I've been putting it 
                         off.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It's worth a shot. I can arrange a 
                         controlled meeting. A careful dose 
                         of sedatives for Jason, some security, 
                         you and I monitoring. Evan comes in 
                         for a quick visit and with any luck, 
                         no more missing father complex.

                         How soon?...

               INT. ANDREA'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Evan, dressed in his Sunday best, writes copiously in a 
               journal marked "AGE 7."

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "April 15. Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason 
               and he is crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad."

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY

               Andrea tightly grips Evan's hand as the pair follow Dr. 
               Redfield down a corridor. Evan's enthusiasm is dampened by 
               the sounds of distant screams and bloodcurdling laughter.

                                     EVAN
                         Dad lives here?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Not in this wing, actually. No.

                                     ANDREA
                         Now your father may seem sleepy to 
                         you, but that's just because of his 
                         medicine, okay?

                                     EVAN
                         Okay.

               They walk to the end of the corridor and come to a "Visitor's 
               Chamber".

               Dr.Redfield leads Evan inside. Andrea begins to follow, but 
               the doctor gestures that she stay outside.

               INT. SUNNYVALE - VISITOR'S CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

               Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table. His eyes are 
               fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, 
               a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass.

               JASON, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room. His eyes 
               want to sparkle at seeing his son for the first time. But 
               tranquilizers have dulled the effect.

               Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that 
               hinder Jason's movement. Finally Jason sits.

               He smiles warmly and speaks in over-enunciated tones.

                                     JASON
                         It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen 
                         pictures of me, right?

                                     EVAN
                         Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes 
                         and your --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SUNNYVALE - VISITOR'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Evan "comes to" in another unfamiliar place. Rather than 
               seeing his father across a table, he's looking up at a 
               ceiling.

               Blocking his view of the ceiling is Jason, whose face is now 
               monstrous with rage, and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around 
               Evan's throat, choking the life out of him.

                                     JASON
                              (through clenched 
                              teeth)
                         I... love... you.

               Suddenly, ORDERLIES tackle Jason from both sides and wedge a 
               baton under his jaw to wrench him away. Andrea frantically 
               struggles to rescue Evan from Jason's clutches.

                                     JASON
                              (panicking)
                         He has to die! You don't understand! 
                         It's the only way to stop it!

               Jason wrestles the baton from under his chin, hits an orderly 
               in the kneecap and comes for Evan with the baton!

               Orderly #2 acts quickly, beating Jason with his baton. As 
               Jason makes another desperate grab for Evan, Orderly #2 is 
               forced to bash him in the skull. Down for the count.

               Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock.

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm sorry, Evan. I'm sorry.

               And ALARM sounds and Andrea tries to cover Evan's eyes, but 
               through her fingers he can see a quick blur of a pool of 
               blood spreading from Jason's head.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - 1989

               Dressed in black, Andrea and Evan watch Jason's casket being 
               lowered into the ground. Andrea's tears soak through her 
               veil. A few feet back, Kayleigh stands behind Evan.

                                     PRIEST
                         Ashes to ashes... dust to dust.

               Evan watches the coffin descend, disappearing from sight. 
               Kayleigh steps up to Evan and takes his hand. A moment. And 
               she softly whispers in Evan's ear.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're better off anyway.

               A rumble of thunder. Evan looks up at the brooding dark 
               clouds.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

               Gray skies. Andrea drives the children home. Evan stares at 
               the passing tombstones that flutter by like a white picket 
               fence. The flickering strobe effect that intensifies into a 
               white blur is hypnotic.

                                                        SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY - 1995

               Bright and sunny. The lawn freshly cut. A Toro lawnmower has 
               been carelessly left in the grass-strewn driveway.

               TITLE: SIX YEARS LATER

               CRANE DOWN to the window of the --

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT

               Evan, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny are now THIRTEEN. Evan exhales 
               cigarette smoke, taps his ash and finishes sketching a 
               portrait of Kayleigh in his journal.

               Tommy wears a leather jacket and now has traces of peach 
               fuzz on his upper lip.

               Kayleigh's hair is longer now, albeit stringy and unkempt.

               Evan closes his journal and coolly ignites a STRIKE-ANYWHERE 
               MATCH with his thumb and lights Kayleigh's cigarette. Everyone 
               but Lenny smokes in the basement.

               Tommy, now with longer hair, ransacks his father's army locker 
               looking for something.

                                     EVAN
                         Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. 
                         What's up already?

                                     TOMMY
                         Hold your horses, man. It's here 
                         somewhere. I saw it when I was a 
                         kid.

               Tommy absently chucks an old Playboy toward Lenny. Kayleigh 
               seems uncomfortable by the sight of it.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (to Tommy)
                         We should go soon. If Dad catches us 
                         smoking down here, we're dead.

                                     EVAN
                         So let's go. This place creeps me 
                         out.

               Evan claps his hands and stands up, Lenny and Kayleigh join 
               him. Finally, Tommy shakes an old army thermos and hears 
               something rattling inside.

                                     TOMMY
                         I knew it had something to do with 
                         the army.

               Tommy opens the thermos, tips it over and a blockbuster (1/4 
               stick of dynamite) spills out. Tommy grins mischievously.

                                     TOMMY
                         Let's blow the shit out of something!

               EXT. HALPERNS' FOREST - DAY

               Tommy leads Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny on a mission through 
               the woods. Everyone smokes except Lenny, yet he's the only 
               one who's wheezing. He pulls out an inhaler and takes a puff.

                                     LENNY
                         Guys, slow up, would you?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Evan, did I tell you? My mother said 
                         I might be able to visit her this 
                         summer in Orlando with her new family.

                                     TOMMY
                         What did I say about mentioning that 
                         bitch?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (uncomfortable)
                         Where the hell are you taking us 
                         anyway? Just blow something up 
                         already.

                                     TOMMY
                         Just blow something up? Are you nuts? 
                         There's an art to mass destruction. 
                         Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? 
                         No. Besides, we're here already.

               Now at the edge of the woods, Tommy spots:

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

               A MAILBOX sits at the end of the driveway. It's exquisite. 
               An exact replica of a Colonial home it serves.

               Across the street, Tommy hands the blockbuster to Lenny.

                                     TOMMY
                         Here you go, buddy.

                                     LENNY
                              (recoiling)
                         What? No frigging way, man. I'm not 
                         touching that thing.

                                     TOMMY
                         The hell you aren't. Anyone of us 
                         does it, you'll puss out and narc 
                         for sure.

                                     LENNY
                         Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. 
                         Look how small that fuse is! I'll 
                         get killed.

                                     EVAN
                         Not necessarily.

               All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks 
               off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end.

                                     EVAN
                         That should buy you ten minutes at 
                         least.

                                     LENNY
                         Gee, thanks friend.

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

               Lenny paces back and forth next to the three-story mailbox, 
               desperately trying to appear nonchalant. He pretends to notice 
               his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it. From the woods, 
               the other kids watch anxiously.

                                     TOMMY
                         Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it, 
                         Lenny.

               Finally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox. Then sprints 
               like hell to the woods. Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and 
               hands it to him when he gets back.

                                     LENNY
                              (taking puff)
                         Thanks.

               Evan pats Lenny on the back.

                                     EVAN
                         You got balls, man.

               The four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation. Evan 
               smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips 
               and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears. She smiles back 
               at him and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches 
               this and seems disturbed, and quickly turns back to --

               The mailbox. Tick-tock... tick-tock... It's like a staring 
               contest...

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. HALPERNS' FOREST - DAY

               Evan, running full speed, comes to in an unfamiliar place. 
               He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground. Lenny, 
               falling on top of him.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! 
                         Come on!

                                     EVAN
                              (frantic)
                         What happened?? Where are we?!

               Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being 
               followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying 
               him. Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed. Evan doubles 
               back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through 
               the woods as fast as they can.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (crying)
                         Oh God... what did we do?

                                     EVAN
                         Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! 
                         We've gotta get help!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

               Andrea's car screeches to the curb of Lenny's house. Lenny's 
               mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance.

               As Andrea rushes up to the ambulance, Mrs. Kagan gives her 
               an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in Andrea's face. 
               Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop.

                                     ANDREA
                         What is it? What happened?

                                     TOMMY
                              (staring menacingly 
                              at the others)
                         We were just building a fort in the 
                         woods when Lenny freaked out. One 
                         minute he was fine, then he just 
                         froze up. Right guys?

                                     ANDREA
                         What happened, Evan? The truth.

                                     EVAN
                         I don't know... I don't remember.

                                     ANDREA
                         Something must've happened! What set 
                         him off?

                                     EVAN
                         I... I blacked out.

                                     ANDREA
                              (building frustration)
                         Don't try to use your blackouts to 
                         get out of this one!

               Evan looks helpless.

                                     ANDREA
                         You're not making this up, are you?

               Evan shakes his head "no". Almost ashamed...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFCIE - DAY

               Evan lies on a couch.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         With every breath you exhale, you 
                         can feel all of the tension draining 
                         from your body like water through a 
                         faucet. Nine, ten, and you're 
                         completely asleep. Relaxed.

               Evan breathes slowly. Deeply. Andrea watches nervously from 
               the far side of the room.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Now I want you to go back to the 
                         time you were in the woods with Lenny. 
                         Think of it like a movie. You can 
                         pause, rewind, or slow down any 
                         details you wish. Understand?

                                     EVAN
                         Yes.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Where are you now?

                                     EVAN
                         I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my 
                         hands are over her ears.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Are you hurting her?

                                     EVAN
                         No, protecting her.

               Andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Okay. Then go a little forward in 
                         time. What do you see now?

                                     EVAN
                         I see a car.

               Evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Yes, tell me about the car.

               Evan moans and begins shaking.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, 
                         this is only a movie. You're 
                         completely safe.

                                     EVAN
                              (moaning)
                         I can't... the car vanishes and all 
                         of a sudden I'm on the ground in the 
                         woods.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         The car doesn't vanish Evan. The 
                         movie in your head has broken, that's 
                         all. But now I've re-spliced it and 
                         I want you to tell me about the car.

                                     EVAN
                         It's coming... argh! I can't!

               Evan moans and shakes on the couch.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Fight it Evan. Hurry. It's coming!

               Blood begins to trickle from Evan's nose as a guttural sound 
               is uttered from deep within him. Dr. Redfield bolts upright 
               in his chair and redirects the session.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Okay, Evan. Listen to my voice! On 
                         the count of ten, you're going to 
                         wake up. Feeling refreshed and 
                         remembering everything we talked 
                         about.  

               Evan moans in agony. Andrea darts into the room.

                                     ANDREA
                         What's happening to him?? Make it 
                         stop!

               Dr. Redfield waves her away and concentrates on Evan.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         One. You're feeling more awake now. 
                         Two, your eyes no longer feel heavy.

               Andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from Evan's nose. She 
               lifts Evan's eyelids and sees only the whites of his eyes.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Five. Six. Refreshed and awake! Seven, 
                         eight. Come on, Evan, wake up, dammit!

               Evan is completely non-responsive.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan wake up, oh please wake up!

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open 
                         your eyes, dammit!

               Nothing but moans and blood. Dr. Redfield frantically opens 
               some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts. He breaks a 
               small capsule under evan's mouth, pinches his bleeding nose 
               closed and lets Evan inhale the vapor through his mouth.

               Evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off. Holding his 
               bloody nose.

                                     EVAN
                         What happened? Did it work?

               Evan deduces the answer from everyone's horrified faces.

               EXT. MULTIPLEX THEATER - PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Andrea drops off Evan, Kayleigh and Tommy outside the complex. 
               Kayleigh, looking morose, shuts the car door and Andrea drives 
               off. They walk through the parking lot.

                                     TOMMY
                              (to Kayleigh)
                         Wipe that sad-assed look off your 
                         face before you get us all busted. 
                         You see the way Evan's mom was looking 
                         at you?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EVAN
                         Would someone just tell me already 
                         what the hell happened in the mailbox?

               On "mailbox", Tommy suddenly grabs Evan's jacket and SHOVES 
               him against a parked car. Tommy looks around to make sure 
               nobody heard anything.

                                     TOMMY
                         Don't ever bring that shit up again. 
                         Not ever. Not to me, not to Kayleigh, 
                         or even Lenny. The stupid fuck if he 
                         ever learns to talk again. Understand?

               Evan nods, scared. Tommy gives a final shove.

                                     TOMMY
                         Ever.
                              (re: Kayleigh)
                         She don't want to talk about it, 
                         anyway. Do you Kayleigh?

               Tommy's right. Kayleigh clearly doesn't.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER LOBBY - DUSK

               Kayleigh shuffles behind Evan and Tommy as they head toward 
               the theatre. Evan drops back.

                                     EVAN
                         Are you okay?

               Kayleigh says nothing as Tommy sees the theatre playing SEVEN 
               and whispers.

                                     TOMMY
                         There it is. Let's go.

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Andrea does the dishes as the TV plays a NEWSCAST in the 
               b.g.

                                     ANCHOR
                              (on TV)
                         ...was the grizzly aftermath of what 
                         police officials of upstate New York 
                         are calling a horrible act of 
                         vandalism gone awry.

               Andrea turns to the TV, blocking our view. We can only hear 
               the report as she watches intensely.

                                     ANCHOR
                         The powerful explosion is believed 
                         to have been caused by a small 
                         quantity of dynamite.

               Andrea's face looks haunted by the on-screen images. She 
               shakes her head in terror and grabs the remote.

                                     ANCHOR
                         Police thus far have no leads as to 
                         the suspects...

               She clicks off the TV, trembling.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER - NIGHT

               The movie's in progress. Evan and Kayleigh sit behind Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck! 
                         You'd have to wipe his ass with a 
                         forklift!

               Some crowd members TURN around and give Tommy a SHUSH. Tommy 
               whips M&Ms at them.

                                     TOMMY
                         Shut up, faggot. No one's talking to 
                         you!

               Kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs 
               out. Evan follows.

               INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

               Evan follows her to a small alcove.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad 
                         idea.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You really don't remember anything 
                         that happened?

               Evan shakes his head "no". She looks devastated.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're so lucky.

               She begins to cry. Evan makes sure no one's staring.

                                     EVAN
                         It's going to be okay. Lenny'll be 
                         fine. You'll see.

               He reaches to comfort her. But she winces.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Ouch.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm sorry.

               She pulls her sleeve up, revealing a large bruise.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called 
                         dad and blamed us for what happened 
                         to Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         Damn. Your dad did this?

               Kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, 
               darker bruise.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (looking down)
                         I deserve a lot worse.

                                     EVAN
                         What are you talking about? What you 
                         deserve is a better brother and 
                         father. All they do is make you feel 
                         like shit.

               She looks into his eyes.

                                     EVAN
                         You really have no clue how beautiful 
                         you are, do you?

               She searches his eyes for sincerity. And finds it. They lean 
               into each other for a TENDER KISS. After a moment, a ROAR 
               from nearby.

                                     TOMMY (O.S.)
                         What the fuck are you doing??

               They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring 
               at them from across a small crowd. By now, some teens chuckle 
               at Tommy.

                                     TEEN PUNK (O.S.)
                         Buying popcorn, what the fuck are 
                         you doing?

               Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan. His hands in 
               fists. Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy. Tommy 
               falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him.

               Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan. Hatred oozing.

               Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what 
               you're thinking.

               Tommy suddenly lunges at the TEEN PUNK who must be at least 
               a foot taller than he is. Tommy lands a flurry of punches 
               before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently 
               taking opportunities to eyeball Evan.

               Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's FRIENDS look on helplessly 
               when TWO SECURITY GUARDS SEIZE TOMMY. Tommy valiantly 
               struggles against them at first. But the moment he realizes 
               it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack.

               As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick 
               smile on his face.  Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless.

               INT. ANDREA'S CAR - NIGHT

               Andrea drives through the winding roads.

               CLOSE UP

               Andrea's eyes. Tormented.

               REVEAL she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan's up front 
               and Kayleigh sits behind them. Everyone silent.

               Andrea stares through the rearview mirror into Kayleigh's 
               eyes. Probing. Searching.

                                     ANDREA
                         So how was the movie?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Okay.

               Andrea watches Kayleigh. A calculated beat.

                                     ANDREA
                         Any exploding mailboxes?

               Kayleigh flinches at the question. And Andrea catches it. 
               Evan can't help but look back at Kayleigh. Oh my god, she 
               knows.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (faking poorly)
                         What do you mean?

               Andrea pulls the car over and stops. After a moment, Kayleigh 
               realizes she's at her house. She exits the car in a hurry.

                                     ANDREA
                         Goodnight.

               Andrea stares at Evan, who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead. 
               She finally shifts the car into gear.

                                     ANDREA
                         We're moving.

               Evan says nothing.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               A "For Sale" sign is now planted on the front lawn. Andrea, 
               in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car.

               INT. ANDREA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Evan discreetly watches her leave through the window. Grabs 
               his coat and exits frame.

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house.

                                     EVAN
                         I can't believe Tommy's still pissed 
                         at me. He knows I'm moving away, 
                         right?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         He's been acting real strange lately. 
                         He won't even look me in the eyes 
                         anymore.

                                     EVAN
                         Duck, here they come.

               As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh 
               duck in nearby bushes.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Did your mom say if Lenny was... 
                         okay?

                                     EVAN
                         He must be. They're letting him go, 
                         right?

               The station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Evan puts 
               on a smile and charges the car, pounding the window.

                                     EVAN
                         Welcome home, Lenny!

               Inside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror. Mrs. Kagan looks 
               angry as she rolls the window down.

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                         I think your little homecoming's in 
                         bad taste.

               The smile fades from Evan's face. Kayleigh hangs back.

                                     EVAN
                         Sorry?

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                              (acidic)
                         Lenny's been through a hell of an 
                         ordeal no thanks to you.

               Evan and Kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up 
               and Mrs. Kagan continues into the garage.

               INT. LENNY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Alone, Lenny concentrates on a MODEL AIRPLANE. There is a 
               sudden KNOCK at the window. Lenny's head jerks around to see 
               Evan and Kayleigh smiling through the window.

               EXT. LENNY'S WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

               Evan and Kayleigh stand on the ivy-covered trellis.

                                     EVAN
                              (quietly)
                         Welcome home. Thought you might like 
                         some fresh air for a change.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Hi, Lenny.

               Lenny twitches ever-so-slightly.

                                     LENNY
                         Is Tommy with you guys?

               Evan shakes his head "no".

                                     EVAN
                         It's cool.

               Lenny looks back at the model airplane. Needs to think.

               EXT. JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY

               Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (to Lenny)
                         So what did you do in there?

                                     LENNY
                         It was awful. You can't sleep 'cause 
                         everyone's screaming all night long. 
                         I never want to go back.

               As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column 
               of smoke billowing in the horizon.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Do you see that?

               Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke. Lenny nervously 
               follows behind.

               They exit the woods to find:

               EXT. JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS

               Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses 
               with lighter fluid.

               Next to a campfire.

                                     EVAN
                         Crockett!!

               Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog. 
               Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks 
               up a wooden plank and SWINGS! Evan ducks back at the last 
               minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head.

               Knocking her unconscious.

                                     TOMMY
                         Look what you made me do!

                                     EVAN
                         What's wrong with you?!

               Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's 
               knee cap. BASH! Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the 
               ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett 
               squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid.

               Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart 
               from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped 
               in the tied gunny sack.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh! Wake up!

               No response.

                                     TOMMY
                         Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince 
                         Charming!

               Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from 
               the campfire to the fluid soaked dog.

               As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands 
               up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy at FULL SPEED --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

               Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place. Still in running mode. 
               His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he 
               is now lying face down on the ground.

               Evan regains himself and sits up painfully. His face is badly 
               bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.

                                     EVAN
                         How long was I out?

               He gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same 
               spot. Tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of Kayleigh 
               weeping. Evan spins to face her.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh?! Are you okay? Where's 
                         Crockett?

               Kayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to 
               answer through her tears. Evan struggles to rise but he 
               becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground.

               Evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack, smouldering 
               then moans and buries his head in his hands.

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               A small neighborhood CROWD has gathered to watch an ambulance 
               with the SUNNYVALE insignia take an entranced Lenny away. 
               Mrs. Kagan is about to climb in the rear when she stops and 
               turns to Evan.

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                              (ice cold)
                         Do you know what you are? A monster.

               Evan stands there, speechless.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - DAY

               A packed U-HAUL sits in front of Evan's house. Andrea shifts 
               the small truck into gear and slowly pulls out.

               Outside the truck, Kayleigh waves to Evan, tears spilling 
               shamelessly down her cheeks. Evan reaches behind his seat 
               and opens a large cardboard box. It is filled with past 
               journals. He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and 
               writes something.

               Finished he presses the journal to the window.

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "I'll come back for you."

               Evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his 
               own tears as she fades into the distance.

               When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to 
               see what he's written.

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm sorry.

               Evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY - 2002

               TITLE: SEVEN YEARS LATER

               Evan, twenty now, continues writing in a college Blue Book. 
               He is older, dressed down in worn jeans, T-shirt and plaid 
               flannel. He closes the Blue Book with a cocky grin just as 
               PROFESSOR CARTER, 40, calls out to the class:

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Time! Please place your blue books 
                         on my desk before you leave.

               Evan grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, gets 
               up and turns in his exam.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         How'd you do, Evan?

               Evan flashes a confident smile.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm not sure. I might have gotten 
                         some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov 
                         condition his dogs to lick his nuts?

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                              (laughing)
                         Typical psych major. A complete wise 
                         ass. And how's your project coming? 
                         Still planning to change the way we 
                         humble scientists view memory 
                         assimilation?

                                     EVAN
                              (shrugging)
                         Hey, I got no choice.

               Professor Carter nods solemnly, obviously in the know.

               EXT. COLLEGE - QUAD - DAY

               Evan bikes past students.

               EXT. COLLEGE - FRAT HOUSE - DAY

               Evan bikes past some obnoxious GREEKS.

               EXT. COLLEGE - EVAN'S DORM - DAY

               Evan docks his bike and carries his knapsack inside.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - MOMENTS LATER

               Evan's dorm is cluttered "double" whose walls are adorned 
               with head-shop posters of Gothic rock bands.

               By Evan's bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia, 
               memory loss, fugues, hypnotism and other related bands.

               Evan's roommate, THUMPER, 19, is a completely punked out 
               Gothic boy who weighs 300 pounds. He currently hands a black 
               lacy dress to CRICKET, 17, a pierced Goth co-ed. She slips 
               the tattered dress on as Thumper wipes his post-coital self 
               off with a black tee-shirt.

               Evan barges through the door, throwing his pscyh books on 
               the bed and politely looking away from the half-naked girl.

                                     EVAN
                         Whoa. Smells like patchouli and... 
                         ass.

               Evan opens the window and checks out his Psych project: a 
               small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of 
               cornflakes at the other.

                                     THUMPER
                         Cricket, meet my well-mannered 
                         roommate, Evan.

               Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms.

                                     CRICKET
                         Yeah, you're the one who fucked up 
                         the bell-curve on my Anthropology 
                         final. Later, Thumper.

                                     EVAN
                         Nice to meet you, too.

               As she leaves, Thumper takes the black T-shirt by his wallet 
               and throws it on Evan's bed.

                                     THUMPER
                         Here, bro. Found your T-shirt.

               Evan nods thanks, picks up his journal. Reads something and 
               smiles.

                                     EVAN
                         Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking 
                         me out for my birthday.

                                     THUMPER
                         I thought you were a December baby.

                                     EVAN
                         This is bigger. Seven years to the 
                         day. No blackouts.

               Thumper pulls out a bong.

                                     THUMPER
                         Let's do this.

               EXT. DIRTY HANK'S BAR - DAY

               INT. DIRTY HANK'S BAR - CONTINUOUS

               A popular watering hole. A dark rustic interior, blasting 
               alternative rock.

               Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their 
               tables.

               Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. HEIDI, 
               beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up. She sinks the 
               eleven ball off the rail. KRISTEN coolly smokes a cigarette, 
               confident that she and Heidi will hold the table.

                                     KRISTEN
                         So... which one of you has a pet 
                         worm?

               Thumper proudly steps forward.

                                     THUMPER
                         Worms, plural.

                                     KRISTEN
                         That's so gross.

               Thumper steps back, points to Evan.

                                     THUMPER
                         Talk to him about it, he's got the 
                         fetish.

               Heidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan strangely.

                                     EVAN
                         Actually, they're for a psych project. 
                         A study on memory.

               Heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan.

                                     HEIDI
                              (stifling a yawn)
                         Shit, better explain before all the 
                         excitement gives me a heart attack.

               Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket. 
               As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, 
               including HUNTER, SPENCER, and GWEN make fun of Thumper.

                                     EVAN
                         It's an experiment with flatworms 
                         and a maze. You take a flatworm and 
                         run it through the maze until he's 
                         memorized it. Then you put a new 
                         flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. 
                         Banging into walls, getting lost, 
                         whatever.

                                     THUMPER
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Like Ozzy.

               Gwen giggles as Spencer throws popcorn at Thumper's head.

                                     SPENCER
                         Ten bucks says he eats it off the 
                         floor.

               Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the 
               three-ball in the side.

                                     EVAN
                         You chop up the smart flatworm and 
                         feed it to the dumb one and presto, 
                         the dumb one suddenly knows the maze 
                         inside and out.

               Evan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to 
               squeeze by. The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi 
               doesn't mind. He sinks another ball.

                                     EVAN
                         Just by absorbing the first worm 
                         into its cellular structure, it gets 
                         all of the worm's memories.

                                     THUMPER
                              (thoughtfully)
                         That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's 
                         so smart.

               A handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face. They all try to 
               ignore Hunter and Spencer's jeers.

                                     HEIDI
                         So what's the point?

                                     EVAN
                              (setting up the eight)
                         Maybe if I can figure out how the 
                         memories of a simple worm function, 
                         it'll help me understand the 
                         complexities of the human brain.

               Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Although 
               his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the 
               opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks.

                                     HEIDI
                              (intrigued)
                         So are you planning on becoming a 
                         doctor or something?

               Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan.

                                     EVAN
                         No, I just don't want to lose my 
                         mind.

               As Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot... 
               The eight ball.

               CRASH!!! The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing 
               into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table. They're all 
               soaked with beer and debris.

               Just as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on 
               the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a 
               spear). They sit the fuck down.

               Kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around Thumper's 
               waist. He smiles coolly, it's nothing.

                                     EVAN
                              (to Heidi)
                         I think that's your game.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall 
               on the bed. Evan's shirt is unbuttoned and Heidi strokes his 
               chest. Suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air.

                                     HEIDI
                         Smells like sex in here.

                                     EVAN
                         Thumper had a busy afternoon.

                                     HEIDI
                         You're kidding. He's so... big.

               Evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the 
               mini-fridge.

                                     EVAN
                         Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, 
                         I guess. Wanna beer?

               Heidi takes one. Looks under the bed.

                                     HEIDI
                         Most guys tuck their porn under here, 
                         but all you have are... comp books.

                                     EVAN
                         Yeah. I've been keeping journals 
                         since I was seven.

                                     HEIDI
                              (respectfully)
                         Wow... read something.

               Evan chugs his beer and sits next to her on the bed and puts 
               his arm around her. Very drunk.

                                     EVAN
                         No way, I'd be too embarrassed.

               Heidi teasingly runs her fingers over his smooth torso.

                                     HEIDI
                         Then keep drinking, worm-boy. You're 
                         too uptight.

               Evan stops short.

                                     EVAN
                         Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," 
                         and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once 
                         you get a nickname like that you 
                         can't shake it. And I don't want 
                         everyone thinking I've got tapeworms 
                         coming out of my ass or something, 
                         okay?

                                     HEIDI
                              (laughing)
                         Deal. Now read me something.

               Heidi hands him a book marked "AGE 13". He flips it open to 
               a random place and takes the beer from her hand.

                                     EVAN
                              (re: her beer)
                         For courage.

               Evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading. As he 
               reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out.

                                     EVAN
                         It's like my mind refused to believe 
                         what it was seeing. Hearing Crockett 
                         make those awful screams... Just 
                         writing about it gives me the shivers.

               Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's 
               reading. He looks over at Heidi, who kisses him.

                                     HEIDI
                         Come on, go on...

                                     EVAN
                         It was like Tommy was possessed or 
                         something. There was a hate in his 
                         eyes that I couldn't really call 
                         human.

               As Evan reads, the world seems to ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY VIBRATE 
               around him LIKE A TUNING FORK. His voice becomes distant and 
               SOUNDS ECHO around him like distant memories resurrecting 
               themselves...

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY - 1995

               Evan is THIRTEEN again. The scene begins exactly where Evan's 
               blackout occurred as a child. Tommy has just knocked Kayleigh 
               unconscious with a wooden plank, Lenny is frozen at the sight 
               of Crockett in the fluid-soaked gunny sack. And Evan, seething 
               with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy 
               at full speed.

               Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings.

                                     EVAN
                         What the hell is going on?

               Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and 
               swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling 
               backwards, his forehead bleeding freely.

               Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan 
               writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves 
               toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the 
               rope that traps Crockett inside.

                                     LENNY
                         I can't undo the rope!

               Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile.

                                     TOMMY
                         Drop it or I'll slit your mother's 
                         throat in her sleep.

               As if on cue, Lenny does exactly as he's told. His eyes begin 
               to glaze over.

               Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of 
               strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on.

                                     EVAN
                         I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett!

               Lenny remains frozen in place. Tommy yanks his leg back, 
               breaking Evan's grip.

               Evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap.

               Tommy's voice hitches. His eyes water from pent up 
               frustration.

                                     TOMMY
                         Listen to me good, Evan. There's a 
                         million other sisters in the world. 
                         You didn't have to fuck with mine.

               Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy 
               pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the 
               campfire to the soaked gunny sack.

               WHOOSH OF FLAMES

               And Evan passes out.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002

               Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh my God! No! No!

               Heidi rolls her eyes.

                                     HEIDI
                         Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream.

               She stands and angrily puts on her jacket.

                                     EVAN
                              (freaked out)
                         It didn't feel like a dream.

                                     HEIDI
                         Maybe because they never do.
                              (sarcastic)
                         So Don Juan, you pass out on all 
                         your dates?

               Evan doesn't even hear her. After getting his bearings, he 
               grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded.

               INT. EVAN'S CAR - SUNRISE

               Evan drives...

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Evan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Very 
               little has changed in the past seven years.

               INT. LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               ANGLE ON LENNY

               Now 20, making a model airplane. He's still overweight and 
               looks like his mother dresses him.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               The room is filled with model airplanes. Hundreds of them.

               A KNOCK on Lenny's bedroom door. Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, 
               opens the door and escorts Evan inside. She glares at Evan 
               while pretending to be cheerful.

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                         I've got a surprise for you, Lenny. 
                         You'll never guess who's here.

               Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops.

               ANGLE ON EVAN

               Looking around, shocked to see:

               PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM.

               Nothing has changed in the past seven years. 

               The same kids' toys, posters and comic books.

               AS WE PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO LENNY

               We see he's working on the model again, in his own world. 
               The window of opportunity for conversation has closed.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, uh, it's me. Evan.

               Silence. Lenny frowns.

                                     EVAN
                         What's that you're working on? A 
                         model?

               Nothing.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, you look busy, so maybe I should 
                         make this quick. I'd totally 
                         understand if you didn't want to get 
                         into this right now, but that day at 
                         the junkyard, could you help me 
                         remember what happened? Any details?

               No response. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk.

                                     LENNY
                         I couldn't cut the rope.

                                     EVAN
                              (containing excitement)
                         Yeah, good, what else do you remember?

                                     LENNY
                         Drop it or I'll slit your mother's 
                         throat in her sleep.

               Evan, startled, drops the model on the desk. An epiphany.

                                     EVAN
                         Jesus Christ. It really happened.

               Lenny stares out the window.

                                     EVAN
                         What if I can get back all my lost 
                         memories with my journals.

               With lightning speed, Lenny jumps from his desk and 
               unexpectedly shoves EVAN IN TO THE WALL. Squadrons of hanging 
               planes crash to the floor. Lenny digs his fingers into Evan's 
               shoulder.

                                     LENNY
                         Make one peep and I swear it'll be 
                         your last, motherfucker.

               Evan is terrified. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins 
               working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. 
               Evan is speechless.

               The door bursts open. Mrs. Kagan looks at the smashed model 
               airplanes by Evan's feet. Evan ignores her accusing stare.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, thanks for seeing me, man. I 
                         shouldn't have waited so long.

               When Lenny doesn't respond, Mrs. Kagan hustles Evan back 
               into the hallway.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins 
               pouring over them.

               Nearby, Thumper empties a can of hairspray into his Mohawk.

                                     THUMPER
                         You really think he wanted to kill 
                         you?

                                     EVAN
                         All I know is that I might be able 
                         to unblock some of my repressed 
                         memories.

               He finds something he's looking for, marks the page with a 
               yellow post-it note marked, BLACKOUT and sets the book in a 
               separate pile.

               As he sets the next journal on the bed, it automatically 
               opens up to a place where the spine was bent. Staring up at 
               him is the message:

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "I will come back for you."

               Evan looks overcome by guilt.

               Later that evening:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan has now organized a pile of five journals. He selects 
               an entry, begins reading and suddenly closes the journal. 
               Fear covers his face. He holds one of his hands up and isn't 
               surprised to see it trembling.

               He opens his journal again and reads out loud.

                                     EVAN
                              (reading aloud)
                         The last thing I remember before the 
                         blackout was holding my hands over 
                         Kayleigh's ears...
                              (his voice slowly 
                              fades)
                         I think I was more focused on her 
                         hands on mine than the mailbox across 
                         the street...

               His own words grow reverberant, distant. Furthermore, the 
               walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - DAY - 1995

               Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the 
               mailbox across the street with intense anticipation.

               When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently 
               drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt, 
               SMOLDERING.

               The mailbox... tick-tock, tick-tock... Like a staring contest.

                                     LENNY
                         Maybe it went out. Should someone 
                         check it?

                                     TOMMY
                         Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

               Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls 
               into the driveway.

               MRS. HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of 
               the car and walks to the mailbox.

               Across the street, Tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of 
               Lenny's shoulder.

                                     TOMMY
                         Make one peep and I swear it'll be 
                         your last, motherfucker.

               Tommy's words make Evan flinch. From inside the car, a BABY 
               begins to cry. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car.

               Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in 
               pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the 
               lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing 
               a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach.

                                     MRS. HALPERN
                         How's my sweet girl? Awww, you need 
                         a change, don't you honey?

               Mrs. Halpern picks her up and carries her to the house. As 
               the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids 
               break into wide smiles of relief. But wait...

               The mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to 
               the mailbox. Now Tommy is the only one left still smiling.

                                     MRS. HALPERN
                         You want to open the door, honey?

               The baby fumbles with the mailbox's door handle for a moment --

               ANGLE ON KIDS' FACES

               BOOM!!!

               The blast is deafening. Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the 
               results in stunned horror.

                                     TOMMY
                         C'mon! Run!!

               Evan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run 
               a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them.

                                     TOMMY
                         Lenny? Come on!

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh my God oh my God...

               Lenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson 
               road. Evan and Tommy double back and grab him. They try to 
               make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply 
               against the ground. Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin 
               to run with Lenny through the woods.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan comes to. Lurches his body over the bed and vomits.

               Sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room. Looking sick 
               and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the 
               cigarette burn.

                                     EVAN
                         What the hell?

               In the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops 
               up from above a NAKED GESELA'S waist.

                                     THUMPER
                         Christ, man. You wanna clean that up 
                         before I lose my appetite here?

               Evan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins 
               of the journal.

               INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

               The lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, 
               posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND.

               Carefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward 
               the bustling elevators. Evan leans against the side of a pay 
               phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise.

                                     EVAN
                         Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is 
                         Evan Treborn.
                              (rolling eyes)
                         I know. I'm sorry about that. But I 
                         really need to speak with him.

               She's obviously hung up on him. Suddenly, a HAND grabs his 
               shoulder. It's PROFESSOR CARTER.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. 
                         Just wanted to know how the flatworms 
                         project was coming.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of 
                         crazy lately with my mom coming up, 
                         so I haven't...

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         I know, I know. Who can think of 
                         worms when your libido's in full 
                         swing, right?

               Evan shrugs and forces a smile.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Just don't drop the ball, okay?

                                     EVAN
                         I won't let you down, Professor 
                         Carter.

               Carter waves to another student and her parents and walks 
               away.

               INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A waiter clears the dishes away from Evan and Andrea's table.

               REVEAL ANDREA

               Her hair now has gray streaks. As she signs for the bill, 
               she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek.

                                     EVAN
                         Please, mom. People will talk.

                                     ANDREA
                         I can't help it. I'm just so proud 
                         of you. You've got the highest grades 
                         in all of your classes.

                                     EVAN
                         Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?

                                     ANDREA
                              (smiling)
                         Please. He got straight A's without 
                         ever touching a book. That was the 
                         one area where his memory never failed 
                         him.

                                     EVAN
                         Ma? Did he ever say that he figured 
                         out a way to recall a lost memory 
                         years after he blacked it out for 
                         the first time?

               Andrea's smile fades.

                                     ANDREA
                         Why do you ask?

                                     EVAN
                         No, it's just weird with him being 
                         such a brain and all, I just wondered 
                         if he was ever able to remember stuff 
                         he'd forgotten.

                                     ANDREA
                         When he was around your age... almost 
                         exactly your age. He said he figured 
                         out a trick to remember the past.

               Evan tries not to react.

                                     ANDREA
                         I couldn't tell if they were real 
                         memories or just phantoms. You know, 
                         he might only have thought he actually 
                         remembered them...

                                     EVAN
                         Sure...

                                     ANDREA
                         And then, just before it got so bad 
                         that he had to be committed, he said 
                         that he could...

                                     EVAN
                         What? What could he do?

               Andrea shakes her head.

                                     ANDREA
                         Forget it. It's nothing. He was far 
                         too sick by then.

               Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room 
               looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly 
               watches Evan with growing concern.

                                     EVAN
                              (reading aloud)
                         I never wanted to be in the movie 
                         anyway and it was cold so I wanted 
                         to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller 
                         took his shirt off --

                                     THUMPER
                         What the fuck are you doing?

                                     EVAN
                         Shhh! I need quiet for this.

               Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away.

                                     THUMPER
                         Are you stupid or what?

                                     EVAN
                         What?

                                     THUMPER
                         Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a 
                         reason why you've repressed the one 
                         day when some old lecher had you in 
                         your tighty whities, dammit!

               Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. A bitter laugh.

                                     THUMPER
                         Yeah, man. I'd think twice about 
                         this. You could wake up a lot more 
                         fucked up than you are now.

               He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins 
               reading it silently.

               His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in 
               defeat.

               INT. EVAN'S CAR - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Evan, looking haggard and frail, wipes the greasy hair from 
               his eyes and punches the accelerator. His teeth are clenched 
               and he hammers his fist on the dashboard.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - EVENING

               Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. He eyes a 
               piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out.

               INT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - CONTINUOUS

               A run-down greasy spoon. Filled with a number of TOWNIES and 
               TRUCKERS. The place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears 
               decorated in grime motif.

               Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of 
               the kitchen with a tray full of food.

               Kayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin. She bangs 
               her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to 
               the floor. Her BOSS stares back in aggravation.

                                     BOSS
                         Can we get through one goddamned day 
                         without you breaking something?

               Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up 
               the order. She is humiliated and Evan leans back against a 
               pay phone so that she can't see him watching her.

               As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches 
               her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. 
               She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the 
               customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably.

               EXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - NIGHT

               Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she 
               exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, 
               but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her 
               face and she allows herself to be hugged.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         God, Evan! I never thought I'd see 
                         you again. How've you been?

                                     EVAN
                         Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a 
                         long time. Fill me in.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm going to State now. Things are 
                         going okay. I guess. Mom's good...

               Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches 
               into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes.

                                     EVAN
                              (declining)
                         Not since we were kids.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I've stopped a hundred times.

                                     EVAN
                         So how's Tommy?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (takes a long drag)
                         They kept him in juvy for a few years. 
                         Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.

               Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question.

                                     EVAN
                         You still live with your dad?

               Her face is betrayed by a slight tick.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         No. I emancipated myself when I was 
                         fifteen.

                                     EVAN
                         Wow. That must've taken some courage.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Not if you remember my dad.

                                     EVAN
                         Couldn't you have moved in with your 
                         mom?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (shaking her head)
                         She had a new family. Not enough 
                         space for me. Said I should have 
                         moved in with her when we were kids. 
                         But... whatever.

               They walk in silence for a moment.

                                     EVAN
                         Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I 
                         came back to town was to talk to 
                         you.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (brightening)
                         Me? Are you kidding? Why?

                                     EVAN
                         Remember when I was a kid I had all 
                         these blackouts?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Of course.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, lately some of the memories 
                         have begun to come back and I'd kinda 
                         like to talk to you about one of 
                         them in particular. It'd be a big 
                         help.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, sure. I'll try to remember. 
                         Shoot.

                                     EVAN
                         When we were kids. Your dad was making 
                         a movie. Robin Hood or something?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (cold)
                         What do you want to know, Evan?

                                     EVAN
                         It's just... did he... what happened 
                         in the basement?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It was a long time ago.

                                     EVAN
                         I know, but...

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (cold)
                         Is that why you came all the way 
                         back? To ask a lot of stupid questions 
                         about Robin Hood?

                                     EVAN
                         No, but I think something really bad 
                         might've happened to us.

               Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Is there a point to any of this?

               Evan's features shift from inquisitory to tenderness. He 
               steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face. She 
               flinches at first, but remains in the same spot.

                                     EVAN
                         Whatever happened, it wasn't our 
                         fault. You know we couldn't have 
                         stopped it.

               Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow.

                                     EVAN
                         Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like 
                         bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't 
                         spoken to you in seven years...

               She moves her face away from his hand.

                                     EVAN
                         But you were seven years old and 
                         there's nothing you could've done to 
                         deserve...

               Her face collapses and she turns away.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (defeated)
                         Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting 
                         your breath.

                                     EVAN
                         You can't hate yourself just because 
                         your dad's a twisted freak.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! 
                         You come all the way out here to 
                         stir up my shit just because you had 
                         a bad memory!? You want me to cry on 
                         your shoulder and tell you that 
                         everything's all better now? Well 
                         fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be 
                         all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets 
                         better!

               Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         If I was so wonderful, Evan, why 
                         didn't you ever call me? Why'd you 
                         leave me here to rot?!

               She turns and runs away. Evan looks sick with guilt.

               EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY - 2002

               A few GREEKS play frisbee and talk trash. Evan, tired and 
               depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn 
               scar on his belly. Contemplating...

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's 
               bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. He chokes out a 
               message.

                                     THUMPER
                         Some dude left a message for you.

               Evan puts a towel under the door.

                                     EVAN
                         You can smell it all the way in the 
                         bathroom.

               Evan hits "play" on the answering machine.

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (male voice)
                         Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter. 
                         Just wondered why you didn't hand in 
                         your essay this afternoon. I was a 
                         bit concerned. Call me to schedule a 
                         make-up.

               BEEP. Thumper offers Evan a magnified frown of disapproval.

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (male voice)
                         What did you say to my sister 
                         motherfucker?! Last night she cried 
                         on the phone for over an hour to me.
                              (enraged breathing)
                         She said you came and saw her last 
                         night.

               Thumper coughs accidentally, tips the bong over on Evan's 
               bed. Reacting quickly, he grabs a towel from under the door 
               and wipes off Evan's comforter.

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (Tommy; cont'd)
                         She... she fucking killed herself 
                         tonight. She's dead.
                              (beat)
                         And so are you.

               BEEP. Evan stares dumbstruck at the machine.

                                     THUMPER
                         Whoa, bad news, bro. I don't think 
                         this is gonna come out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Evan, dressed in black, gets out of his car at the edge of 
               the cemetery. A small cluster of friends and family gather 
               at the grave. Evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking 
               to the grave. When he suddenly spots Mr. Miller and Tommy.  
               Evan's hands tense up into fists. He becomes weak in the 
               knees and stops walking. After an uncomfortable moment of 
               standing still, he retreats to his car and watches the 
               ceremony from the driver's seat.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The last of the mourners are filing away. Evan exits his car 
               and walks to the deserted grave. He drops the roses on the 
               casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching.

               Evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper. 
               He unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite:

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "I'll come back for you."

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               He makes a weighty decision and gets up. He hastily hunts 
               through his journals, looking for a certain book.

               Evan opens his journal marked "Age 7". He plops on his bed 
               and starts writing sideways in the margins.

                                     EVAN (V.O.)
                         It's been said that a person's life 
                         is little more than the sum of his 
                         experiences. If that's true, then 
                         I'm not sure I know who I am anymore.
                              (beat)
                         I definitely never knew Kayleigh.

               He turns the page and begins reading the journal. As he mouths 
               the entry to himself, the resonance of an older man's voice 
               seems to REVERBERATE throughout the room and the WORLD behind 
               his head FAINTLY VIBRATES.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1989

               Mr. Miller plays with his camera and the kids are excited 
               about playing Robin Hood in a movie.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Shut up moron. Now get in your costume 
                         Evan.

               Evan slowly nods and begins to strip out of his clothes. Mr. 
               Miller takes a quick peek at him.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         I've got an idea. Let's go downstairs, 
                         it'll look more like a dungeon down 
                         there.

               INT. MILLER'S BASEMENT - DAY - 1989

               Mr. Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement. 
               Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the 
               camera. Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, 
               looking down.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (to Tommy)
                         What did I say about keeping that 
                         door closed, stupid?

                                     TOMMY
                         But I wanna see!

                                     MR. MILLER
                         You're gonna see my fist in about 
                         two seconds unless you do what I 
                         tell you.

               Tommy sulks and closes the door. Mr. Miller lowers his voice 
               and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Now in this part of the story, Robin 
                         Hood just married Maid Marian and 
                         they have to kiss and stuff like 
                         grown-ups do.

               Kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand. Evan 
               looks skeptical.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         So take your clothes off Kayleigh.

               Kayleigh stops giggling. Evan says nothing.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Come on, like when you take a bath. 
                         Don't make a deal out of it. You 
                         too, Evan.

               Mr. Miller gets behind the lens. The room is dead silent.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Let's go.

               ANGLE ON TOMMY

               Who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs 
               and watches with horror.

               Evan's face is flushed with rage. He walks behind Kayleigh 
               and cups his hands tightly around her ears. She can't hear 
               anything now.

                                     EVAN
                         What time is it?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         It's time for you to stand where the 
                         hell I told you.

                                     EVAN
                         Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the 
                         very moment of your reckoning. In 
                         the next thirty seconds you're going 
                         to open one of two doors. The first 
                         door will forever traumatize your 
                         own flesh and blood.

               The mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a 
               seven-year old. Mr. Miller looks around the room as if he's 
               the butt of some sick joke.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (stunned disbelief)
                         What's happened to -- How are you 
                         doing that?

                                     EVAN
                              (voice rising)
                         It'll change your daughter from a 
                         beautiful child into an empty shell 
                         whose only concept of trust was 
                         betrayed by her own sick pedophile 
                         father. Ultimately, it'll lead to 
                         her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (hoarse whisper)
                         Who -- who are you?

               Evan impatiently waves the question.

                                     EVAN
                         Let's just say you're being closely 
                         watched, George. Your other option 
                         is to get your porn off the rack and 
                         treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say 
                         like how a loving father treats his 
                         daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (choking)
                         ...yes.

                                     EVAN
                         Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw 
                         up again and I swear I'll flat out 
                         castrate you.

               The impact of the last sentence isn't lost on Mr. Miller.

                                     EVAN
                         One last thing.

               Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear. Kayleigh stares 
               at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers.

               Kayleigh looks into Evan's eyes for support. Evan nods go 
               on. His confidence brings a boldness to her lips.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Don't you ever touch me again.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         I -- I won't.

               Kayleigh summons her own new courage.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I'm cold. And I'm putting on my 
                         clothes.

               As he leaves to pick up her clothes, Evan grins.

                                     EVAN
                         What you need to do is discipline 
                         your son Tommy, because the kid's 
                         one sadistic pup.

               Hiding at the top of the basement stairs, Tommy recoils in 
               horror and picks up one of his sister's dolls and begins 
               twisting the head back and forth...

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - MORNING - 2002

               A broad smile lines Evan's face as he slowly wakes up from 
               his slumber. He suddenly grabs his head as if suffering from 
               a pounding migraine.

               MONTAGE OF SWIRLING MEMORIES

               Quick cuts and flashes of Evan and Kayleigh growing older -- 
               she seems more carefree now, full of life and less self- 
               conscious.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - DAY - 1989

               Evan pulls Kayleigh around in a little red wagon.

               INT. FAMILY RESTAURANT - DAY - 1989

               Evan and Kayleigh play in a tub of balls in the playroom.

               EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY - 1989

               Kayleigh pushes Evan on a tire swing.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER - NIGHT - 1995

               Tommy, glaring at Evan, thrashes the Teen Punk.

               EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY - 1995

               Burning sack in flames.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - STREET - 1995

               QUICK FLASH of the U-Haul driving away.

               EXT. BUS STATION - DAY - 1995

               At thirteen, Kayleigh spunkily hops off a GREYHOUND BUS and 
               runs into Evan's arms.

               EXT. ANDREA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY - 1995

               Still thirteen, Evan peddles his bike by his new house, 
               Kayleigh riding on the handlebars.

               More memory flashes of Evan and Kayleigh throughout the teen 
               years, they grow up as lovers now:

               EXT. LAKE - DAY - 1997

               Evan and Kayleigh have romantic picnic on a rowboat.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - SUNRISE - 2002

               Evan and Kayleigh watch the sunrise after senior prom.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - MORNING - 2002

               Finally the memory assault is over. Evan groans in pain as 
               blood trickles from his nose.

               An arm reaches over and touches his shoulder.

                                     KAYLEIGH (O.S.)
                         Honey, are you all right?

               Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him. Not only is 
               Kayleigh alive, but she's a ravishing beauty. Evan lurches 
               back from the shock of seeing Kayleigh and falls to the floor. 
               She sees Evan's nose bleed and her eyes go wide.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh my God, Evan. You're bleeding! 
                         Look at you!

               Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor.

                                     EVAN
                              (transfixed by her)
                         Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...
                              (looks around)
                         Incredible.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (purring)
                         Mmmm... You give good compliment. 
                         Clean up and come back to bed.

               He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority 
               plaques and pink preppy decor.

               Evan, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him 
               a tissue. He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed 
               and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and 
               brown suede jacket.

                                     EVAN
                         Where... where are my clothes?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Those are your clothes, silly.

               Evan frowns with distaste, grabs a towel and heads out.

               WE FOLLOW HIM INTO:

               INT. SORORITY BATHROOM - MORNING

               At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at 
               his reflection in the mirror. A nearby shower SHUTS OFF.

                                     EVAN
                         This is too amazing! Un-fucking-real!

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I wish I could get so excited about 
                         a nose bleed.

               Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats 
               from the bar, exit the shower naked.

                                     EVAN
                         Whoops. Sorry. My bad.

               Evan blushes and turns back to the mirror through which Gwen 
               dries herself with a towel while staring flirtatiously back 
               at Evan.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, you were with those assholes 
                         who threw popcorn at Thumper.

               Evan holds his temple in pain as another memory comes to 
               him.

                                     EVAN
                         And your name is... Gwen!

                                     GWEN
                         Seriously, Evan. Lay off the blow.

               She pats his ass and exits the bathroom.

               EXT. COLLEGE - QUAD - DAY - 2002

               Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches 
               the eye of every guy on campus. She and Evan stroll arm in 
               arm through the quad.

               Somehow, the world seems brighter now. Even the colors seem 
               more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world 
               we've known.

               MANY STUDENTS wave to Evan and call his name. He can't 
               remember all their names but it's kinda cool being the BMOC.

               Evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me 
                         over this, but do you remember when 
                         your dad first got his video camera? 

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well I remember he had one... but 
                         he, like, put it away after the first 
                         day. Why would that freak me out?

                                     EVAN
                         I dunno.
                              (goofy smile)
                         Just being weird.

               Kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the 
               ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Such a goofus. See you tonight.

               Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away. 
               After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself.

               INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

               Evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone and 
               dials a telephone number.

                                     EVAN
                              (to himself)
                         Come on, Mom, be there!

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (Andrea's voice)
                         Andrea,
                              (Evan's voice)
                         Evan,
                              (a strange, older 
                              man's voice)
                         And Chuck,
                              (all three)
                         Aren't home right now. You know what 
                         to do.

                                     EVAN
                              (off-guard)
                         Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck. Just calling 
                         to say hi and well, call me.

               Evan hangs up the phone, then checks his watch. No, wrist. 
               At that moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby.

                                     EVAN
                         Thumper! What time is it, man?

               Thumper eyes this strange preppy kid with distaste.

                                     THUMPER
                         Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?

                                     EVAN
                         Huh?

                                     THUMPER
                         Fuck off, frat boy.

               Thumper walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded.

               INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

               Evan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other 
               STUDENTS who are taking No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor 
               Carter's desk.

               Evan hears PEOPLE he cannot see calling his name. Somehow, 
               it's more creepy than cool. The Professor makes a loud 
               announcement.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Remember, everyone! Only two weeks 
                         until your science projects are due.

                                     EVAN
                              (quietly)
                         I still owe you an essay from last 
                         week. Is there any way I could get 
                         an extension?

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         And you are...?

                                     EVAN
                              (disappointed)
                         Evan Treborn.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now 
                         take a seat. The exam's about to 
                         begin.

               Evan walks up the aisle and takes a seat. As he sits down, 
               someone puts his ARM menacingly around Evan's throat.

               Evan flinches, turns around and sees Hunter, the frat guy 
               Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar.

                                     EVAN
                         Leave me alone, asshole. I didn't 
                         lay a hand on you, okay?

               Hunter bursts out laughing.

                                     HUNTER
                         Evan, you're hysterical. You study 
                         for this?

                                     EVAN
                              (awkward)
                         We'll find out soon enough.

                                     HUNTER
                              (laughing)
                         Me neither.

               Hunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam. 
               Evan's face brightens.

                                     EVAN
                         You're kidding. Are these the 
                         answers?!

                                     HUNTER
                         Damn, Evan, on the D.L.

                                     EVAN
                              (holding it lower)
                         Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do 
                         something really special for Kayleigh 
                         tomorrow. If I said I needed some 
                         help from you and the brothers...

                                     HUNTER
                         I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to 
                         do it.

               Evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row.

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex. She seems 
               incredibly satisfied, but he looks slightly uncomfortable.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh my God, that was good. Where'd 
                         you learn all those new tricks?

                                     EVAN
                         So it didn't feel... weird?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms 
                         weird.

               She giggles and snuggles into him. He's grateful for her 
               affection, but still looks uneasy. The PHONE RINGS and he 
               automatically answers it.

                                     EVAN
                         Yellow.

               Silence on the other end. More silence.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Fuck 'em.

               As Evan hangs up, he and Kayleigh share a giggle and he 
               resumes snuggle position.

                                     EVAN
                         What do you think it is about us 
                         that makes us so perfect? Like, 
                         looking back, whatever gave you the 
                         nerve to sneak out and visit me after 
                         I moved away?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (laughs)
                         As if my dad could've stopped me 
                         from seeing you. What's he gonna do 
                         to me?

               Evan smiles to himself. And hugs her tighter.

                                     EVAN
                         You think we'll always be together?

               For the first time she looks at him with concern.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         That is the plan, right? Hell or 
                         high water?

               He's in heaven, but plays it cool.

                                     EVAN
                         Just making sure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAY

               The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their 
               clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit.

               Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon 
               on a metal salad bowl that a poor THETA CHI PLEDGE wears as 
               a hat.

                                     EVAN
                         Order, order. So all you rushes know 
                         what you've got to do for me?

                                     THETA CHI PLEDGE
                              (correcting him)
                         Pledges, Sir Brother Evan, Sir.

                                     EVAN
                         Pledges, rushees, same difference. 
                         Now this is a one-time deal. You do 
                         all this for me and I'll never give 
                         you shit again. Promise.

               A buzz of excitement runs through the pledges.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FRAT HOUSE - ATTIC HALL - NIGHT

               It's peaceful now. Evan covers Kayleigh's eyes with his hands 
               as he leads her through the attic hallways. Both are dressed 
               to the nines.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I don't understand, where are you 
                         taking me?

                                     EVAN
                         You'll see.

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

               The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing Kayleigh 
               and Evan. Kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees:

               The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese 
               lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles. And elegant 
               romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve FORMALLY 
               DRESSED SERVANTS (previously seen pledges) who respectfully 
               stare ahead with the utmost class.

               Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by. 
               Kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I don't know what to say. It's 
                         beautiful.

                                     EVAN
                         Go on. Sit down.

               As she takes a step toward the table -- FLOWER PETALS shower 
               down on her. She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing 
               on ladders, delicately tossing pedals.

               Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Why are you doing all this for me?

                                     EVAN
                         Simple math. When I woke up this 
                         morning and saw your smile... I knew 
                         that I wanted to spend the rest of 
                         my life with you.

               Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. Her eyes 
               tell him she feels the same way. A magical moment.

               And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it 
               might as well be their first ever --

               Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.

                                     HUNTER
                         We been lookin' all over for you, 
                         man.

                                     SENIOR BROTHER
                         Someone trashed your car.

               The moment's gone. Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks.

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

               Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked 
               at the bottom of the hill. His face collapses.

               Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. 
               The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been 
               mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the 
               roof.

               The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG 
               COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror.

               By now a crowd has gathered. Evan runs up to people.

                                     EVAN
                              (panicked)
                         Did you see who did this? You see 
                         anyone?

               No one will answer with anything more than a shrug.

                                     HUNTER
                         Probably them Pika fuckers.

               But Kayleigh knows better. She stares at the collar.

                                     EVAN
                         How could he get away with this? 
                         Right in front of the goddamn frat 
                         house!

               A SENIOR BROTHER angrily calls him from the lawn.

                                     SENIOR BROTHER
                         Frat house? Hey man, would you call 
                         your "country" a "cunt"?

               Kayleigh shudders and Evan puts his arms around her.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Don't. He's probably watching.

               INT. FRAT HOUSE - EVAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door. 
               Evan can't help but look under the bed. No one. He then locks 
               the door, reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of 
               Pepper Spray.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's my fault. I should have told 
                         you he was released a few weeks ago.

                                     EVAN
                         Might'a been nice.
                              (re: pepper spray)
                         Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe 
                         one of the frat guys has a gun.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He 
                         wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying 
                         to scare you away from me.

                                     EVAN
                              (shaking the cannister)
                         Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (quietly)
                         It's not his fault, Evan. You knew 
                         how bad he had it when we were kids.

                                     EVAN
                         Don't give me this Oprah-book club 
                         bad upbringing shit, because you 
                         turned out fine.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (quietly)
                         My father never laid a hand on me. 
                         It's like the prick saved it all up 
                         for Tommy.

               Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. 
               Kayleigh's eyes plead for him to have compassion.

                                     EVAN
                         Fine, then. We'll let campus security 
                         deal with him.

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - NIGHT

               Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. 
               Evan seems especially paranoid. In the distance, some guy 
               vomits loudly.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Are you okay?

                                     EVAN
                         What do you mean?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's just... you've been acting kinda 
                         strange, you know?

                                     EVAN
                         Like how?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I don't know. You seem... different. 
                         You make weird jokes. Your accents 
                         changed. You don't even walk the 
                         same.

                                     EVAN
                         I walk differently?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I can't put my finger on it, but 
                         everything's a bit off. Even the 
                         dinner tonight. It was beautiful, 
                         but...

                                     EVAN
                         I know I've been actin strange lately. 
                         It's just that... I don't want 
                         anything to happen to us.

               The guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes. Kayleigh 
               and Evan instinctively avert their eyes. Suddenly, Kayleigh's 
               ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Wait. Something's not right. Isn't 
                         that your jacket?

                                     EVAN
                         What?

               The guy, wearing Evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs 
               to his feet, revealing his face for the first time.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Tommy.

               Tommy has grown in the last seven years. He has long, greasy 
               hair and some tattoos. He holds a TIRE THUMPER (a short, 
               steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand.

               Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat 
               pockets.

                                     EVAN
                         Leave us alone you sick fuck!

                                     TOMMY
                         Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna 
                         lay a hand on my own sister. You've 
                         done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice 
                         friends, nice life, not to mention 
                         you're fucking my sister. Not a bad 
                         piece of ass if I say so myself.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Shut up, Tommy!

                                     TOMMY
                         Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.

               Tommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper.

                                     EVAN
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     TOMMY
                         It wasn't enough that the whole world 
                         loves you, but you had to take away 
                         the last person on earth who didn't 
                         think I was a piece of shit.

                                     EVAN
                              (suppressing panic)
                         No one thinks you're a piece of shit, 
                         Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Right, Evan. I believe you just said 
                         "sick fuck."

               Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in 
               the shoulder and ribs.

               Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, 
               Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face.

               Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free 
               hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, 
               keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. 
               Kayleigh screams. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly 
               swinging the tire thumper. Evan charges forward in an 
               uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands 
               and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open 
               mouth.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!

                                     EVAN
                         He's a fucking maniac!

               Evan knocks Tommy down with the tire thumper. Kayleigh screams 
               and tries to hold Evan back, but he easily wrestles free of 
               her. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad.

                                     EVAN
                         He ruined Lenny's life --

               Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs. Kayleigh pushes a button 
               on the "Blue Light" lamp post and an ALARM WAILS.

                                     EVAN
                         He killed Crockett --
                              (kicks him)
                         Murdered that woman and her baby!
                              (kicks again)
                         And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh! 
                         He's trying to fucking kill me!

               Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings 
               down OFF CAMERA.

               CRUNCH!

               Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. 
               Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. And stops 
               cold when she sees the damage to Tommy.

               Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still 
               terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a 
               crablike fashion.

               SIRENS come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's 
               limp body.

               Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY

               A SECURITY VEHICLE pulls through the ominous metal gates of 
               the large state prison. The vehicle stops and Evan, along 
               with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints.

               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY

               Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters 
               the General Population area of the prison. PRISONERS begin 
               screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of 
               new inmates. Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward 
               his cell. Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over 
               the second tier, KARL, a huge muscular con with tattoos of 
               swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at 
               Evan and winks.

               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY

               Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus 
               Christ and various Saints. Burning flames on open cans of 
               shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine.

               There is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk. Sitting on 
               the bottom bunk is CARLOS, 30s, a massive Hispanic convict 
               covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony.

               Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his 
               bed on the top bunk.

                                     CARLOS
                         First time?

               Evan nods glumly.

                                     CARLOS
                         Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's 
                         luggage that way.

                                     EVAN
                              (desperate)
                         Can you protect me?

                                     CARLOS
                         Jesus himself couldn't make me take 
                         on the Brotherhood. When they come, 
                         just put your mind in another place, 
                         man. Be somewhere else.

               A BUZZER SOUNDS. Carlos leaves the cell without another word.

               INT. PRISON CAFETERIA - EVENING

               Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and 
               some other INMATES. No sooner has he sat down to eat, do 
               eager forks reach onto his tray and steal his food. Carlos 
               shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll.

               INT. MAVIS VISITING CHAMBER - DAY

               Andrea sits across from Evan in the visitor's chamber. Her 
               hair is now bottle-blonde. Four inches of Plexiglas separate 
               the two and they talk on monitored phones. Andrea, frazzled, 
               twirls an unlit cigarette.

                                     ANDREA
                         ...I spoke to your new lawyer about 
                         the appeal. He's sure he can get you 
                         off on self-defense, so if you're 
                         patient.

                                     EVAN
                         How long will I be in here?

                                     ANDREA
                         I don't know. These things take time.

                                     EVAN
                         How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?

               Andrea's look tells him to look for hope elsewhere.

                                     EVAN
                         What about my journals, Mom? Did you 
                         bring the ones I asked for?

               Andrea nods, holding up two comp books. "AGE 7" and "AGE 
               13".

                                     ANDREA
                         I found these. The others are still 
                         in storage.

                                     EVAN
                         Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them 
                         all!

                                     ANDREA
                         Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I 
                         think it's far more important to 
                         focus on your case right now.

               Evan looks as if he's about to disagree with her, but he 
               closes his mouth and placates her.

                                     EVAN
                         Sure, Mom. You're right. Just try to 
                         tell Kayleigh I'm sorry.

               And officer signals Evan and points to his watch.

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo. Promise 
                         me you'll hang on, Ev.

               They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone. He 
               hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear.

               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY

               Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching 
               his journals. As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches 
               over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch.

               Evan, totally violated, turns white with rage.

                                     KARL
                         Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.

               Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when --

               Another Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats Evan's journals out of his 
               hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he 
               rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at 
               the same time. A minor tug of war.

                                     EVAN
                         Let go! They're mine!

               Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn 
               pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental.

                                     EVAN
                         Motherfucker!

               Evan swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It's on! Rick 
               lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the 
               journals getting trampled. Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED 
               RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as 
               Rick and Evan look up to see --

               ANGLE ON

               OFFICER STATION. Officers aim rifles at the pair. From an 
               upper tier, even more officers with more rifles.

               Their barrels sight directly at Evan. Rick steps away, quick 
               to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals.

                                     KARL
                         We'll be comin' for you tonight, 
                         sister.

               Evan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few 
               pages on the floor.

               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY

               Evan enters the cell with a few entry pages. He looks through 
               them. Nothing there.

               Evan nods depressed, then sees the page from his "Age 7" 
               journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his 
               bed.

               INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

               Evan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches 
               whenever the occasional INMATE brushes against him. Evan is 
               completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack. Karl 
               makes himself visible among them, holding a journal. He reads:

                                     KARL
                              (from Evan's journal)
                         Today I found my grandfather's death 
                         certificate. He died in a nut house, 
                         just like my father. Mom denies it, 
                         but she thinks I'm gonna end up the 
                         same way...

               The other Supremacists start laughing and calling "looney" 
               and "nut job." Evan rushes past them and they make chicken 
               clucks at him.

               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

               Evan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other 
               prisoners working out.

               Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him 
               from across the yard. A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a 
               white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice.

               Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ 
               tattoos all over Carlos' back.

                                     EVAN
                         You're religious Carlos, you believe 
                         that bit about "the Lord works in 
                         mysterious ways?"

                                     CARLOS
                         Straight up.

                                     EVAN
                         Because I think he sent me to your 
                         cell on purpose. For you to help me.

                                     CARLOS
                         Shit. I knew you were crazy.

                                     EVAN
                         I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks 
                         to me in my dreams.

               Carlos scoffs whatever.

                                     EVAN
                         Pack of smokes says I can prove it 
                         to you.

               Carlos is suddenly interested.

               INT. EVAN'S CELL - LATER

               Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes 
               up a conversation.

               Carlos looks dumbfounded.

                                     EVAN
                         So when I'm out, I need you to watch 
                         my face and hands closely.

                                     CARLOS
                         You need to see the prison shrink, 
                         man.

               Their conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart 
               by, Evan looking up expectantly.

                                     EVAN
                         Anything today?

                                     CONVICT
                         Yep. Just not for you.

               Disappointed, Evan turns back to Carlos. Holds up his journal 
               entry.

                                     EVAN
                         Just tell me if anything weird 
                         happens.

                                     CARLOS
                         Weirder than this?

                                     EVAN
                         Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could 
                         happen I guess.

               Evan studies the page.

               JOURNAL ENTRY

               "On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing that I didn't 
               do. Mommy wont let me see it."

               Then as he starts reading it to himself, the bars behind him 
               almost imperceptibly VIBRATE --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY - 1989

               Evan, seven, COMES TO in an old familiar place. WE are back 
               in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class. All of the children 
               draw colorful pictures. Evan sees some paper spindles sitting 
               on Mrs. Boswell's desk. As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell 
               firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own 
               desk.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         No monkey business, Evan. Sit still 
                         and finish your drawing.

               Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. He 
               smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         That's great everyone! Just imagine 
                         anything you want to be. There are 
                         no limits.

               Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife, stands 
               over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick.

               When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the 
               two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer 
               a number of paper notes and messages.

               Evan looks over to see Mrs. Boswell holding up his drawing, 
               horrified.

                                     EVAN
                              (musically)
                         Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?

               She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven-
               year old strength to WHIP his hands down toward the spindles!

               The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant 
               where SOUNDSCAPES COLLIDE and the world behind him VIBRATES.

                                                         AND WE'RE BACK TO:

               INT. EVAN'S PRISON CELL - DAY - 2002

               Evan comes to as ECHOES OF SCREAMING CHILDREN FADE. Alertness 
               slowly creeps back up on him as he hears:

                                     CARLOS
                         Oh sweet Jesus. It's true. It's a 
                         miracle! A miracle!

               Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence.

                                     CARLOS
                         Your hands. The stigmata!

               Evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm.

                                     EVAN
                         What did you see? What did it look 
                         like?

                                     CARLOS
                              (laughing)
                         Signs of the Lord. They just appeared 
                         out of nowhere. I thought you were 
                         loco!

                                     EVAN
                         So you believe me?

               Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box 
               of cigarettes.

               INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Evan nervously approaches. A CREW of Aryans block his path.

                                     EVAN
                         I want to make a deal.

               The Aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with Karl, who 
               grins and signals to let Evan pass.

               INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters. 
               They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.

                                     EVAN
                         Look. I'm new to all this but I think 
                         I get how things work. You gotta 
                         join a gang or else end up dead meat.

               They continue to stare.

                                     EVAN
                         Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be 
                         with no niggers or spics. So how do 
                         we do this? You gotta work your way 
                         up, and I'm the new guy.
                              (looking ill)
                         So... should I... I mean, do I suck 
                         your dicks right now?

               Karl and Rick exchange looks.

                                     KARL
                         Is your blood pure?

                                     EVAN
                              (angry)
                         I ain't no fucking kike if that's 
                         what you mean.

               Rick stands. All muscle.

                                     RICK
                         Let's see what you got. And watch 
                         the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving 
                         without 'em.

               Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. 
               Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles. Evan looks 
               miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes 
               past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall 
               and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch!

               Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around 
               his ankles. Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's 
               face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf.

               Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, 
               as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell.

                                     EVAN
                         Carlos!

               Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses 
               his girth against the cell door.

               Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as 
               the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses 
               on the words. Chanting quickly.

                                     EVAN
                         We took the woods behind the junkyard 
                         just to make sure we wouldn't bump 
                         into Tommy. We hadn't seen the smoke 
                         yet.

               WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER. REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF 
               BARKING break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans 
               storming the cell behind him become a FRENETIC BLUR

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY - 1995

               Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Evan stumbles 
               at first, then rights himself. He seems strangely exhilarated. 
               A sinister victory smile.

                                     EVAN
                         Rot in hell you fucking animals.

               Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take. 
               Evan shrugs "just kidding" and looks around, getting his 
               bearings. He whips his hand out and stops them.

                                     EVAN
                         Wait. Before we --

               He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an 
               awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine 
               young girl. Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering 
               before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles.  
               Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE.

                                     EVAN
                         We need something to cut open the 
                         sack!

               Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity.

               Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a 
               razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers 
               it to Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         I want you to take this, Lenny. 
                         Today's your day of atonement. I 
                         know how guilty you feel about that 
                         woman and her baby --

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.

                                     EVAN
                              (frantic)
                         Now's the only time!
                              (to Lenny)
                         Today you get a chance to redeem 
                         yourself. Start over with a clean 
                         slate. Tabula rasa --

                                     LENNY
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're acting crazy!

                                     EVAN
                              (desperate; to Lenny)
                         Please. If you've ever trusted me 
                         before, trust me on this one.

               Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand.

                                     EVAN
                         Cut the rope.

               Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away.

               EXT. JUNKYARD - LATER

               Evan groans on the ground, writhing. Tommy's voice hitches, 
               eyes watering from pent up frustration.

                                     TOMMY
                         Listen to me good, Evan...

                                     EVAN
                         I'll do whatever you want. You don't 
                         want me to ever see Kayleigh again, 
                         fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, 
                         you kill him now and they'll stick 
                         you in juvy for sure. And I know 
                         you'd never leave your sister alone 
                         with your father.

               Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. A 
               look of understanding passes between them. Gratitude, even.

               Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes 
               screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell! With all of 
               the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way 
               through Tommy's throat!

               Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood. Evan surveys 
               the scene in shock:

                                     EVAN
                         Oh fuck, Lenny, no!

               Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in 
               his hands and freezes up completely. Kayleigh wakes up and 
               SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat.

               Meanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack.

               EVAN'S POV

               Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as 
               if operating a jack-hammer.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. COLLEGE - EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002

               Evan comes to in a familiar place. His original college dorm - 
               ONLY BACKWARDS.

                                     EVAN
                         Christ. Help me.

               He sits upright in bed and takes in his surroundings. When 
               suddenly, Evan clutches his head in severe pain.

               A MONTAGE OF IMAGES ASSAULT HIM:

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - DAY

               Color memories of Kayleigh's sorority fade to BLACK and WHITE 
               and dissipate.

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT - 2002

               Memories of Evan's vandalized car fade to BLACK and WHITE 
               and dissipate.

               INT. PENITENTIARY - DAY - 2002

               The faces of Karl and Rick all turn grainy...

               INT. COLLEGE - EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               As new images of THUMPER become more BRILLIANT.

               INT. SUNNYVALE - PADDED ROOM - DAY - 2005

               A new image overwhelms the others: Lenny, 13, with dark, 
               soulless eyes wearing a straight-jacket in a padded room.

               BACK TO EVAN:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan's eyes roll back in his head. He shakes uncontrollably 
               and blood pours from his nose.

               Thumper opens the door, sees Evan convulsing and jumps back 
               in horror. He scans the hallways for assistance.

                                     THUMPER
                         Someone call 9-1-1!

               INT. SUNNYVALE LABORATORY - DAY

               Evan lies on an examining table undergoing another series of 
               CAT-scans. The machines are now state of the art and the lab 
               room has been redecorated.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Andrea nervously chews her fingernails as she watches Dr. 
               Redfield post CAT-scan results on the light box. A young 
               nurse pushes Evan, in a wheelchair, into the doctor's office.

                                     EVAN
                         Okay, doc. What's the damage? How 
                         much time have I got?

                                     ANDREA
                         Cute, Evan.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It's a little complicated. I haven't 
                         seen results exactly like these 
                         before.

                                     EVAN
                         Are you sure? Not even with my father?

               Dr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Actually, these tests weren't 
                         available twenty years ago.

                                     ANDREA
                         So what did you find.

               Dr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, specifically, to 
               the outer lining of Evan's brain.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         This is where we're finding most of 
                         the hemorrhaging. The outer lining 
                         of the cerebral cortex.

                                     EVAN
                              (nonplussed)
                         Lemme guess. Would that be where the 
                         memories are stored?

               Dr. Redfield stares ahead. Transfixed by the slides.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         I've never seen anything like this. 
                         I've compared these to the ones taken 
                         last year, and there's evidence of 
                         severe hemorrhaging and massive neural 
                         reconstruction.

               Andrea stares at him blankly. Evan impatiently "pops wheelies" 
               in the wheel chair.

                                     ANDREA
                         What does that mean for Evan?

                                     EVAN
                              (to Andrea)
                         He's saying it's like forty years 
                         worth of new memories have been jammed 
                         in my brain since last year. Overload 
                         city. 'Sat about the gist of it, 
                         doc?

               Dr. Redfield nods, awed by Evan's effortless interpretation. 
               Evan springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs.

                                     EVAN
                              (to Andrea)
                         Mind if I wait in the car? The 
                         lighting here bugs my eyes.

               Andrea nods. Evan shakes Dr. Redfield's hand.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, it's nice seeing you again. 
                         But you know, people to see, things 
                         to read...

               Andrea shoots Dr. Redfield an apologetic look. Evan heads 
               out the door, accidentally knocking Dr. Redfield's jacket to 
               the floor. He shrugs apologetically and re-hangs it.

               INT. SUNNYVALE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               Outside the office, Evan inspects Dr. Redfield's KEYS and 
               attached SECURITY CARD and smiles. Evan covertly winds himself 
               through the maze of corridors, careful not to be seen by the 
               staff.

               He finally sees a wing marked "CRIMINALLY INSANE". Evan looks 
               around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the 
               security card to open the door. He looks in every room of 
               the wing until he finds --

               INT. SUNNYVALE - LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees.

               Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in 
               tight leather restraints. The dark five o'clock shadow and 
               his malicious grin radiate evil.

               His black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous 
               intent.

               Lenny seems neither surprised or happy to see Evan. That is, 
               if he's aware of Evan's presence at all...

                                     EVAN
                         Is there anything you need? Anything 
                         I can get you?

               Nothing from Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         What about the models, man? Bet I 
                         can get you a shitload of models up 
                         in here.

               Still nothing. Not even a glance in his direction. Evan sighs 
               and gives up.

                                     EVAN
                         Okay, Lenny. Just wanted to say "hi".

               Evan turns around to leave.

                                     LENNY
                         You knew the whole time, didn't you?
                              (Evan spins around)
                         When you put the blade in my hand, 
                         you knew something big was going to 
                         happen. Didn't you?!

                                     EVAN
                              (jaw dropped)
                         Y... yes. I guess I did.

               Lenny's eyes seethe with hate.

                                     LENNY
                         Then you should be where I am. You 
                         should be where I am.

               Evan backs away, face guilt-stricken.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY

               Evan enters his dormroom (where everything's backwards), 
               reaches under his bed and is relieved to find the journal 
               marked "AGE 7".

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY

               Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops 
               himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the 
               entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale.

               JOURNAL ENTRY

               "Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is 
               crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad."

               Evan takes a calming breath and begins reading.

                                     EVAN
                              (as if reciting a 
                              mantra)
                         Today I get to meet my father. His 
                         name is Jason and he is crazy...

               Evan gets some strange looks, but continues. As he does, the 
               trees and frisbee-playing students behind him VIBRATE and 
               SHUDDER.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SUNNYVALE VISITOR'S CHAMBER - DAY - 1989

               Seven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met 
               his father, Jason.

               Jason waits patiently for young Evan to finish his sentence.

                                     JASON
                         Are you okay? You looked like you 
                         were somewhere else for a second 
                         there.

                                     EVAN
                         Look, Jason, I need some fast answers 
                         if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.

               Jason is completely thrown.

                                     JASON
                         I was praying this curse would have 
                         ended with me.

                                     EVAN
                         But it didn't. And now I need info 
                         to make things right again and you're 
                         the only one who can give it to me.

                                     JASON
                              (frustrated)
                         There is no "right". When you change 
                         who people are, you destroy who they 
                         were.

                                     EVAN
                         Who's to say you can't make things 
                         better?

               Jason seems extremely upset to hear Evan say this.

                                     JASON
                         You can't play God, son. It must end 
                         with me. Just by being here, you may 
                         be killing your mother.

                                     EVAN
                         Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard 
                         when I've made everything perfect 
                         again.

               Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, 
               and grabs hold of Evan's throat.

               EVAN'S POV

               As Jason looks down at us, frothing at the mouth, there's a 
               trick of the light where Jason's head seems to VIBRATE against 
               the ceiling.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY - 2002

               Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he 
               realizes his surroundings. Heartbroken, he shuts the journal 
               and stands up shakily.

               INT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - EARLY EVENING

               Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As 
               he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively. 
               Guarding his food.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Just get out, didja?

                                     EVAN
                         Huh?

                                     WAITRESS
                              (re: his arm)
                         Nothing. Just that my brother did a 
                         stint in the pen and he used to eat 
                         like that.

                                     EVAN
                              (defensively)
                         I come from a big family.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Meant no offense.

                                     EVAN
                         None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh 
                         Miller still work here?

                                     WAITRESS
                              (confused)
                         Sorry. Never heard of her.

               EXT. MILLER HOUSE - EVENING

               Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated 
               mess. Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off 
               the sides of the house. Inside, Mr. Miller yells at someone.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Just shut the hell up already! Can't 
                         a man get a little goddman peace in 
                         his own home!
                              (Evan rings doorbell)
                         Oh, for Christ's sake, now what?

               Mr. Miller opens the door and sees Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Don't suppose you're here to sell 
                         cookies?

               In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves 
               him through the house and into a wall.

                                     EVAN
                         Good guess, fuckbag.
                              (off Miller's startled 
                              face)
                         Remember me now? We had a great chat 
                         once when I was seven.

               Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror.

                                     EVAN
                         One question, fuckbag. Where can I 
                         find your daughter?

               EXT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

               Evan walks past some junkies and enters.

               INT. SEEDY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

               Evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway 
               of an incredibly seedy motel. The kind with hourly rates. He 
               knocks on a door.

               Kayleigh, now haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and 
               immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes. She 
               puts out an expression of disappointment.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh, I thought you were my eight 
                         o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting 
                         someone.

                                     EVAN
                         Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?

               She looks around, waves him in.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         If I knew you were coming I'd have 
                         cleaned the stains off the sheets.

               INT. KAYLEIGH'S SEEDY HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, 
               yellowed cotton balls and brown-spotted squares of tin foil. 
               Evan doesn't hesitate to sit on the "soiled" bed.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         What do you want?

               Evan can't speak. His eyes begin to water.

                                     EVAN
                         I just needed to see... a friendly 
                         face.

               His sincerity touches her.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, time is money, Evan. So you...

               Evan reaches for his wallet and throws it on her dresser. 
               Kayleigh eyes the wallet. But makes no move to pick it up.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes 
                         for an old friend, right?

               Tears fall freely from Evan's eyes.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational 
                         humor.

                                     EVAN
                         I get it. You can drop it now.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (angry again)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work 
                         make you uncomfortable, precious?

                                     EVAN
                         No. Just that you need to hurt me 
                         with it. I've been where you've been.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Ha! Where's that?

                                     EVAN
                         The bottom. When you're just a piece 
                         of meat waiting for the next attack.

               Kayleigh watches Evan silently.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         What's happened to you?

                                     EVAN
                         You wouldn't believe me. I mean, 
                         people always say, "You wouldn't 
                         believe me", but in this case, it's 
                         not even worth trying.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I've seen some sickening shit. I 
                         don't blink twice anymore, especially 
                         in your case.

                                     EVAN
                         Why's that?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Because you're... different.

                                     EVAN
                         Different? How?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Let me ask you a question. Just a 
                         little one that's been gnawing at me 
                         for years.

                                     EVAN
                         Yeah?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         On the bridge. How did you know that 
                         Tommy had your dog? That was no 
                         fucking hunch.

                                     EVAN
                         Do you remember when I was a kid and 
                         I had those blackouts?

               Evan continues and Kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense 
               interest and matched skepticism.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO LATER:

               INT. DINER - NIGHT

               Kayleigh finishes a plateful of food at a busy diner. She 
               lights up an after-dinner smoke.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're right, Evan, I don't believe 
                         you.

                                     EVAN
                         I never thought you would. That's 
                         why I've never bothered to tell a 
                         soul until now, and why I never will 
                         again.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I'm the only person you've told? 
                         That's a great line. Does that make 
                         other girls swoon? Do they actually 
                         eat up this bullshit?

                                     EVAN
                         I couldn't give a shit if you believe 
                         me or not, and frankly I'm too tired 
                         to prove it to you.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh? There's proof now?

                                     EVAN
                              (tired)
                         Shit. I dunno. How would I know about 
                         the twin moles on your inner thigh?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Anyone with fifty bucks could tell 
                         you that.

                                     EVAN
                         Then forget that. How about... you 
                         prefer the smell of a skunk to 
                         flowers, you hate cilantro because 
                         for reasons unknown to you, it reminds 
                         you of your step-sister.

               Kayleigh's jaw drops.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh! And when you orgasm, your toes 
                         go numb. I'm sure your clientele 
                         aren't privy to that one.

               Kayleigh tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes.

                                     EVAN
                         I just thought you should know.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Know what?

                                     EVAN
                         That I didn't leave you there to 
                         rot.

               Kayleigh flinches as if her should had been invaded, then 
               her eyes fill with distrust and contempt.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         There's one major hole in your story.

                                     EVAN
                         Which is?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         There is no fuckin' way on this planet 
                         or any other that I was in some 
                         fuckin' sorority.

               She opens Evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Sure you don't want your wallet?

                                     EVAN
                         Don't think I'll need it where I'm 
                         going.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Off to change everyone's life again, 
                         is that it? Maybe this time you'll 
                         pop up in some mansion while I wind 
                         up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm over it. Whenever I try to help 
                         anyone it all turns to shit.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've 
                         already done so much for me. Hell, 
                         why don't you go back in time and 
                         save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then 
                         maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and 
                         ruin my family.

               She gets up and puts on her coat.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh, here's one! Go back when I'm 
                         seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's 
                         handicam, you know, straighten me 
                         out a bit...

               She tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY

               Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar 
               sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked GOTHIC CO-
               ED. On Evan's bed.

                                     EVAN
                         Get out. Both of you.

                                     THUMPER
                         Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be 
                         okay with you bein' sick and all.

               Evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it 
               against a wall above Thumper's head.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm not saying it again.

               Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets 
               and leave. Alone in the room, Evan looks under his bed and 
               breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are 
               intact. He sifts through them again. He finally finds the 
               passage he needs. Something catches the corner of Evan's 
               eyes and he turns to examine it.

               To the left of Thumper's Buddha statuette sits a large VOTIVE 
               CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ.

                                     EVAN
                              (humble)
                         Lord give me the strength and guidance 
                         I need to set things right.

               As he begins reading a passage to himself, SOUNDS ECHO 
               backward at us from another time and place. And the entire 
               ROOM SHIMMERS around him --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOUSE - DAY - 1995

               Evan comes to as he, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy -- all thirteen -- 
               watch Mrs. Halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across 
               the street with intense anticipation. Evan suddenly comes to 
               life and makes himself visible, running across the street 
               shouting.

                                     EVAN
                         Lady, stay back! Don't go near the 
                         mailbox!

               Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically 
               as she absently continues toward the mailbox.

                                     EVAN
                         I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

               Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and 
               Tommy shrugs and follows after him.

                                     LENNY
                         There's a bomb in the mailbox. Get 
                         away!

               Tommy, still running, cringes to hear Lenny's stupid 
               confession and rolls his eyes at the situation. Evan positions 
               himself between Mrs. Halpern and the mailbox, frantically 
               waving his hand at her to stay back, because she's STILL 
               COMING.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'll save you lady!

               Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit 
               too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, 
               but no major injuries.

               Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail --

               BOOM!

               The blast is deafening! Evan's body is hurled backwards 
               dramatically.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the 
               wall, the sheets are the same. Even the familiar sounds of 
               Thumper having sex under the covers.

                                     EVAN
                         I thought I told you two to beat it.

               Evan's face falls as he hears a familiar voice, but not 
               Thumper's.

                                     LENNY
                         What? Hey, sorry, man. We wake you 
                         up?

               Evan is confused by Lenny's presence, but smiles to himself 
               and shakes his head "no".

                                     EVAN
                         No, it's cool.
                              (re: Lenny's okay)
                         Really cool.

               Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no 
               hand. No arm, really, either. Just two FLESHY STUMPS!

               Evan bolts upright in bed and stares down at his amputations.

               A FLOOD OF MEMORIES ASSAULT HIM:

               We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up 
               from the age of thirteen with NO ARMS, and requiring a 
               WHEELCHAIR.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER LOBBY - DAY - 1995

               Tommy and Kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto Evan's lap 
               as Lenny pushes the wheelchair.

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - 1995

               Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles. 
               Andrea, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny all clap.

               EXT. CHURCH - DAY - 1995

               Tommy pushes Evan to church.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan screams as blood pours from his nose. Lenny is out of 
               bed at once to help him... as is KAYLEIGH! (Now beautiful 
               and natural looking).

               QUICK SERIES OF FLASHES:

               EXT. LAKE - DAY - 1999

               Lenny and Kayleigh, as teens, sit together with Evan at the 
               far end of the boat.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - 1999

               Evan looks on longingly as Lenny and Kayleigh become lovers 
               in high school.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT - 1999

               A campfire. Evan sips from a BEER CAP as Lenny and Kayleigh 
               make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval.

               BACK TO EVAN:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY - 2002

               Evan's in agony as Kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and 
               Lenny rushes Evan's wheelchair through. Kayleigh carries a 
               pair of prosthetic arms in her hands.

               Evan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump.

                                     EVAN
                         Where are we going?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         We have to get you to Sunnyvale. 
                         You're having one of your famous 
                         hemorrhages.

                                     EVAN
                         Stop! Take me back!

                                     LENNY
                         Sorry, tough guy, no can do. Your 
                         mother would kill me.

               Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of 
               the wheelchair. Lenny must halt in order not to crush Evan. 
               As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a 
               CROWD GATHERS.

               Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd 
               that titters and snickers in the background.

                                     EVAN
                         Take me back, Lenny!
                              (teeth clenched)
                         You owe me that much.

               Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         What are you geeks looking at? Must 
                         be nice to be so goddamned perfect, 
                         huh? Fucking losers.

               The crowd breaks up and leaves.

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY

               It's calm now. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair 
               around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms. Random PEOPLE 
               call out to Lenny. He's extremely popular in this world.

                                     LENNY
                         'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the 
                         party! Don't even think I'm giving 
                         you my lab notes either! Think I 
                         like getting up for "eight thirty's"?

               Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket. Their conversation 
               stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by. 
               Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent.

                                     LENNY
                         Hey, there's Tommy.

               Evan spins around in fear. He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and 
               handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus 
               Crusade for Christ." Tommy seems good-natured now, working 
               hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as Evan 
               rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan.

                                     TOMMY
                         I did what you said, man! We're 
                         pooling our student funds with Hillel 
                         House and we're going to have an 
                         Awareness Dance.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh goody, nothing like spinning my 
                         chair around to a techno mix of Hava 
                         Nagila til I puke.

               Tommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs 
               and nods back to him.

                                     LENNY
                         Uh, we should be getting to class 
                         now.

                                     EVAN
                         Forget it. What's the point of Psych 
                         now? Tomorrow I could wake up as 
                         some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

               Another exchanged glance. Kayleigh looks at Evan.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Let's go for a stroll.

               Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others. To 
               the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy.

               Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can "magically" 
               will to open, close, open, close...

                                     EVAN
                         So Tommy's really into this Jesus 
                         kick, huh?

               Kayleigh looks at him curiously.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You know how spiritual he's gotten 
                         ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and 
                         Katie.

                                     EVAN
                         He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the 
                         twisted fuck.

               Kayleigh, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually 
               uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a 
               granola bar and hands it to him.

               His prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She 
               seems more confused.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Is something the matter?

                                     EVAN
                              (re: prosthetic arms)
                         Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed 
                         or something.

               She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh? Do you ever think about 
                         "us?" I mean, wonder if it could 
                         ever have been different between the 
                         two of us?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Sure, Evan, why not? You were the 
                         first person I really ever cared 
                         about.

                                     EVAN
                         I was?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         That's why when I was little I never 
                         went to live with my mother.

                                     EVAN
                         I don't get it.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (feeding another bite)
                         When my folks split, they gave me 
                         and Tommy a choice who we wanted to 
                         live with. I couldn't stand my dad, 
                         but I knew if I moved to my mom's 
                         I'd never see you again.

                                     EVAN
                         I never knew that. So then you still 
                         sometimes think of us... together?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's crossed my mind from time to 
                         time.

                                     EVAN
                              (hopeful)
                         And...?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well a lot of things cross my mind. 
                         I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. 
                         I can play out the movie of our entire 
                         lives in under a second. Boom -- we 
                         fall in love -- get married -- two 
                         kids, your keen analytical insight 
                         matched to my generous nature -- 
                         kids grow old as do we, relatively 
                         stable relationships, matching burial 
                         plots, the whole bit. It took a lot 
                         longer to spit out than to imagine.

                                     EVAN
                         Then you think it might have worked 
                         out?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Why not? But that's not how things 
                         wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's 
                         your friend. And there it ends.

               She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically. 
               Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading 
               tone.

                                     EVAN
                         Would it make any difference if I 
                         told you that no one could possibly 
                         love anyone as much as I love you?

               Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan 
               turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on 
               Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny.

               Evan can't take his eyes off her.

               ANGLE ON

               Lenny kissing Kayleigh. In painful slo-mo. Evan turns away, 
               utterly heartbroken.

               INT. HANDICAPPED BATHROOM - DAY

               CLOSE UP

               Evan's stump turns on a BATHTUB FAUCET.

               REVEAL:

               Evan, fully clothed, lies in a bathtub that's filling with 
               water. Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over.

               The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils -- Evan makes 
               his peace and takes a final breath.

               And the water spills over the side of the tub. All Evan can 
               do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose.

               A beat. Then the door opens.

               TOMMY ENTERS. Immediately sizing up the situation.

                                     TOMMY
                         You forgot to put the toaster on the 
                         edge.

               Tommy casually turns off the water, then pops open the DRAIN. 
               The water level lowers to Evan's mouth.

                                     EVAN
                         But you, Kayleigh and Lenny like 
                         toast. And that's really all that 
                         matters now.

               Tommy feels Evan's anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor 
               by the tub. He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder.

               Evan bristles at first, but finally gives in to his hatred, 
               ultimately resting his own head against Tommy's. Taking the 
               comfort offered.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'll get you changed. Visiting hours 
                         are almost up.

               INT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL - EVENING

               Tommy rolls Evan through a quiet hospital corridor.

                                     EVAN
                              (looking around)
                         What, did mom get transferred again?

               Tommy frowns, confused, then rolls Evan into --

               INT. ANDREA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Evan is startled to see Andrea hooked up to several IV's, an 
               oxygen tank and a respirator. Several oxygen hoses connect 
               to a tracheotomy tube.

               Tommy smiles and kisses Andrea on the cheek. She tousles his 
               hair in return.

               Evan can hardly speak. As Tommy begins to wheel Evan's chair 
               closer to Andrea's bedside, Andrea utters a faint whisper.

                                     ANDREA
                         Looking. Good. Kiddo.

               Evan eyes her MEDICAL CLIPBOARD as he's wheeled by.

                                     EVAN
                              (reading)
                         Lung cancer?

                                     TOMMY
                         Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts 
                         lately.

               Andrea flinches to hear this. Evan stares at her, eyes wide.

                                     EVAN
                         Right... You started chain smoking 
                         after I blew myself up.

               Evan suddenly seems sick with guilt.

                                     EVAN
                         There must be a way to fix this.

                                     ANDREA
                         Fix?

                                     EVAN
                         I just need the entry about the 
                         blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I 
                         never even got the chance to write 
                         it.

               A flicker of recognition registers in her eyes.

                                     ANDREA
                         Is Evan... different?

                                     TOMMY
                         He's just going through some tough 
                         times.

                                     EVAN
                         Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.

                                     TOMMY
                         I think I'll go check out the chapel.

                                     ANDREA
                         You're. Acting. Like your father.

                                     EVAN
                         Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my 
                         age when he started going crazy 
                         doesn't mean that I'm nuts.

               Andrea is shocked.

                                     ANDREA
                         How. Did you. Know that?

                                     EVAN
                         You told me that on Parents' Weekend. 
                         Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or 
                         you.

               She uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen 
               tube and forces herself to speak in a sick, GRAVELY manner.

                                     ANDREA
                         Just. Like. Jason.

                                     EVAN
                         Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out 
                         of here.

               He pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself 
               out of the room.

               Andrea forces her loudest raspy scream.

                                     ANDREA
                         Stop him. Stop him. Stop him...

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Lenny tears through old cardboard boxes in Evan's closet. 
               Evan watches nearby.

                                     LENNY
                         Are you sure you even packed it?

                                     EVAN
                         My mom packed for me. I think she 
                         sent everything I ever owned. So 
                         we'll see.

               Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk 
               on the floor. Old report cards, books, toys and photo albums 
               fall on the floor.

                                     LENNY
                         Is this it?

               Evan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal. AGE 
               7.

                                     LENNY
                         What do you need it for? I don't get 
                         you lately.

                                     EVAN
                         Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you 
                         for one last favor.

                                     LENNY
                         What?

                                     EVAN
                         Shhh. I need to concentrate on the 
                         blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.

                                     LENNY
                              (concerned)
                         Destroy it?

                                     EVAN
                         If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom 
                         never woulda started smoking in the 
                         first place. Now shhhh.

               Lenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches 
               Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat.

               ON EVAN

               As new sounds ECHO BACKWARD. There's a --

               SHIMMER!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING - 1989

               Evan comes to in his childhood kitchen. He is only seven 
               years old. He coughs up Lucky Charms that have "magically" 
               appeared in his mouth. On a journal before him is the recently 
               written passage:

               JOURNAL ENTRY

               "Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy. I 
               will mete there father and see what a real dad is like."

               Andrea is nowhere in sight. Evan springs to his feet and 
               flexes his real hands triumphantly.

                                     EVAN
                         Yes. Now how do I destroy the 
                         blockbuster?

               He rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large 
               butcher knife and grabs it. He tucks it into his sock but it 
               won't fit. He's still debating what to do when:

               ANDREA WALKS IN and is startled by the unexpected sight of 
               Evan holding a huge knife.

               Evan sees her but remains expressionless. Andrea's face 
               blanches.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan? What are you doing with that 
                         knife?

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002

               Evan comes to to find Lenny still staring at him. Waiting 
               for something big to happen.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, that didn't work...

               Evan flips a single page of his journal and tries again. He 
               reads to himself, then relaxes his head --

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. MILLER'S BASEMENT - DAY - 1989

               Evan, seven again, stands in the basement dressed in his 
               Robin Hood costume as Mr. Miller prepares for the sex scene.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Now in this part of the story, Robin 
                         Hood just married Maid Marian and 
                         they have to kiss and stuff like 
                         grown-ups do.

               Kayleigh giggles. There seems to be a new glint of 
               intelligence in Evan's eyes as he adjusts to his new 
               surroundings.

                                     EVAN
                         Wait! I need my belt!

               Mr. Miller is puzzled, but watches Evan SKIP to the fireplace.

                                     EVAN
                              (overly childlike)
                         Loo loo, skip to my loo. Loo loo, 
                         skip to my loo.

               Mr. Miller puts his eye back to the viewfinder as Evan quickly 
               finds Mr. Miller's old army thermos in the bottom drawer of 
               the dresser, opens it and shakes out the blockbuster.

                                     EVAN
                         Loo, loo, skip to my loo.

               He tries to crack it with his own hands, but his seven-year 
               old body is too weak.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Hey kid, don't bother with the belt.

               Mr. Miller finally turns around and sees Evan banging the 
               blockbuster on the table. Shock registers in Mr. Miller's 
               eyes and he takes a step towards Evan.

                                     EVAN
                         Back off, fuckbag!

               Mr. Miller freezes on that, and Evan smiles at him.

                                     EVAN
                         Amazing. That word never fails to 
                         make an impression with you...

               Mr. Miller takes a slow, non-threatening step toward Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad 
                         boy or I'll tell mommy you were 
                         naughty.

                                     EVAN
                         And I'll tell the Child Protective 
                         Services about your kiddie porn 
                         endeavors. One step closer and I'll 
                         shove this up your ass!

               Kayleigh's mouth hangs open with utter amazement at the scene. 
               Tommy, hiding at the top of the stairs, slowly creeps down 
               to get a better view.

               Evan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden "strike 
               anywhere" matches used at thirteen to light his cigarettes.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         That's dangerous! You could blow 
                         your hands off!

                                     EVAN
                         Been there, done that.

               Evan, standing near the fireplace, defiantly strikes the 
               match with this thumb and lowers the flame to the short fuse.

               Mr. Miller charges Evan just as the fuse is lit! Mr. Miller 
               knocks the blockbuster from Evan's hand and it rolls towards 
               the other side of the room, resting peacefully against the 
               video camera.

               Kayleigh's eyes are dazzled by the sparkling fuse and she 
               bends down to pick it up --

                                     MR. MILLER/TOMMY/EVAN
                         Kayleigh! NOOOOOooooo!

               EXT. MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY - 1989

               BOOM! The blast is deafening.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SUNNYVALE - EVAN'S ROOM - DAY - 2002

               Evan, twenty, wakes up with a bloody nose.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh God, Kayleigh...

               Evan gets a new series of QUICK IMAGES and FLASHED FACES.

               INT. FAMILY COURTROOM - DAY - 1989

               Evan (now seven) is institutionalized before a judge.

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY - 1989-1994

               Evan (seven through twelve) GROWS UP in an institution.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY - 1989-1994

               Evan undergoes years of therapy under Redfield's care.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S ROOM - SUNNYVALE - DAY - 2002

               Evan lies in a room, same posters from college adorn the 
               walls. Blood flows freely now.

                                     EVAN
                              (sobbing uncontrollably)
                         Kayleigh... no! You can't die again! 
                         I won't let this happen. I won't!

               Evan fights off the pain and looks under his bed for 
               something.

                                     EVAN
                         Where are they?!

               His journals are missing! He runs from the room.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFCIE - DAY

               Evan runs into Dr. Redfield's office just as another patient 
               is leaving.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We 
                         don't meet for another hour.

                                     EVAN
                         Where are my goddamn books?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Books?

                                     EVAN
                         My journals! Where are they?

               The doctor looks heartbroken, as if Evan has had a relapse.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It kills me to have to go through 
                         this again. There are no journals. 
                         There never were. It's part of this 
                         fantasy world your mind created to 
                         cope with the guilt of killing...

               Evan looks stunned. Refusing to believe it.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Think Evan. You've invented a disease 
                         that doesn't exist. Alternate 
                         universes with colleges, prisons, 
                         paraplegia...

                                     EVAN
                         But I... I need those books.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         You remind me of your father. He 
                         always screamed for a photo album 
                         even though he never had one.

                                     EVAN
                         Photos?

               Evan's eyes roll back and he collapses lifelessly to the 
               floor.

               INT. SUNNYVALE LABORATORY - DAY

               Evan lies on a platform and gets another series of CAT-scans.

               INT. EVAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Evan, no longer incapacitated, stares out the window into 
               the darkness. Alone.

               Trapped. Hopeless.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Later that day, Dr. Redfield posts the new CAT-scan slides 
               on the light box and shudders when he sees the results. Andrea 
               looks on anxiously.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Jesus, no.

               Andrea, biting her nails, is unable to conceal her fear.

                                     ANDREA
                         No dances, just tell me.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                              (devastated)
                         The hemorrhaging... the neural damage 
                         is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised 
                         he still has use of his motor 
                         functions.

               Andrea begins to break down in tears. Evan secretly listens 
               in from the hallway.

               His gaunt face looks deep in thought. He takes a breath and 
               enters the lab, making sure not to look directly at his 
               weeping mother.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, Mom, didja remember to bring 
                         those goofy old home movies we used 
                         to make?

               Andrea wipes tears away, nodding in advance.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Evan sees no one is watching him in the institution corridor 
               as he throws his weight into the door of the doctor's office, 
               breaking it open.

               Sporadically, severe VIBRATIONS invade Evan's environment, 
               threatening to distract him from his mission.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Evan enters the office and tears the file cabinets apart, 
               looking for something.

               His nose bleeds profusely and he repeatedly wipes the blood 
               off his face with irritation.

               Evan sees a cardboard marked TREBORN, E. Grabs it and hides 
               under the doctor's desk.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting 
               for him. An ALARM SOUNDS. GUARDS are shouting.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Evan, under the doctor's desk, grabs some paper and begins 
               writing in shorthand.

                                     EVAN
                         If anyone finds this, then I guess 
                         my plan didn't work and I'm already 
                         dead.

               Again, the world flutters as if it were attached to a paint-
               shaker. He takes a deep breath.

                                     EVAN
                         But I -- I can just go back to the 
                         beginning of all this, I might be 
                         able to save her.

               Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               Dr. Redfield catches up with the rest of the guards.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         He's not in his room. Search the 
                         grounds.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               The cardboard box is overturned. Evan finishes threading a 
               SUPER-8 film projector and turns it on. Careful not to let 
               any light spill against the wall, Evan projects it at the 
               underside of the desk.

               We see familiar home movie footage from his childhood: Lenny, 
               5, has a birthday party. Kayleigh is there.

               ANGLE ON EVAN'S EYES

               Getting lost in the memory.

               CHAOTIC NOISES of CHILDREN'S PARTY bleed into Evan's reality. 
               The world SHUDDERS UNCONTROLLABLY.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. LENNY'S BACKYARD - DAY - 1987

               Evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party. He's unexpectedly 
               gently prodded forward by Andrea.

                                     ANDREA
                         Go on, Evan. Introduce yourself.

               Evan slowly approaches Kayleigh, only five. She smiles 
               bashfully at him. An old memory comes back to him.

                                     KAYLEIGH (V.O.)
                         When my folks split, they gave me 
                         and Tommy a choice who we wanted to 
                         live with. I couldn't stand my dad, 
                         but I knew if I lived with my mom, 
                         I'd never see you again...

               Evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of 
               this distant memory.

               He even inhales the aroma of the place. Savoring the moment. 
               He locks eyes with Kayleigh.

                                     ANDREA (O.S.)
                         He's not usually this shy.

               It's time. Evan leans over to Kayleigh as if he's about to 
               kiss her. Then whispers in her ear:

                                     EVAN
                         I hate you. If you ever come near me 
                         again, I'll kill you and your whole 
                         family.

               Kayleigh reacts predictably. Bursting into tears and runs 
               into Kayleigh's mother's arms.

                                     KAYLEIGH'S MOTHER
                         What did you say to her? What 
                         happened?!

               Evan ignores them. He can't take his eyes off Kayleigh.

                                     EVAN
                         Goodbye.

               His eyes well up.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan wakes up with a bloody nose. He grabs a pillow and covers 
               his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him.

               Lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award-winning 
               flatworms project and hands it to Evan.

                                     LENNY (O.S.)
                         You alright? Should I call the doctor?

               Evan groans and shakes his head "no". He rides out the pain 
               like a seasoned pro.

               When it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles 
               feebly.

                                     EVAN
                         I'll think I'll be alright this time.
                              (a new hope)
                         I really do.

               Lenny nods, still concerned.

               INT. COLLEGE - INCINERATOR ROOM - LATER

               Evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace. 
               He and Lenny carry cardboard boxes.

                                     LENNY
                         You sure about this?

               Evan nods. They silently dump tons of journals into the fire. 
               Evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies, 
               photo albums, old report cards, etc. In they go.

               CLOSE ON

               Burning journals.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY - 2010

               Evan, a suit now, walks down a city street cradling a cell 
               phone to his ear.

               TITLE CARD: YEARS LATER

                                     EVAN
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, Ma. I'm running a little late 
                         for lunch. One of my patients had a 
                         breakdown. Anyway, order some soup 
                         in the meantime. See ya soon.

               As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit 
               approaches from the other direction. Evan has to look closely, 
               but it's Kayleigh. A mature woman, now.

               He stumbles slightly, caught off guard. As she passes, her 
               eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's 
               no recognition. Evan watches her continue past him and down 
               the sidewalk.

               After a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and 
               follows her.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               Roll credits...

                                         THE END

   CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S LEG

   A nervous leg shakes under the table. The appendage seems
   to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind.


   INT. CAFE-DAY

   LOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a
   friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost
   villainous in how collective he is.

   He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the
   cause for his anxious state.

                        LOUIS
                 (smug)
          Something is bothering you...

   We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is
   obviously uneasy about being out in public with this
   person.

                       QUINN
          I appreciate the faux concern but I'm
          fine.

   Louis is taken aback.

                       LOUIS
          My concern is genuine...

                       QUINN
          With our history can you honestly say you
          care about my well being?

                       LOUIS
          Yes I can, our connection is a product of
          destiny. I have no ill-will against you.

   Quinn scoffs.

                       LOUIS
          -The Stephen Speilberg film?

                       QUINN
          No, there was that little French girl I
          liked. You..you violated her and torched
          her farm killing her family-
                                                      2.


                       LOUIS
          -Actually you are jacking up the story, I
          violated her father in front of
          her...then I torched the farm.

                       QUINN
          Well...that makes it ten times better.

                       LOUIS
          Quinn that was war, people do crazy
          things midst of wide spread conflict. I
          have gotten jaded over time. It's not
          like the dark ages when I had style.

                       QUINN
          When you would rape the horses and ride
          away on the women?

                       LOUIS
          Yeah I was such a ham.
          (beat)
          Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten
          carried away in the past, but now I'm
          tired. I just want to get this over with.
          It's our calling, we help bring order and
          balance to the universe.
           (beat)
          Maybe I would feel less removed if you
          would let me win just once.

                       QUINN
          This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I
          take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of
          some bookie...I'm bringing on the
          apocalypse.
Louis takes a drink of his coffee.

                       LOUIS
          See at least our obligation would be
          over.

                       QUINN
          Louis I might be nervous, but I accept my
          role as savior of this world.
          (beat)
          We have been doing this for years-

                        LOUIS
          -centuries-

                       QUINN
          -and in 5 days we will do the same thing
          we have always done.
                       (MORE)
                                                       3.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          (beat)
          We'll fight to the death.

INT. CAFE-DAY-MOMENTS LATER

We pan across the cafe to the table of ZOEY and RICK, a
young college aged couple. Zoey is obviously trying to
have a serious conversation, while Rick hides behind his
laptop using it as a shield.

                       ZOEY
          ...I'm not saying this is an
          intervention.

Rick doesn't look up from his laptop screen.

                       RICK
          Wouldn't there be more people here if it
          was an intervention?

                       ZOEY
          See and I don't want it to be-

                       RICK
          (disinterested)
          -That's because it's not

                       ZOEY
          It's just...I mean...are you gambling
          again?
                       RICK
          (totally removed)
           Nope.

                       ZOEY
          Because...um...the laptop, and you never
          go anywhere with out it-

                       RICK
          -it's my lifeline-

                       ZOEY
          -Yeah well...I just know when I met you I
          saved you from that downhill spiral...you
          know...uh...the online poker-
                                                      4.


                       RICK
          -I'm not a project, you know that right?

                       ZOEY
          Of course not...I never said you were.

                       RICK
          Because you act like it...I wonder if I
          didn't have this "so called problem" if
          you would have even been interested in
          me.

                       ZOEY
          Of course I would. I just-

                       RICK
          -Take it upon yourself to save people.

                       ZOEY
          OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each
          other, who else is going to do it.

                       RICK
          (continued to be removed)
          People could just save themselves.

                       ZOEY
          True. Is that human nature? People rely
          on false deities, self help books...Rick
          the day I realized we were alone in the
          universe was the day I realized we have
          to be there for each other.
          (beat)
          Plus don't you find it romantic that I
          want to save you? Like a movie...

                       RICK
          So our relationship is like a romantic
          comedy?

                       ZOEY
          (dreamy)
          A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.

                       RICK
          Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm
          doing on the computer?

Zoey feels like she has broken down the "wall".

                       ZOEY
          Yes...of course!
                                                      5.


Rick spins the computer around.

                       RICK
          Check that out Lloyd Dobler.

                       ZOEY
          (Shocked)
           Is that...porn?

                       RICK
          Red Tube...like You Tube...but with porn.

                       ZOEY
          Um....
          (lightbulb)
           wait...is that?

                       RICK
          Oh yes...

                       ZOEY
          Us having sex?

                       RICK
          Oh yeah...

Rick reaches over and points at the laptop screen.

                       RICK (CONT'D)
          I love the part coming up.
           (beat)
          You know where I put your legs behind
          your head and yell "hump bunny!"

                       ZOEY
          Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this...
                       RICK
          Yeah...OK...I'm also breaking up with
          you.

                       ZOEY
          What?-

                       RICK
          -Yeah not working any more for me-

                       ZOEY
          What the hell?!? How is it not working?!?

                       RICK
          You are yelling...you know I don't like
          confrontational situations.
                                                          6.


                       ZOEY
          I'm not trying to be confrontational...I
          just...you are breaking up with me?

                       RICK
          -Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now?

Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward
Rick.

                       RICK (CONT'D)
          (looking at the screen)
           This part is fucking priceless.

Zoey is bewildered.


EXT. PARK-AFTERNOON

Louis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching
for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree
limb.

He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right
hand.

                       LOUIS
          This will do.

He throws it over to Quinn, who catches it in one swift
move.

                       QUINN
          So what are you wanting to do?

Louis searches around for a stick of his own.
                       LOUIS
          I figure we would train...

                       QUINN
          Why?

Louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb
into attack position.

                       LOUIS
          Because you dominate me every time-
          (beat)
          -ohh that sounded dirty

                       QUINN
          So you want me to help you get an
          advantage?
                                                       7.


                       LOUIS
          No, I want you to help me put on a good
          show. Everyone loves a good climax Quinn.


PARK-RIVERSIDE-CONTINUOUS

Zoey sits on a bench beside her best friend ANNA. Zoey is
completely distant, as Anna's words pass through her into
thin air.

                       ANNA
          You know I don't like interjecting myself
          into other people's affairs but-

                       ZOEY
          (barley paying attention)
          -But you're going to

                       ANNA
          You let Rick do this to you.

                       ZOEY
          (Snapping to it)
           How so?

                       ANNA
          You think you can change the men you are
          with. You can't get into a relationship
          with someone in the hopes that you can
          mold them into the person you want them
          to be.

                       ZOEY
          Rick needed someone stable-
                       ANNA
          -Rick needs castrated.

                       ZOEY
          That's slightly strong.

                       ANNA
          He was an asshole.

                       ZOEY
          Misunderstood-

                       ANNA
          -OK I'll meet you half
          way...misunderstood asshole.
           (beat)
          You have been repeating the same cycle
          your whole entire life.
                                                          8.


                         ZOEY
            Now that's a little off base.

                                                     CUT TO:


ANIMATED SEQUENCE

FLASHBACK

ZOEY 10 YEARS OLD

A young BOY is sitting on another little boy's head. It
looks like he is passing gas on him.

                         ANNA (V.O.)
            Remember Billy, who used to give kids the
            "dirty bomb"? You took it upon yourself
            to change this behavior-

The boy is now doing the same to Zoey.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            -This put you right in the cross-hairs to
            be his next victim.

ZOEY 13 YEARS OLD

ZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street
corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well
as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if
South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug
            dealer-
Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            -You took it upon yourself to be his
            personal savoir. What did it get you?

Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS
show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to
show he doesn't have any dough on him.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Well when Zach's old business partners
            wanted to collect on a debt-

Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them.
                                                          9.


A few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee
table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine.

                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          - they used you to replace their missing
          coffee table they broke during a drunken
          party.

ZOEY 17 YEARS OLD.

A gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles
showing his golden grille.

                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          -And then you have Toothpick. What kind
          of name is Toothpick?

                       ZOEY (V.O.)
          It was his gang name.

                       ANNA (V.O.)
          Of course.

It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux. He
takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          We won't talk about prom night. Needless
          to say it wasn't romantic.

Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is
standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It
appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with
the black censor bar.

                                                    BACK TO:


PARK-RIVERSIDE-PRESENT DAY

                       ZOEY
          Exaggerations-

                       ANNA
          -Accurate account of events... The story
          of your romantic life-

                       ZOEY
          -Unfair. Because these people need
          someone who is going to sacrifice their
          own needs for them.
                                                      10.


                       ANNA
          Why?

                       ZOEY
          Who else is going to do it? We're alone
          in the universe. If we are going to make
          it through this "crazy world" we need to
          look out for each other.

                       ANNA
          I think you use atheism and the whole "we
          are alone in the universe" jive to
          justify your actions.
          (beat)
          I regret taking you to see Dawkins
          because you use that as a fall back to be
          codependent.

                       ZOEY
          First of all you are bitter about the
          whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed
          him your tits and got us kicked out-

                       ANNA
          -You didn't even know the first thing
          about "The God Delusion" until I gave you
          a copy-

                       ZOEY
          -And someone who was huge supporter turns
          her back because Richard Dawkins didn't
          like her nipple piercing-

                       ANNA
          (playful banter)
          -Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer-
                       ZOEY
          (more banter)
          -Enjoy your delusional life there fence
          sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit
          me with a lighting bolt so I can be
          removed from this asinine conversation.

                       ANNA
          You're hiding behind this religious
          debate because you don't want to admit
          you have always gravitated toward the
          "wrong type" of guy.

Zoey is staring off into space.
                                                        11.


                       ZOEY
          (detached)
          I actually stopped listening to you.

                       ANNA
          What are you staring at?

Zoey points at Quinn and Louis, who are fighting with
tree limbs in the distance.

                       ZOEY
          Who are those guys?

                       ANNA
          The one closest to us is Quinn. Very
          weird, socially awkward type of guy. I
          don't know who his friend is.

                       ZOEY
          What are they doing?

                       ANNA
          I don't know. Looks like that stuff my ex-
          Rob was into-

                       ZOEY
          Oh that medieval rugby style game-

                       ANNA
          -Yeah the made up sport from "Blood Of
          Heroes"...Oh...Jugger!-

                       ZOEY
          -Sounds pornographic.
           (beat)
          So Quinn? What else do you know about
          him?

                       ANNA
          Oh no you don't! This is exactly what I
          was talking about!

Anna senses something in Zoey that she is trying to hide.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          Wait a second? You've already established
          contact with Quinn?

                       ZOEY
          What is this MI-6?

                       ANNA
          You have your sights on him already!
                                                         12.


                       ZOEY
          No, I'm just curious.

                       ANNA
          What happened?

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

TITLE CARD: 2 HOURS AGO


PARK-RIVERSIDE-EARLIER

Zoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down
to the riverside. She is holding something tight in her
hand.

CLOSE UP-HAND

As her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm.
It appears this might have belonged to Rick.


PARK-RIVERSIDE

Still teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the
river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it
slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench.

Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the
first time.

                       ZOEY
          (making her way to the bench)
          I'm so sorry
Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up
the ring.

                       QUINN
          (handing the ring back to her)
          Is this yours?

She takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket.

                       ZOEY
          Kinda... Again I'm so sorry.

                       QUINN
          No need to apologize.

Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit.
                                                      13.


                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          Do you want to sit?

                         ZOEY
          (unsure)
           OK?

Zoey sits, still apprehensive.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          (reaching her hand out)
           I'm Zoey.

                       QUINN
          (He returns the gesture)
           Quinn.
          (beat)
          Zoey? Interesting.

                       ZOEY
          Oh name? Yes, most people have
          interesting stories behind their
          names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure
          why my parents did that.

                         QUINN
          Very unique.

                       ZOEY
          (smiles)
          I suppose that's a compliment. So I've
          seen you around school, but never
          really...in...class...

                       QUINN
          I don't go to Marshall, I live near the
          campus though.

                       ZOEY
          Oh, well so what do you do?

                       QUINN
          As in profession? I don't really have
          one.

                       ZOEY
          Really? Rent is insane around here...

                       QUINN
          Yeah, my father provides for me.

                       ZOEY
          That's pretty cool. What's he into?
                                           14.


              QUINN
Everything.

             ZOEY
An entrepreneur...That's awesome.
(beat)
Well...So do you like coming down here?

             QUINN
To the river?

             ZOEY
(smiles)
Yes where we are right now.

             QUINN
I just needed to think.

             ZOEY
Yeah me too. I just suffered a break up.

             QUINN
My apologies.

             ZOEY
No it's OK. I mean I'm over it.

             QUINN
(laughs)
My head disagrees.

              ZOEY
I'm sorry.

             QUINN
It's really OK.
             ZOEY
So what did you need to think about? I
mean if I'm not prying of course.

             QUINN
No, I just have some problems.
(beat)
I'm not sure about my calling in life.

             ZOEY
I'm not sure anyone is. You know if you
need a friend, I'd be glad to...well you
know...listen.

             QUINN
I'd appreciate that. I don't have many
friends.
                                                         15.


                       ZOEY
          I know.
          (trying to double back)
          I mean...I've seen you around
          campus...you seem like a loner...I didn't
          mean you were a loser. Loner is kind of
          sexy, loser...well can kind of be
          too...I'll stop.

                       QUINN
          No, it's OK. I agree it never hurts to
          have a friend.

                       ZOEY
          So we can maybe go out to dinner if you
          want?

                       QUINN
          OK...

                       ZOEY
          And I can pay, you know..make up for the
          head...

                       QUINN
          You really don't have to.

                       ZOEY
          No I want to.

                       QUINN
          OK.

                       ZOEY
          Well...
          (beat)
          Good let's meet up tonight. My place,
          7pm.

TITLE CARD: 7PM


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-7PM

JACK, A 20 year old gay man who loves him a good "Cosby
Sweater", is sitting at the computer desk "surfing" on
the desktop.

Anna walks up from behind and runs her fingers through
Jack's hair.
                                                         16.


                       JACK
          So when does Ted Bundy get here?

We follow Anna across the room where she plops herself
down on the couch.

                       ANNA
          I promised her we would behave.

A KNOCK is heard at the front door.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          Although knocking right as I sat down
          doesn't endear him to me...

Jack gets up from the desk.

                       JACK
          You sit your pretty little ass down
          hooker.


Anna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch.

                       ANNA
          This is why I don't need a boyfriend. You
          are way to good to me.

Jack opens the door to reveal Quinn.

                       JACK
          Look at this mother fucker.

He rudely motions him to come in and sit down.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for
          a night of manipulation, sit the fuck
          down.

                       QUINN
          (confused)
          Um...OK?

In almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn, is he being rude?

                       QUINN
          (looking at Jack)
          No quite pleasant.

Zoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch.
                                                        17.


                        ZOEY
          Let's go.

                       JACK
          (looking at Quinn)
          I will call the state police in a fucking
          heart beat if she isn't here by midnight.

                       QUINN
          (still confused)
          OK?

Anna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation.

                       ZOEY
          Anna, you going to call the guard dog
          off?

                       ANNA
          (out of it)
          David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight.
          I'm relaxing and not getting in the
          middle.

                       QUINN
          (To Jack and Anna)
          Nice meeting both of you.

                       JACK
          Get the fuck out.

                       ZOEY
          (to Jack and Anna)
          Don't wait up

Zoey and Quinn leave the apartment as Jack stares
daggers.


EXT. APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop Quinn.

                       ZOEY
          Sorry about Jack...

                        QUINN
          I like him.
                                                      18.


INT. RESTAURANT-MOMENTS LATER

Zoey and Quinn are enjoying their meal at this fancy
upscale establishment. Quinn picks up his menu, running
his finger down though the menu items.

                       QUINN
          Zoey I would be more than happy to pay.

                       ZOEY
          No not at all. This is on me.

                       QUINN
          I can cover dessert at least.

                       ZOEY
          Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist-

                       QUINN
          -So you don't want dessert?-

                       ZOEY
          -No, I just wanted to get it out of the
          way. It bothers people, I mean in this
          state especially.

Quinn puts down the menu.

                       QUINN
          It doesn't bother me.

                        ZOEY
          Really?

                       QUINN
          I don't believe anyone is truly an
          atheist at the end.

                       ZOEY
          I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist.

                        QUINN
          Why's that?

                       ZOEY
          Because I'm a logical thinker.
          (beat)
          I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing
          you're religious.

                       QUINN
          One supports the business they are in I
          guess.
                                           19.


             ZOEY
Oh my God you are in the ministry.

              QUINN
(smiles)
Kind of.

             ZOEY
My father was a "fire and damnation"
preacher. Baptist...He's...

              QUINN
He's?

             ZOEY
It's nothing.
(beat)
Sorry I don't mean to rock your world.

              QUINN
(smiles)
You didn't.

             ZOEY
You poor thing. You are probably so
desperate for friends-

              QUINN
(laughs)
What?

             ZOEY
Have you thought about St John's Wort?

             QUINN
You are a very cryptic speaker.
             ZOEY
No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was
just...well...you have some social
awkwardness.

              QUINN
OK?

             ZOEY
Well you are latching on to religion to
make you feel whole. It doesn't make you
feel whole, or at least as whole as you
thought it would-

             QUINN
You are kind of right on that one.
                                                       20.


                        ZOEY
           So you are out with me...I represent
           everything you were brought up to combat.
           You're missing something and you are
           looking for help.

                        QUINN
           I am looking for help. I'm out with you
           though because I'm interested in getting
           to know you.

                        ZOEY
           (smiles)
           See I'm good at reading people.

                        QUINN
           (rolls eyes, smiles)
            Kind of.

                        ZOEY
           I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost
           soul. I thought that when I saw you by
           the river.

                        QUINN
           You like lost souls don't you?

                        ZOEY
           Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save
           them.

                        QUINN
           You going to save me?

                        ZOEY
           If you let me.
                        QUINN
           I think you might be able to.

                        ZOEY
           (endearing smile)
           So what do you need Quinn?

                        QUINN
           (smiles)
           Dessert.


INT.   ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER

Jack is passed out drooling on the couch. Anna and Zoey
are cross legged on the floor in the midst of "girl
talk".
                                                         21.


                       ANNA
          I don't know, he seems fishy.

                       ZOEY
          He seems harmless.

                       ANNA
          I have heard that a million times.

                       ZOEY
          I know. He's in the ministry-

                       ANNA
          -and you hate organized religion.

                       ZOEY
          I know and he's understanding of that.

                       ANNA
          Plus it's to my understanding he didn't
          actually admit what he did. He just did a
          bunch of double talk.

                       ZOEY
          It was understood.

                       ANNA
          Yeah again...not feeling confident in
          your choices. Please Zoey...
          (beat)...
          Be careful this time.

TITLE CARD: 4 DAYS LEFT


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-DAY
Quinn is sleeping in his bed. His room is rather bare,
with the exception of the basic living necessities. It
almost appears like a room at the "Y".

CLOSE UP-EDGE OF BED

A foot is seen kicking the bed, startling Quinn.


QUINN'S ROOM

Quinn flies out of bed and sees Louis leaning against the
wall with his arms crossed.

                       LOUIS
          Where were you last night?
                                                         22.


                       QUINN
          (getting his bearings)
          Out...thinking.

                       LOUIS
          You've done a lot of mopping and thinking
          over the centuries. It kind of brings me
          down.

                       QUINN
          So what do you need?

                          LOUIS
          Training.


EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Louis and Quinn walk out into a huge open field. Louis is
carrying a black tote bag that he drops on the ground.

                       LOUIS
          Now this is a place for a climatic
          battle.

                          QUINN
          Not bad.

Quinn points at the bag

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          What's in the bag?

                       LOUIS
          You will love this.
Louis goes to the tote bag and starts to unzip it.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I went to the toy store last night and
          picked these up.

He reaches into the bag and pulls out two "nurf" style
swords out.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Nothing like our real stuff, but it will
          do.

Louis throws one of the "swords" to Quinn.

                       QUINN
          (catching it)
          It's kind of lightweight..and silly.
                                                         23.


Louis comes over carrying his sword.

                       LOUIS
          Come on give it a chance.

Louis comes at Quinn and his instinct kicks in. The two
begin their mock battle.


TREE

From behind a tree we see RYAN BLOOD for the first time.
He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital
camera.

Quinn and Louis continue to practice unaware of the
unwanted attention.


INT. CAFE-DAY

Louis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the
front window. It almost as if he is searching for
something.

                       LOUIS
          You have not been lively at all this go
          around.

                       QUINN
          A lot on my mind...

                       LOUIS
          We only do this once every seventy years
          brother. You have to enjoy it while it
          lasts.
                       QUINN
          Louis our whole purpose here, is to show
          up, and over time establish a social
          base, and then kill each other.

                       LOUIS
          You know and I'm very good at the social
          base part, and you are not so good...

                       QUINN
          That's because you find a way to screw it
          up every time.

                       LOUIS
          That's because, I know this is news to
          you, I represent evil.
                       (MORE)
                                                        24.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Here's the thing though, I'm tired Quinn.
          I really want to stop being the
          ambassador for this.

                       QUINN
          That's something we agree on. I'm tired
          too.

                       LOUIS
          I don't know if we can get off this
          train. It's just a viscous cycle.

                       QUINN
          Letting you win is not an option.

                       LOUIS
          I wasn't going there...
          (beat)
          ...yet.


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EVENING

Quinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their
way for the door.

                       ZOEY (O.S.)
          You guys leaving?

Zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn.

                       JACK
          Yeah we don't want to interrupt your
          "date rape".

Anna hits Jack.
                       ANNA
          Jesus Jack! He can't do anything here
          anyway. Too much exposure. Witnesses my
          friend...We knew he was here.

Zoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn.

                       ZOEY
          Will you guys stop??

                       QUINN
          It's OK. I like your friends.

Anna walks over to the couch.

                       ANNA
          So Quinn?
                                                        25.


                        QUINN
          Yes?

                       ANNA
          Zoey says you are in the ministry?

                        QUINN
          Sort of.

                       ANNA
          You are or you aren't.

                       QUINN
          It's complicated.

                       ANNA
          At some point you will have to explain it
          to Zoey. I mean don't you agree?

                        QUINN
          Well...

                       ZOEY
          (put out)
           Will you guys leave??

Jack grabs Anna by the arm and leads her to the door.

                       JACK
          Who is going too far now?

                        ANNA
          "Date Rape"

                       ZOEY
          (trying to make a point)
          Bye guys!

Anna and Jack mumble as they head out the door.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          (turning to Quinn)
          Sorry about that.

                       QUINN
          It's really OK.


EXT. APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Jack puts his arm around Anna, as to stop her for a
second.
                                                         26.


                       JACK
          You know I hate him because it's my
          nature but-

                       ANNA
          -You think I hate him because of my
          distrust of men?

                       JACK
          Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey
          in one way...you in another.

                       ANNA
          Yeah
          (beat,smiles)
          I became a "fag hag"

                                                    BACK TO:


INT.ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Zoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch. A popcorn
bowl is squeezed in between them. She reaches over and
picks up the remote.

                       ZOEY
          Tonight's Feature Presentation is "I am
          Curious:Yellow". Probably not the best
          date movie, but I always show this to
          ever guy in the beginning.

                       QUINN
          It's OK this will be my first film
          experience.
                        ZOEY
          What??

                       QUINN
          Yeah, I've never seen a film before. I
          mean I know of films, can't live in this
          world and not. I've just never seen one.

                       ZOEY
          This might be a little hard-core for your
          first film.

                       QUINN
          No it's OK. I'm excited.

Zoey shakes her head.
                                                        27.


                       ZOEY
          I feel like I'm stealing your virginity
          here.

Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          You're a virgin too aren't you?

Quinn shrugs

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          Oh my god! I'm a bad girl.

Quinn puts his hand on her shoulder.

                          QUINN
          (smiles)
          You are not.

Quinn motions to the TV.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          Please play the film.

                       ZOEY
          (hesitant)
          OK? I mean I usually play this for
          potential boyfriends. If they can handle
          this, they can handle me.

Zoey hits play on the remote.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          I guess you're lucky I thought about
          "They Call Her One Eye".
          (to herself)
          I hope this doesn't jack you up.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 3 DAYS LEFT


EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field.
He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance.

                       QUINN
          (monotone)
          I am curious Yellow...

Louis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap.
                                                      28.


                       LOUIS
          What the hell are you talking about?

Quinn stands up and grabs the sword.

                       QUINN
          Nothing really.

The two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his
heart in it.

                       LOUIS
          You half asleep Quinn?

Quinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his
side. Louis pokes Quinn in the chest with the tip of his
sword.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Look at that ladies and gentleman the
          apocalypse has begun.

Quinn sits down.

                       QUINN
          Have you ever seen a movie?

Louis follows his lead.

                       LOUIS
          I've seen plenty of movies.

                          QUINN
          Really?

                       LOUIS
          Yeah I watched "The Sorrow and The Pity"
          at Marshal the other day. You know people
          here have yet to figure out we are not
          students.

                       QUINN
          I think they have a pretty good idea.

                       LOUIS
          So in all the times we have been here,
          you haven't gone to the cinema?

                          QUINN
          No...

                          LOUIS
          Why not?
                                                         29.


                       QUINN
          It's not what we are here to do.

                       LOUIS
          In your bosses name, what is wrong with
          you? You've got to enjoy yourself. You
          might be chosen, but you have needs. We
          all do.

                       QUINN
          I have to stay focused.

                       LOUIS
          You've also burned yourself out. You're
          not going to be any good to me...

Louis gets up and reaches out to help Quinn

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          ...unless you take some "you" time.

Quinn takes Louis' hand and gets to his feet.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Can we get back to the matter at hand?

Louis brings his sword back up into attack position.
Quinn is back to his "swashbuckling" self. The two battle
it out on the field, matching each other blow for blow.


INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On
closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of
Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.

INT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's. It's obvious
he indulges just a little too much.

Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his
waist. He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself.

He walks back off screen to the bedroom. We still hear
him singing, as we pan around the apartment.

We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom.
He finally comes out fully dressed. He uses the towel he
was wearing to finish drying his hair.

He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself.
                                                         30.


LOUIS' POV

He starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to
straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel
and squirts a small amount in his hand.

He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look.

                          LOUIS
             (to himself)
             You are a handsome devil.


LOUIS APARTMENT

Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee
table. He then dances right out the door.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Louis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there.

                          LOUIS
             (puzzled)
             Weird?

Louis walks out into...


HALLWAY

...the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of
his room, across the hall.

                          RYAN BLOOD
             You looking for Quinn?

Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question.

                          LOUIS
             Yes?

                          RYAN BLOOD
             (nodding toward the exit door)
             He just left.


EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In
the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey
holding hands.
                                                      31.


                       LOUIS
          (to himself)
          What do we have here?


EXT. CAFE-MOMENTS LATER

Louis stands across the street, staring right into the
window of the cafe. He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a
date.

His eyes widen as their hands touch.


EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-LATER

Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment
building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns
to face Quinn.

                       ZOEY
          Why haven't I seen your place?

                       QUINN
          My place isn't very exciting.

                       ZOEY
          That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine
          you having a vast Blu Ray collection.

                          QUINN
          Blu Ray?

                       ZOEY
          Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying
          the world around you.
                       QUINN
          You know I realized today you are right
          about that.

                       ZOEY
          So you're saying you want to come up
          stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?

                       QUINN
          (laughs)
          Uh...no. I'm still trying to get I am
          Curious Yellow out of my head.

                       ZOEY
          Yeah...sorry about that...
                                                         32.


                         QUINN
          (smiles)
          It's OK.

Suddenly, guided by instinct, Zoey kisses Quinn on the
lips. Quinn is completely thrown.

                       ZOEY
          I...I..I'm sorry.

                         QUINN
          No don't be.

                       ZOEY
          I shouldn't have been that aggressive.

                       QUINN
          No...it's OK.

                         ZOEY
          OK?

                       QUINN
          I need to get back though.

                       ZOEY
          Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-

                       QUINN
          -Well...I mean...

                       ZOEY
          That came out rude...I just mean...I
          wanted to do it. I should have taken it
          slower.
                       QUINN
          It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.

                         ZOEY
          You sure?

                       QUINN
          Yes of course.

                         ZOEY
          (worried)
          I hope so.

Quinn slowly turns around and walks away. Zoey looks at
him like she is unsure if she will see him again.
                                                         33.


DUMPSTER

Meanwhile, leaning against the dumpster, Louis watches
the display unseen.


INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

Ryan is working at his PC when a KNOCK is heard. He gets
up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the
door.

As he swings it open we see Louis on the other side.


RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Ryan leans back in his desk chair. Louis has cleared off
a spot on a messy couch.

The apartment, simply put, is a "shithole"

                        RYAN BLOOD
           You're here to learn more about his
           "coming and goings". To find out what I
           have seen.

                        LOUIS
           So far you are dead on.

                        RYAN BLOOD
           It's more than that Louis-

                        LOUIS
           -You know who I am?
                        RYAN BLOOD
           I know pretty much everything. I've
           watched you, studied you...I feel I'm
           expert on your little game every seventy
           years.

                       LOUIS
           Really?

                       RYAN BLOOD
           Oh yes.

Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers
one at a time at Louis.

                        RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
           You battled as mortals-
           (beat)
                        (MORE)
                                                       34.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          -You were a Lamanite then-
          (beat)
          -Quinn was a commander of the Nephites,
          last survivor of that nation-
           (beat)
          -The savoir spoke to him, showed him his
          future...his destiny-
          (beat)
          -See after the death of Christ there was
          some debate on what was going to bring on
          the end and signal his return-
          (beat)
          - It was decided two great warriors had
          to fight. The winner would determine the
          start of the apocalypse. Your boss of
          course needed someone to represent his
          interests. Who better than Quinn's old
          adversary?

Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap.

                       LOUIS
          Where are you going with this you weird
          little man?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          You had strategy in the beginning. Middle
          Ages...Old West...Even World War II.
          (beat)
          Let's take a step back for a second. The
          Old West. Lack of faith, corruption,
          these things make Quinn weak. The chink
          in his armor is his faith in people. You
          knew that, and corrupting America...a
          young land...was the key.
          (beat)
          Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked
          for a human ally. That ally was Joseph
          Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led
          Joseph to the plates that later when into-

Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks
down at the "Book Of Mormon".

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          -His little plan didn't work, but the
          book is a great coffee table discussion
          piece. This made him weak Louis. You
          could have destroyed him. The problem is
          you've allowed yourself to become fond of
          him. YOU need to embrace your destiny.

                       LOUIS
          How do I do that?
                                                      35.


                       RYAN BLOOD
          This girl is distracting him. Get his
          mind focused on the matter at hand. At
          this point I'm afraid he isn't even going
          to fight you.

                       LOUIS
          I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn.
          He comes across creepy.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Maybe that's the key-

                       LOUIS
          (lightbulb)
          -Make her think he's crazy.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette
in the far corner.

                       LOUIS
          Where have you been?

The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view.
It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from
the darkness.

                       QUINN
          You've been waiting long?

                       LOUIS
          No I figured you were on your way back-
                       QUINN
          -because you are spying on me again? So I
          don't need to tell you where I've been.

Louis sits down on the edge of the bed.

                       LOUIS
          Who's the girl?

                       QUINN
          It's started again. You're already
          jealous. You are going to do the same
          thing you did during the war...you're
          going to sabotage this.

                       LOUIS
          I'm insulted frankly.
                                                      36.


                       QUINN
          Don't you play that game. You are being
          facetious.

                       LOUIS
          No, I'm being serious. You care about the
          girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship
          or I'm curious about human behavior way.

Quinn sits down beside him.

                       QUINN
          So why are you here?

                       LOUIS
          Have you told her?

                       QUINN
          Who I am? Of course not!

                       LOUIS
          Quinn you only have a few days left and
          you care for this girl-
           (beat)
          - What's the harm in telling her?

                       QUINN
          There's a lot of harm in telling her.

                       LOUIS
          If this is real and you really care for
          this girl, you have to tell her. It's
          only fair to her.

                       QUINN
          She has a best friend who is very guarded
          of me...It's odd she eluded to the same
          thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding
          something, and I need to come out into
          the open" thing.

                       LOUIS
          Sounds to me like she is right.

Quinn gets up and walks to the door.

                       QUINN
          Well I better do this now then.

                       LOUIS
          Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.

                       QUINN
          Can you let yourself out?
                                                      37.


                       LOUIS
          Of course.

Quinn slowly opens the door and walks out. The door
creeps shut behind him.

Louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction. His face
looks evil, almost demonic.


EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING- SOMETIME LATER

In almost a "romantic movie" way, Quinn runs toward
Zoey's apartment. When he reaches the door he knocks like
his life depends on it.

Anna swings the door open, she's obviously surprised to
see Quinn.

                       ANNA
          What the hell?

You can hear Jack inside the apartment.

                       JACK (O.S.)
          What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me
          the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace!

                       QUINN
          I need to see Zoey.

                       ANNA
          What about tomorrow? Or never is good.

You hear Zoey off screen.
                       ZOEY (O.S.)
          What's going on??

Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          Quinn? What's wrong?

                       QUINN
          I need to talk to you, it's important.

Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing
her right past Anna.

                       ANNA
          Jesus Christ!

Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside.
                                                      38.


                       QUINN
          I need to tell you everything. Anna is so
          right.

                       ZOEY
          What are you talking about? Anna is
          right?

                       QUINN
          I've not been honest with you about what
          I do...or who I am.

                         ZOEY
          OK?

                       QUINN
          I need to come clean. I want you to trust
          me. I want your friends to trust me.

                       ZOEY
          (nervous laugh)
          OK Quinn, just spit it out.

                       QUINN
          OK
          (beat)
          I'm an archangel named Moroni and I
          basically represent "light" or everything
          that's good. Louis, my friend, represents
          "darkness". Every seventy years we have
          to fight to the death. If I win
          everything stays the way it is. The world
          continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes
          on the role of the Antichrist and the
          apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking
          Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only
          have a limited time left in this world...
          (beat)
          I want to spend that time with you.

Zoey is stunned, silent.

                         ZOEY
          Oh honey...

Zoey touches his face.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          You must have a brain tumor or something.
          You're obviously mentally ill.

                         QUINN
          Zoey? I...
                                                        39.


Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him.

                        ZOEY
           Shhh. You need me more than ever.

Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She
leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes
Quinn inside of the apartment.

The last image we see is the apartment door slamming

FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-YEARS EARLIER-DAY

Zoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her
parent's home playing.

Her DAD, only seen from the waist down, walks in front of
Zoey with his bible in hand. He makes it to Zoey's MOM,
on the other side of the room

                        DAD
           You're not even helping me!

                        MOM
           I don't even know what you want!

                        DAD
           I can't run my congregation with this
           sickness!
                        MOM
           The sickness is in your head.

                        DAD
           You're too busy running around doing
           whatever you feel like. I'm going to fall
           apart and it's all on you.


FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-TEN YEARS LATER-DAY

Zoey, now 12, is going through some boxes in the closet.
Her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her.

When she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of VHS
tapes.
                                                        40.


She goes through the box looking at the labels: "Anna age
7" "Anna age 10" "Anna age 12".


FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER

The glow of Zoey's TV fills her face. We can neither see
nor hear what she is watching.

Zoey looks like she is about to throw up.

INT. ZOEY'S BEDROOM-PRESENT DAY-MORNING

Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a
nightmare. A startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her,
starts to arouse.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 2 DAYS LEFT


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Louis walks into Quinn's room with his black tote bag
from earlier. It's obvious he was meeting Quinn to go
train.

He looks through out the room, but quickly realizes Quinn
is probably with Zoey. He slumps down on Quinn's bed.
Anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face.

INT.CAFE-LATER

Quinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a
rough night. She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is
distant.

                          QUINN
          Last night?

                          ZOEY
          Yes?

                          QUINN
          Did you?

                       ZOEY
          Enjoy myself? Of course.
                                                      41.


                       QUINN
          Based on how you are acting this morning
          I have my doubts. That's not what I meant
          though. You woke up screaming.

                       ZOEY
          It was nothing.

                       QUINN
          I understand if you don't want to talk
          about it. I'm just concerned.

                       ZOEY
          It's not a big deal. It was...a...well
          wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed
          memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I
          think of it all the time.

                          QUINN
          What is it?

                       ZOEY
          You don't want to hear about it.

Quinn touches her hand.

                          QUINN
          Please?

Zoey takes a deep breath.

                       ZOEY
          My father, I mentioned him before, was a
          Baptist minister. He always said he had
          this "sickness". He begged my mom for
          help, it was more important though for
          her to having shopping and dinner dates
          with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend
          that "loves you", has been in my life
          since I was tiny. She used to come over
          all the time. My Dad adored her. When I
          was around twelve I found something in
          the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from
          the time she was like seven...He...
          (starts tearing up)
          I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got
          out of prison when I was seventeen. I
          don't see him anymore. His church, even
          though they knew he had a problem
          disowned him. He wouldn't have done that
          to Anna if my mom would have supported
          him, got him help.
                                                         42.


                       QUINN
          Who do you think is to blame?

                       ZOEY
          He tried to get help Quinn, he reached
          out to my Mom. I should have protected
          Anna too...I mean-

                       QUINN
          -None of this was your fault.

                       ZOEY
          I have to protect people. This was out of
          my control, you Quinn...What's going on
          with you...I have control of that.

Quinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him
pities her too.


EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER

Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the
same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the
river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices.

                       QUINN
          I love being with you.

                       ZOEY
          Me too.

                       QUINN
          I can't renege on my responsibilities
          with Louis though.
Zoey sits up.

                       ZOEY
          You're not actually going to fight your
          friend to the death are you?

                       QUINN
          I know you don't understand this. We just
          need to make the most of our time.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be
          normal. This is just a delusion.

                       QUINN
          I know you don't understand. I just need
          to go see Louis today.
                                                         43.


                       ZOEY
          I understand that.

Quinn leans his head back. He catches something out of
the corner of his eye.

QUINN'S POV

Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking
video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone".


PARK-RIVERSIDE

Quinn jolts up. Zoey is alarmed.

                        ZOEY
          What is it?

Quinn doesn't answer. He gets up and runs to the...


TREE

Quinn looks behind the tree, but Ryan is long gone. Zoey
comes up from behind, she places her hand on Quinn's
shoulder.

                       ZOEY
          What was wrong?

                       QUINN
          My neighbor Ryan Blood...looks like he's
          spying on me.

                       ZOEY
          What are you talking about?

                       QUINN
          I need to go see Louis.


INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

Louis is watching the video on the smart phone. He's seen
enough, he throws it back to Ryan.

Louis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down.

                       LOUIS
          (sitting down)
          I thought him admitting his true self
          would break them up-
                                                        44.


Ryan plops down in his computer desk chair.

                         RYAN BLOOD
            -Instead he is still hot and heavy with
            her.
            (beat)
            He even did the "bipty boom" last night.

                         LOUIS
            The fight is pointless.

                         RYAN BLOOD
            It's not pointless. The game has just
            changed is all.
             (beat)
            We have two levels here: one is making
            sure we keep him engaged.
            (beat)
            Honestly though that's an afterthought at
            this point-

                         LOUIS
            So what's the next move?

Ryan reaches into his desk drawer.

                         RYAN BLOOD
            (still searching)
            Well when he does become engaged...

Ryan throws something at Louis.

LOUIS POV

Louis catches the item. He looks down to see a nine
millimeter.
                         RYAN BLOOD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
            ...We need to make sure you still have
            the advantage.


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER

Zoey is pacing back and forth. Jack rubs his face in
frustration. He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up
over this guy.

Anna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her
attention

                         ANNA
            What are you doing?
                                                      45.


Zoey is jittery, she can't handle Anna blocking her way.

                       ZOEY
          I haven't heard from Quinn since he
          wigged out today.

                       ANNA
          Well honestly maybe that's a good thing.

                         ZOEY
          He needs me.

                       ANNA
          He doesn't need you! Not everyone needs
          you!

                       ZOEY
          (frustrated)
          This isn't about me and you-

                       ANNA
          -This is about me and you! You think you
          can make up for what happened. The fact
          you didn't notice, couldn't save me in
          time. You were a child! I was a child!
          You couldn't have saved your father
          either! Your mother couldn't have, no one
          could have! He was a fucking pedophile!

Zoey slaps Anna across the face.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          Hate me all you want, but it's impossible
          to redeem yourself for things you had no
          control over.
Jack is sick and tired of this display.

                       JACK
          Just show her the fucking file.

Jack gets up.

                       ZOEY
          (confused)
          What fucking file?


EXT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Quinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like
a jackhammer on the door.

Louis answers.
                                                       46.


                        QUINN
           We have a problem.

                        LOUIS
           You're right. We do.

Louis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the
background.

Louis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face.


INT. LOUIS APARTMENT

Louis turns toward Ryan.

                        LOUIS
           I thought coming here would give us some
           privacy from Quinn.

                        RYAN BLOOD
           I think it worked out perfectly.


INT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-CONTINUOUS

Jack walks into the room holding a file folder. Zoey is
sitting on the couch trying to get a grip.

Jack throws the file in her lap.

                        ZOEY
           So is the file folder for dramatic
           effect?

                        JACK
           No it was to keep everything organized...
           (beat)
           ...and for dramatic effect.

Suddenly Zoey's cell phon rings.

She sets the folder aside and answers.

                       ZOEY
           Quinn?

INTERCUT


EXT. STREET CORNER

Quinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking. At this point he
is lost on what his next move should be.
                                                      47.


                        QUINN
          Ryan Blood!

                       ZOEY
          You mentioned that earlier. What is going
          on?

                       QUINN
          He's with Louis. They're planning to kill
          me.

                       ZOEY
          I thought that was the whole plan.

                       QUINN
          No it's...this isn't like Louis. I think
          he is trying to cheat his way to a win.

                       ZOEY
          Why don't you come over here.

                        QUINN
          I can't!

                       ZOEY
          Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down
          and come over here.

                       QUINN
          You're right.

                       ZOEY
          OK so just come on over and we'll talk.

                       QUINN
          No I mean you're right. I need to get
          control of myself. I have a destiny. I
          need to figure out my next move.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn? No wait-

Quinn hangs up the phone.


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT

Zoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor. Jack picks
up the folder Zoey set aside.

                        JACK
          What is it?
                                                       48.


                       ZOEY
          I don't know. He's losing it.

Jack hands her the folder.

                       JACK
          You need to look at this.

Zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          I spent a lot of time gathering that
          information.

                       ZOEY
          So what is all this?

                       JACK
          Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were
          orphans.

Zoey is flipping through documents.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Quinn displayed some erratic behavior
          from the beginning. One of the staff
          members was Mormon and they would read
          stories to Quinn out of the Book Of
          Mormon. That employee was later fired,
          but a seed was planted in Quinn's head.
          He kept going on about how he and Louis
          were meant to fight to the death. Some of
          the children at the time claim Louis
          would encourage this behavior. He
          probably thought this was Quinn's attempt
          at playing.
          (beat)
          As things continued the staff at the
          orphanage thought Quinn needed help
          beyond what they could offer. They sent
          Quinn to a hospital.

Zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the
floor.

                       ZOEY
          You're not telling me anything I didn't
          already know.

                       ANNA
          That makes it worse. You're going to
          continue this now that you know for a
          fact that he is nuts?
                                                         49.


                       ZOEY
          I'm too far into this now. I don't have a
          choice.

Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the
folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table.

                       JACK
          Why don't you let us save you? Please
          Zoey.

                       ZOEY
          Let me be guys.

Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack
exhausted.


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

The apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than
likely in her room sleeping.

Jack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's
obvious she hasn't slept all night.

She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She
proceeds to pick up the file folder.

She starts thumbing through the documents. After a few
moments she finds one of interest.

She reaches over and pushes Jack.

                       JACK
          (rousing up)
          Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of
          a man.

Jack looks up and sees Zoey.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Or Zoey...What do you need hun?

Zoey hands Jack a document from the folder.

                         ZOEY
          What's this?

Jack's eyes try to focus on the document.

                       JACK
          Looks like a room list from the psych
          hospital.
                                                        50.


                       ZOEY
          I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...

                       JACK
          Quinn and his roommate is listed.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood?

                       JACK
          Yeah...looks that way.

                         ZOEY
          Ah fuck.

                                              JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 1 DAY LEFT


EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Louis stares out into the open field. A gust of wind
blows through his hair.

Ryan Blood comes up from behind and pats Louis on the
back.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          We need to talk.

Louis turns around to face Ryan.

                         LOUIS
          About?
                         RYAN BLOOD
          Strategy.

                         LOUIS
          Strategy?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Yes. I have a method-

                       LOUIS
          -I have to hear this.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          A 12 point system-

                       LOUIS
          (confused)
          - Like 12 steps?
                                                      51.


                       RYAN BLOOD
          Exactly. It's a sure fire plan to throw
          Quinn off of his game

Louis laughs.

                       LOUIS
          Oh I am so all ears.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Well the first thing you need is a battle
          cry.

                       LOUIS
          Excuse me? A battle cry?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Yes a battle cry. Every great warrior has
          one.

                       LOUIS
          And a battle cry is going to give me the
          advantage in battle?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Of course it will. Why don't you try one
          out?

                       LOUIS
          What?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Yeah, try one out right now. It's
          liberating.

                       LOUIS
          I'd rather not.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Come on.

                       LOUIS
          (extremely confused)
          Right here?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Here I'll go first-

Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being
sodomized.

                       LOUIS
          That was...interesting.
                                                        52.


                          RYAN BLOOD
          See?
           (beat)
          Your turn.

Louis looks around.

                       LOUIS
          So right now?

                          RYAN BLOOD
          Of course.

Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes
out more like frightened little girl.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          Oh come on! That sounds like you are
          scared of the battle. What? Are you
          scared of Quinn? You probably are-

Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly
better.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          That's good! Come on!

Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to
jump back.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          Yes that's what I'm talking about!

Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          (noticing Quinn)
           Quinn?!? Good to see you!

Quinn grabs Louis' arm.

                       QUINN
          We need to talk.

                       LOUIS
          (to Ryan)
          Excuse me for a second.

Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some
distance away from Ryan.

                       QUINN
          I know that guy and I don't trust him.
                                                      53.


                       LOUIS
          I don't trust you anymore.

                       QUINN
          Your new friend is dangerous.

                         LOUIS
          So is yours.

                       QUINN
          Leave her out of this.

                       LOUIS
          You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn?

                       QUINN
          It's over. This whole thing is nuts. I'm
          walking away.

                       LOUIS
          Let me walk away from you first then.

Louis starts to walk away from Quinn. He turns around as
he continues to walk backwards.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I'm coming at you! You are in this game
          like it or not!


EXT. ORPHANAGE-DAY

Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick
building. She slowly gets out and starts to look the
structure over. It's almost like she is trying to assess
if she has the right place.

INT. ORPHANAGE-CONTINUOUS

A awkward young man, JAKE, is sorting through boxes. He's
kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files. Zoey
walks up and tries to attract his attention.

                         ZOEY
          Excuse me?

Jake comes out of his world of file sorting. He looks up
at Zoey.

                         JAKE
          (monotone)
           Yes.
                                                         54.


Jake stands.

                       ZOEY
          I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe
          the people here referred to her as
          "mother".

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
           People look for a lot of things.

Zoey is confused.

                       ZOEY
          I'm sure they do.
           (looking at the boxes)
          You guys shutting down?

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
           We are ceasing operations.

                       ZOEY
          Is there something wrong with you?

MRS. RHODES, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of
the back.

                       MRS. RHODES
          Calm down. You need to calm down and
          count to ten.

                       ZOEY
          What? I don't know what that means.

Mrs. Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey. She flaps
them up and down in her face.

                       MRS. RHODES
          You have to calm down and meditate.

                       ZOEY
          Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson
          and Louis Marks? They grew up here.

Mrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a
cross.

                       MRS. RHODES
          No...You need to leave!

                       ZOEY
          What?
                                                      55.


                       MRS. RHODES
          And give me your shirt.

                       ZOEY
          Um...no.

Zoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts
screaming at the top of her lungs.

                       MRS. RHODES
          You better make your peace with God girl!
          The end is coming, those boys are
          ushering in a new era!

Zoey runs down the hallway toward the front door.


EXT. ORPHANAGE

Zoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the
roof of her vehicle in anger

                       ZOEY
          What a fucking nut house!

                       JAKE (O.S.)
          (monotone)
          Excuse me!

Zoey jumps up and screams. She sees Jake standing
creepily behind her.

                       ZOEY
          What!

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
          I know the young boys you speak of.

                       ZOEY
          (doesn't care)
          And?

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
          I was here when Quinn got sent to the
          mental hospital. It was like the other
          one set it up.

                       ZOEY
          Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn
          appear crazy?
                                                         56.


                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           They both believed the same thing. Louis
           was just smart enough to hide it.

                        ZOEY
           There is more to it than that.

                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           I don't understand

                        ZOEY
           Listen "Robot Boy", where did this whole
           belief come from? This isn't something
           two kids come up with on their own.

                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           Yes I believe a seed was planted.

                        ZOEY
           Exactly. I heard there was an employee
           that got fired for sharing Mormon
           mythology with the boys.

                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           No. Off base. He's not the right one.

INTERCUT


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits at the PC while chatting away on his cell
phone. It appears he is looking up information for who
ever is on the other end.


INT.ZOEY'S CAR- CONTINUOUS

Zoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her
cell phone with Jack.

                        JACK
           You might be right sweetheart. The
           employee I was telling you about earlier
           was instrumental in getting Appleridge
           Orphanage shut down.

                       ZOEY
           How?
                                            57.


             JACK
Mrs. Rhodes was pretty well known in
Huntington. I think she felt this guy was
getting in the way of her master plan.
Finally, nearly 20 years later, he
convinced the state what was really going
on there.

             ZOEY
Well...elaborate.

             JACK
That girl you talked to was "pants
crapping nuts". She actually makes your
boyfriend look sane. I guess she believes
that Lucifer came to her in a vision-

             ZOEY
-How is that different than a dream? Just
saying-

             JACK
-I don't know. I think you have to be
awake for a vision.
(beat)
Will you please pay attention? Anyway he,
meaning Lucifer, gave her this jazz
about...well you know the story. Two
angels, fighting to the
death...blah...blah...Anyway he told her
she needed to look after Louis and get
Quinn out of there. I guess trying to
stack the odds in Louis' favor.

             ZOEY
So she had Quinn committed?
             JACK
To the same hospital where her nephew was
a patient. All on the dark lord's orders
I guess.

             ZOEY
Fucking Ryan Blood!

             JACK
Your friends are fucking whack.

               ZOEY
Thanks Jack.

             JACK
So what are you going to do?
                                                         58.


                       ZOEY
          I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle.

                       JACK
          Goddamn Zoey!


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT

Jack realizes Zoey hung up on him. He slowly puts his
phone down and steps away from the computer.

He walks over to the couch and sits down. He lets out a
sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch.


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-A FEW HOURS LATER

Jack is now sprawled out on the couch. Anna walks in the
room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of
him.

She moves his legs and sits down beside of him.

                       ANNA
          So where is she at now?

Jack sits up.

                       JACK
          I got a text about thirty minutes ago.
          I'm pretty sure she is going to head to
          Quinn's apartment.

                       ANNA
          Jack...
                       JACK
          What?

                       ANNA
          Her Christ Complex is going to get her
          killed.

                       JACK
          Trust me I know Anna.
          (beat)
          I know...

KNOCKING is heard at the door. Anna gets up to answer.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Maybe it's Quinn the jackass.
                                                      59.


Anna just gets the door opened a crack when...

Ryan and Louis BURST into the room. Anna SCREAMS. Louis
restrains her against a wall.

Jack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to
the head from Ryan.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Good afternoon boys and girls! I need
          your assistance.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Quinn walks into his room. To his surprise, Zoey is
sitting on his bed. It appears she has been there for a
while.

                       QUINN
          How do people keep ending up in my room?

                       ZOEY
          (laughs)
          You need to learn to lock up.

Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her.

                       QUINN
          I'm not fighting Louis.

                       ZOEY
          Why the change of heart?

                       QUINN
          I think you might be right. I don't think
          it's necessary. I think the world will
          keep turning one way or another. I'm not
          dependant on that.
           (beat)
          I'm not a savior.

                       ZOEY
          Do you really believe? You know?

                       QUINN
          Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually.
          Since I have been with you, I've doubted

          hit me, it really doesn't matter.

                       ZOEY
          I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do
          it for myself...

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          I don't want to do it because I feel I
          have to. Obligations, or dark incidents
          from my past...That's not a reason to
          help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish
          actually.

                       QUINN
          You're not selfish Zoey.

                       ZOEY
          I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely
          my reason for wanting to do this. That's
          a first for me you know?

                         QUINN
          I know...

Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed
together.

QUINN'S ROOM- LATER

Quinn gets pistol whipped across the face. Suddenly we
see Louis picking Zoey up by the hair.

                         QUINN
          (in pain)
           Let her go!

Louis has a hold of Zoey. Quinn gets up and goes for
Ryan.

Louis drop kicks Quinn and sends him flying across the
room.

Louis throws Zoey at Ryan. Ryan then holds her at gun
point.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          (looking at Quinn)
          Let me pretty the girl up a bit

Ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes
out cold from the trauma.

Quinn tries to get to his feet, but Louis kicks him back
down.

                       LOUIS
          Hold on sunshine!
                                                           61.


Ryan throws Louis the gun.

QUINN'S POV

We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with
the gun. Everything goes fuzzy and then we...

INT. QUINN'S ROOM-HOURS LATER

Quinn slowly gets to his feet. He walks over to the
doorway and kneels down.

He sees a puddle of blood...Zoey's blood. He puts his
fingers in it. He inspects his hand, rubbing the blood
between his index finger and thumb.

He jumps up and screams in anger. That would be Quinn's
version of a battle cry.

CLOSE SHOT-JACK'S FACE

A hand rips duct tape off of Jack's mouth. He let's out a
loud scream.

                         JACK
            Mother fucker!


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- CONTINOUS

Quinn crouches down beside Jack.
Jack and Anna are both tied up, Anna still has duct tape
across her mouth. You can hear her muffled screams as
they fill the room.

                         QUINN
            Where's Zoey?

                         JACK
            Fuck you mother fucker! I'm going to call
            the fucking fuzz once you untie me!
            Fucking nut bag, ball sac-

                                                         62.


                       JACK
          Ass fuck salad-

Quinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth. Even
though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still
running off at the mouth.

                       QUINN
          That actually felt kind of good.

Quinn pats Jack on the head.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          I'll be back guys.

Quinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard
through out the apartment.

CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S BED

A long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We
see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it.

Inside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM

Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight.
He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking
like the Bride from Kill Bill.

He walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second.
He's preparing his next move.

Bad ass comic book pose...'nuff said.

The front doors to the church swing open. Light fills the

She heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's,
kneeling. It appears he might be praying.
                                                         63.


She places her hand on his shoulder. As he turns around
she sees her Dad.

He reaches for her, she pulls away. She starts to back
up.

          Take ownership of what you did. Don't

EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Ryan pulls Zoey up to her feet. He presses the gun
against her head.

Louis walks out into the middle of the field. He's
dressed in a full ninja outfit.

He unsheathes his katana.

                       LOUIS
          What do you think Zoey? I'm a ninja!

                       ZOEY
          (struggling under Ryan's grip)
          You're fucking crazy!

             LOUIS
That's not nice! I think I look good.

             ZOEY
I think you're a fucking nut bag.

             LOUIS
This is going to be fun. You'll see.

Mrs Rhodes? Does that name ring a bell?

            RYAN BLOOD
My aunt?

             LOUIS
Yeah...yeah...she played a part in the
game. Tell us something we don't know.
You're such a sexy Nancy Drew right now.

             ZOEY
Go fuck yourself.

             LOUIS
Or a foul mouthed Velma. That gets me so
hard. Does that get you hard Ryan?

             RYAN BLOOD
Can we go back to my aunt please?

             ZOEY
Mrs. Rhodes? What about her? Other than
she fucked you guys up. She taught you,
Louis how to play it straight. Then she
has you fuck Quinn over.
             RYAN BLOOD
She didn't fuck Quinn over. She just
helped him out.

             ZOEY
Yeah by getting him in contact with you.

             RYAN BLOOD
She knew one day it was all going to
catch up with her. She trained me to get
into the game. She told me it was my
destiny.

             ZOEY
Is that why she placed you in that
hospital?
                                                         65.


                       RYAN BLOOD
          She was my caretaker. She told me she was
          sending me someone. Someone I would have
          to guide on to the right path.

                       ZOEY
          Guys I have let my parents fuck me up.
          There comes a time though where you have
          to go out on your own. Take
          responsibility for your own life.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          There is a much bigger purpose. You'll
          see.

                       ZOEY
          This whole thing was to carry out some
          delusional woman's master plan. She
          doesn't even remember who she is at this
          point. I went to see her...she wanted me
          to take off my shirt.

Louis is irritated.

I thought you didn't believe this shit
anymore.

             QUINN
There's more going on than you realize
Zoey.

             ZOEY
This is fucked. Quinn you're not 5000
years old. You were born in an orphanage.
None of this makes sense.

             LOUIS
Lady, it would look weird if we roamed
the earth for 5000 years without facing a
mortal death! We keep getting reborn,
sometimes we even switch physical form.
Thanks for coming to the game late missy!

             ZOEY
That makes total fucking sense. Color me
stupid!

If you win...you're not becoming the
antichrist.

What are you talking about??

It's   Ryan...it's always been Ryan.

(To Ryan)
What is he talking about?
                                                      67.

          He's pitting us against each other.

                       QUINN
          I'm going to be honest with you Louis.
          I've always been honest.

                       LOUIS
          Yeah sometimes to a fault.

                       QUINN
          We have always played this game as honest
          as we could. We never did anything to
          undermine the other. Despite what you
          represent, you have moral code.
          (beat)
          You are not acting with in that code
          today.

                       LOUIS
          I'm tired of losing...

                       QUINN
          You're losing right now. Your actions,
          you can't win like this. Not acting this
          way.

                       LOUIS
          I'm tired of you. I'm going to end it!

Louis goes over to Ryan. He trades his sword in for
Ryan's gun.

Ryan holds the katana to Zoey's throat. Louis points the
gun dead at Quinn.
                       QUINN
          You going to shoot me?

                       LOUIS
          It's the endgame.

Tense moment as Louis aims the gun at Quinn.

SUDDENLY he spins and shoots Ryan dead in the head.

Ryan falls and Zoey gets free.

Louis looks at Quinn and then throws the gun far out into
the field.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          OK...I guess I do have some morals.
                                                        68.


Zoey gets her bearings.

          What the fuck!

                       QUINN
          Zoey go home. We need to finish this.

Louis walks over to Ryan and grabs his katana.

                       ZOEY
          No you don't. Guys what are you doing?

                       LOUIS
          Go home girl!

                       ZOEY
          Are you being serious?

Quinn stops and turns toward Zoey.

                       QUINN
          I will always love you. You have to go
          though.

                       ZOEY
          If you don't walk away from this field
          right now, you will lose me. I will not
          be in your corner. I will call for help.
          They will stop you.

                          QUINN
          Go...

                       ZOEY
          Quinn...last chance.
Zoey walks over to Ryan's body. She searches till she
finds her cell phone in his front pocket.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          I will call the police Quinn...

Quinn looks at Zoey, dead in the eyes.

                          QUINN
          Goodbye.

Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to
attack position and Louis follows suit.

                       ZOEY
          (tearing up)
          Wow...yeah goodbye.
                                                        69.


Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to
stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away.

Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant.
Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by
the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers
film.

We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at
it until we can't tell who is who.


OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE

Zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone.

CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE

She starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position
to hit send.


OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD

Zoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks
back toward where the battle is going on.

She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog.
Finally the jog turns into a full run.


OPEN FIELD

When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All
that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an
empty ninja suit.
Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana.

She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her
beyond the horizon.

          For years we have thought absence of the

Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her

beside her grandmother.

          (motions to Jennifer)
          ...great grandchildren...I spent so much

          from anger or past tragedies.
          (beat)
          Let it come from your heart.

Jennifer turns around.

                         ZOEY (CONT'D)
          What is it?

                       JENNIFER
          My new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to
          meet.

Zoey turns around to see the BOYFRIEND walking toward
them. It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot
like Quinn.

Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the
waist. He reaches his hand out to Zoey.

                       BOYFRIEND
          (nervous)
          Nice to meet to ma'am.

                       ZOEY
          (shakes his hand)
          Likewise.

Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with
Zoey.

                       JENNIFER
          We better get going. We're going to grab
          something to eat.

                       ZOEY
          (to the boyfriend)
          I didn't catch your name.

                       BOYFRIEND
          I'm so sorry. I'm being rude.
                                                         72.


                       JENNIFER
          (laughs)
          He can be like that.

                          BOYFRIEND
          I'm Louis.

Zoey is stunned.

                          JENNIFER
          (to Zoey)
          You OK?

                       ZOEY
          Yeah I'm fine.
          (snapping out of it)
           Enjoy dinner.

                       JENNIFER
          See you later on.

                       BOYFRIEND
          (making eye contact with Zoey, smiling)
          Nice to meet you.

                       ZOEY
          (returning contact, and smiles)
          Likewise.

The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a
second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.

START "DONE AND DUSTED'

CLOSE UP-ZOEY'S FACE
Zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is
more out there. Things that we don't fully understand.
The smile then fades.

Her final look is that of content. And then as Done and
Dusted plays we...

                                                FADE OUT.

               Pevensies are running to the shelter, we hear them shouting, 
               Hurry up! and RUN!
 
               Edmund turns around, as if forgetting something.

                                     EDMUND

                         Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled?

                         I'm afraid so. Is that it then? Haven't 
                         you brought anything else?

                         The professor is unaccustomed to having 
                         children in his house, and as such, 
                         there are a few rules we need to follow. 
                         There will be no shouting' or running', 
                         no improper use of the dumbwaiter, NO 
                         touching of the historical artifacts 
                         and above all, there shall be no disturbing' 
                         of the Professor.

               Looks behind and finds Narnia. Tumnus shows up

                         AAAUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!

                                     TUMNUS
                         (slowly walking out as Lucy picks up 
                         packages) Uh, CH... gk, ch (random noises)
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Were you hiding from me?

                                     TUMNUS
                         Huh, um, n..n.. no, I..I... I didn't 
                         want to scare you,
 
                                     LUCY
                         if you don't mind my asking...what are 
                         you?
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Why, I'm a faun! And you must be some 
                         beardless dwarf?
 
                                     LUCY
                         I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually 
                         I'm tallest in my class.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But you're saying, you're a daughter 
                         of Eve?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Well, my mum's name is Helen...

                                     TUMNUS
                         Yes, but you are, in fact, human.

                                     LUCY
                         Of course.

                                     TUMNUS
                         What are you doing here?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, I came in through the wardrobe 
                         in the spare room, and-
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Spare Oom, is that in Narnia?

                                     LUCY
                         Narnia? What's that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         My dear girl, you're in it!  Everything 
                         from the lamp post, all the way to castle 
                         Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea, every 
                         stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia,

                         This is an awfully big wardrobe

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm sorry, please allow me to introduce 
                         myself, my name is Tumnus
 
                                     LUCY
                         Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends 
                         hand* I'm Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake 
                         it!
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Why?

                                     LUCY
                         I-I don't know! People do it when they 
                         meet each other.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city 
                         of War Drobe in the far land of Spare 
                         Oom, how would it be if you came and 
                         had tea with me?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I 
                         probably should be getting back...
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh, come on! It's not every day I get 
                         to make a new friend! And there's a... 
                         roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And 
                         maybe... we'll even break into the sardines.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Well, maybe for just a little while... 
                         if you have... sardines.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         By the bucket load,

                                     TUMNUS
                         Come Along.

                                     IN TUMNUS' HOUSE
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Can I help you with that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         Why thank you!

               Lucy looks at the picture.

                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh... That is my father.

                                     LUCY
                         He had a nice face. You look just like 
                         him.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         No, were not alike at all really.

                                     LUCY
                         My father is fighting in the war.

                                     TUMNUS
                         My father went away to war too... but 
                         that was a very long time ago... before 
                         this dreadful winter.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating 
                         and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         We haven't had Christmas in a hundred 
                         years here.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shocked) No presents for a hundred 
                         years?
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But, oh, you would have loved Narnia 
                         in spring! The Dryads and the Fauns 
                         would dance all night... but we never 
                         got tired. And oh, the music! Such music. 
                         Would you... like to hear some now?
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         yes please

                                     TUMNUS
                         (gets flute out) Now, are you familiar 
                         with the Narnia lullabies?
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shakes her head): No, I'm afraid I'm 
                         not
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Good, because this probably won't sound 
                         anything like one.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh I must go

                                     TUMNUS
                         It's too late for that now I'm such 
                         a bad faun
 
                                     LUCY
                         No. You're the nicest faun I've ever 
                         met.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor 
                         sampling.
 
                                     LUCY
                         I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll 
                         never do it again.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         It's not something I have done, Lucy 
                         Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         What are you doing?

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch, 
                         the one that makes it always winter, 
                         and never Christmas. She told me that 
                         I If I ever was to come across a son 
                         of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed 
                         to turn it over to her!
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I thought you were my friend



               TUMNUS AND LUCY OUTSIDE/RETURN TO ENGLAND



                                     TUMNUS
                         We must move quietly the woods are full 
                         of her spies, even some of the trees 
                         are on her side
 
                                     LUCY
                         I think so. (Tumnus starts to return 
                         her handkerchief, but she gives it back) 
                         Keep it, you need it more than I do.
 
                         
               Tumnus laughs, and touches Lucy's nose...

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Go...   Come on, go!

               Lucy runs off, and Mr. Tumnus returns to his home

               Lucy heads for the wardrobe



               BACK IN ENGLAND



                                     PETER
                         98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         I'm back, I'm back, it's alright,

                                     EDMUND
                         Shhh, he's coming.

                                     PETER
                         You know, I'm not sure if you two have 
                         quite gotten the idea of this game!
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         but weren't you wondering where I was?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         That's the point! That's why he was 
                         seeking you!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Does this mean I win?

                                     PETER
                         I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.
 
                         
               Susan looks in the wardrobe..

                                     SUSAN
                         The only wood in here is the back of 
                         the wardrobe.
 
                                     PETER
                         One game at a time Lu, we don't all 
                         have your imagination.
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I wasn't imagining!

                                     SUSAN
                         that's enough

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I believe you.

                                     LUCY
                         You do?

                                     EDMUND
                         Yah, didn't I tell you about the football 
                         field I found in the bathroom closet?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Why don't you just stop it, you always 
                         have to make everything worse. Grow 
                         up!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Shut up! You think you're dad, but you're 
                         not! (storms out)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         well, that was nicely handled! (walks 
                         away too..)
 
                                     LUCY
                         It was really there... 

                                     PETER
                         Susan's right. That's enough..



               THAT EVENING... EDMUND ENTERS NARNIA AND MEETS THE WHITE WITCH



               Lucy closes the wardrobe and she dissolves to night

               Pan down on candle burning out, Lucy gets out boots and not slippers 
               and takes candle.
 
               Flushing toilet as Edmund comes out and sees Lucy

               Follows her to wardrobe Candle blows out when she opens it and 
               walks in as Edmund does
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy, Lucy. I hope you're not afraid 
                         of the dark (shuts door)
 
               Lucy, Lucy?

               Edmund is soon in Narnia, he walks around... and is amazed by 
               it all
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy? Lucy! I think I believe you now!
 
                         
               Hears bells.

                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy?

                                     DWARF
                         Yah! (whipping sound)

               Edmund dives out of the way into the snow and then the dwarf 
               jumps out and throws a whip around Edmunds legs
 
               Dwarf puts knife to Edmund's throat

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         What is it Ginarrbrik?

                                     EDMUND
                         He won't let go!

                                     DWARF
                         Is that how you address the Queen of 
                         Narnia?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I didn't know?

                                     DWARF
                         Well, you shall know her better afterwards.
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Wait! What is your name Son-of-Adam?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Edmund, your majesty.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         And how was it, Edmund, that you came 
                         to enter my dominion?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I walked through a wardrobe following 
                         my sister.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Your sister? How many are you?

                                     EDMUND
                         four

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit 
                         with me here on my sledge. (Edmund joins 
                         her) Now, would like something warm 
                         to drink.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops 
                         a green drop on snow that become a hot 
                         drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How 
                         did you do that?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like.

                                     EDMUND
                         Could you make me taller?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like to eat
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Turkish Delight

               Drop once again comes down and makes the box of Turkish Delight 
               and the Dwarf gives it to Edmund
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'd love to see your family

                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I have no children of my own and you 
                         are such a good little boy (I never 
                         could hear those words right) where 
                         I could see, one day, you becoming prince 
                         of Narnia - maybe even king.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mouth full) Really?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (nods) Of course you'd have to bring 
                         your family.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, Peter will be king too?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         No! But a king needs servants.

                                     EDMUND
                         I-I guess I could bring 'em.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Beyond these woods, do you see those 
                         two little hills? My house is right 
                         between them. You'd love it there Edmund, 
                         it has whole rooms simply stuffed with 
                         Turkish Delight!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Couldn't I have some more now?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         NO! (smiles) Don't want to ruin you 
                         appetite.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'm going to miss you Edmund. But we 
                         are going to see each other soon.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         I hope so.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Until then...dear one. (WW drives of 
                         and Ed is left alone)
 
                                     LUCY
                         Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! (hugs her brother) 
                         I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he's fine!!! 
                         The White Witch hasn't found out about 
                         him helping me!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         The White Witch?

                                     LUCY
                         She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, 
                         but she really isn't. Edmund? Are you 
                         okay? You look awful.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Well what do you expect! It's freezing! 
                         How do we get out of here?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Come on...this way.



               BACK IN ENGLAND



                                     LUCY
                         (turns on the light and jumps on Peter) 
                         Peter, Peter wake up! It's there, it's 
                         really there!
 
                                     PETER
                         (rolls over still half asleep) Lucy, 
                         what are talking about?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like 
                         I told you!
 
               Susan comes in.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming.

                                     LUCY
                         No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! 
                         Oh, and this time - Edmund went too.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         You saw the faun?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, he didn't actually go there with 
                         me. What were you doing Edmund?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I-I was just playing along. You know 
                         what little children are like these 
                         days, they just don't know when to stop 
                         pretending (sits on his bed looking 
                         smugly at Lucy)
 
               Lucy starts to cry and runs out of the room. Susan runs after 
               her and so does Peter - who shoves Edmund over
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

               Lucy runs down the hall and smack into the Professor, she looks 
               up a little frightened and then starts her crying all over again, 
               hugging him
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         You children are one shenanigan shy 
                         of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor! 
                         I told them you were not to be disturbed.
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm 
                         sure there's a logical explanation. 
                         But I think this one needs some hot 
                         chocolate.
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         Yes Professor. Come on, dear.

               Mrs. Macready takes Lucy down the hall. Peter and Susan turn 
               to go
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         *Ahem* (the two turn and follow him 
                         into his office and the Professor sits 
                         at his desk and takes some tobacco out 
                         of it's silver apple case and puts it 
                         in his pipe)
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         You seem to have upset the internal 
                         balance of my housekeeper.
 
                                     PETER
                         We are very sorry sir, it won't happen 
                         again.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's our sister sir, Lucy.

                                     PROF
                         The weeping girl?

                                     SUSAN
                         Yes sir, she's upset.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Hence the weeping

                                     PETER
                         We can handle it! (takes Susan's sleeve)
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, I can see that.

                                     SUSAN
                         She thinks she's found a magical land 
                         in the upstairs wardrobe.
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What did you say!?

                                     PETER
                         The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's 
                         found a forest inside.
 
               Susan and Peter sit on a couch and the Professor sits in a chair 
               across from them
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What was it like?

                                     SUSAN
                         Like talking to a lunatic!

                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You're-you're not saying you believe 
                         her?
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You....you actually believe her?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well don't you?

                                     SUSAN
                         Well, logically it couldn't possibly 
                         be there!
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What do they teach at these schools?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Edmund said they were only pretending
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         And he's the more truthful one is he?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         No, this would be the first time.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well then, id your sister isn't lying 
                         and isn't mad then logically we must 
                         assume that she is telling the truth. 
                         She's your sister, isn't she? You're 
                         a family! It's high time you start acting 
                         like one!
 
               


               CRICKET



                                     PETER
                         Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!
 
                         
               Ball hits Edmund in the leg

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

                                     PETER
                         Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we play hide and go seek again?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I thought you said that it was a kid's 
                         game.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Besides, we can all use the fresh air.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Not like there's air inside

                                     PETER
                         Are you ready then?

                                     EDMUND
                         Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground 
                         and gets ready to hit the ball)
 
               Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it 
               smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of 
               armor.


 
               UPSTAIRS



               The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of 
               armor on the floor
 
                                     PETER
                         Well done, Ed!

                                     EDMUND
                         You bowled it!

                                     SUSAN
                         Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming

                                     PETER
                         Run!

                                     EDMUND
                         (runs to the wardrobe and opens the 
                         door) Come on!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         You have got to be joking.

                                     PETER
                         Go!

                                     SUSAN
                         Get back!

               SOUNDS OF KIDS GRIPING

               Susan and Peter fall backwards.



               IN NARNIA



                                     SUSAN
                         Impossible!

                                     LUCY
                         Don't worry, it's probably just your 
                         imagination
 
                                     PETER
                         I don't suppose saying we're sorry would 
                         quite cover it?
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, it wouldn't. But this might!

               Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball, he throws one back 
               at her and a snowball fight
 
               begins. Susan hits Ed in the arm with one

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow! (rubs his arm) Stop it! (They all 
                         realize that Ed lied)
 
                                     PETER
                         You little liar!

                                     EDMUND
                         You didn't believe her either!

                                     PETER
                         Apologize to Lucy. (He just looks at 
                         her)
 
                                     PETER
                         Say you're sorry! (Peter steps up to 
                         him)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Alright! I'm sorry.

                                     LUCY
                         That's alright, some little children 
                         just don't know when to stop pretending. 
                         (looks at him smugly)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mutters): Very funny.

                                     SUSAN
                         Maybe we should go back

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we at lease take a look around?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I think Lucy must decide!

                                     LUCY
                         I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Well Mr. Tumnus it is (walks into the 
                         wardrobe again)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We can't just walk around in these clothes!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         (comes out) We can use these coats.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, they don't belong to us.

                                     PETER
                         Well I don't think the professor will 
                         mind. And if you think about it logically 
                         we are not even taking them out of the 
                         wardrobe. (Hands coat to Edmund)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         But that's a girl's coat!

                                     PETER
                         I know.



               DISCOVERING NARNIA



               Start walking toward Mr. Tumnus' cave through snow

                                     END OF LINE OF LUCY
                         ...and tea and... (Sees open door and 
                         runs off)
 
                                     PETER
                         LUCY!

               They all run to Tumnus' house

                                     LUCY
                         Who would do something like this?

               Edmund steps on broken picture of Tumnus's dad

                                     SUSAN

                         Now we should really go.

                         But we have to help him!

                                     SUSAN

               OUTSIDE AGAIN



               They step outside, they hear rustles from the bushes. Mr. Beaver 
               approaches
 
                                     LUCY
                         It's a beaver.

               Peter approaches the beaver, clicking his tongue

                                     PETER
                         Here, boy *clicks* come here...*clicks*
 
                         
               Peter let's out his hand, Mr. Beaver stares at it then sits upright
 
               
                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Well, I ain't gonna smell it if that's 
                         what you want!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         It's a talking beaver!

                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Lucy Pevensie?

                                     LUCY
                         Yes?

               Mr. Beaver hands her the handkerchief

                                     LUCY
                         This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-
 
                         
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Tumnus. He gave it to me just before 
                         they took him.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Is he alright?

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Further in.(Mr. Beaver scurries off, 
                         Susan grabs Peter by the arm)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, we don't know what you are doing.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         She's right. How do we know we can trust 
                         this beaver?
 
                                     PETER
                         He say's he knows the faun.

                                     SUSAN
                         He's a beaver...he shouldn't be saying 
                         anything!
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Is everything alright?

                                     PETER
                         Yes. We were just talking

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         That's better left for safer corners.

                         He means the trees.

               Walk to Beaver's dam through the cliffs under a bridge and then 
               they see the Dam

                                     MRS. BEAVER

               Edmund shakes off that comment, & enters the dam. Mr. Beaver 
               follows him

               Mr. Beaver laughs.. Mrs. Beaver sees they are serious and lays 
               her hand on Mr. Beaver
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Aslan....you silly little blighter.....you 
                         don't know do you?
 
                                     PETER
                         Well we haven't actually been here very 
                         long
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He's only the king the whole wood, the 
                         true king of Narnia.... and he's waiting 
                         for you!
 
                                     LUCY
                         waiting for us?

                                     BEAVER
                         You got to be joking! Look, Aslan's 
                         return, Tumnus' arrest.....the secret 
                         police! They're all happening because 
                         of you!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         You're blaming us?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Not blaming you dear, thanking you.
 
                         
                                     BEAVER
                         There's....a prophecy, When Adam's flesh 
                         and Adam's bone sits in if Cair Paravel 
                         in throne the evil is over and done.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         You know that doesn't really rhyme.
 
                         
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         I know, but you're missing the point!
 
                         
                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's long been told that two sons of 
                         Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear 
                         to defeat the White Witch, and restore 
                         peace to Narnia.
 
                                     PETER
                         And you think we're the ones???

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Well you'd better be, Aslan's already 
                         fitted out your army!!!
 
                                     PETER
                         I think you've made a mistake; we're 
                         not heroes!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We're from Finchley!

                                     PETER
                         I think it's time we were going.

                                     LUCY
                         But what about Mr. Tumnus?

                                     PETER
                         Sorry Lucy. It's out of our hands.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Thank you for your hospitality.

                                     PETER
                         Ed, time to go- Ed? (looks around the 
                         room) I'm going to kill him.
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         You may not have to...Has Edmund been 
                         to Narnia before?
 
               Shot of Ed walking to the Witch's castle without his coat - shot 
               of the others trying to catch up to him
 
                                     PETER
                         Hurry up!

               They reach the top of the hill and see Ed going through the Witch's 
               castle gates
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shouting) Edmund!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Shh! They'll hear ya!

               Peter starts to run after Edmund but Mr. Beaver grabs him by 
               the sleeve of his coat
 
                                     PETER
                         Get off me!

                                     PETER
                         We just can't let him go!

                                     BEAVER
                         Don't you get it?! He's the bait! She 
                         wants all of ya in there!!! To kill 
                         ya!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         This is all your fault! None of this 
                         would have happened if you had just 
                         listened to me in the first place!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         So you knew this would happen?

                                     SUSAN
                         I didn't know what would happen...
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Stop, this fighting isn't going to help 
                         Edmund
 
                                     BEAVER
                         She's right. Only Aslan can save him 
                         now.
 
                                     PETER
                         Then take us to him.



               EDMUND AT THE WITCH'S HOUSE



               Edmund is walking through the courtyard and see's Giant Rumblebuffin. 
               He walks further in and see's a stone lion - he draws glasses 
               and a moustache on it
 
               Edmund continues through the courtyard, he steps over what he 
               thinks is a log of some sort...only to be lurched on by Maugrim!
 
               
                                     MAUGRIM
                         Stand still stranger!

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm a Son of Adam, I met the Queen in 
                         the woods!
 
               Maugrim gets off him.

                                     MAUGRIM
                         My apologies, fortunate favourite of 
                         the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate.
 
                         
               walks into the throne-room

                                     MAUGRIM
                         Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious 
                         throne, and sits on it longingly. Then, 
                         the witch comes up behind him and says, 
                         scaring him half to death.)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You like it!

                                     EDMUND
                         (he jumps up startled) Ye... yes, your 
                         majesty!
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I thought you might

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tell me, you sisters, are they deaf?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         No

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         and your brother, unintelligent?

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I think so, but mom says...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then how dare you come alone! Edmund, 
                         I ask so little of you
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They just don't listen to me!

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Couldn't even do that!

                                     EDMUND
                         I...I did bring them half way. There 
                         at the dam at the house of the beaver's!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Well...I guess your not a total lost 
                         then.
 
               Edmund approaches again.

                                     EDMUND
                         Is there any chance I may have some 
                         more Turkish delight now?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry

                                     GINNABRICK
                         This way...for your num nums...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Maugrim!!!! You know what to do....
 
                         
               Maugrim let's out a howl, Edmund realizes the horrible truth 
               as wolves surround the castle...they charge from the castle
 
               

               BACK AT THE BEAVERS HOUSE



                                     MAUGRIM
                         Take them

                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Hurry Mum, they are after us!

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         right then...

                                     SUSAN
                         What is she doing?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Don't worry, you'll thank you me later. 
                         it's a long journey and a beaver gets 
                         cranky when he's hungry.
 
                                     BEAVER
                         I'M CRANKY NOW!

                                     SUSAN
                         Do you think we should bring jam?

                                     PETER
                         Only if the Witch has toast.



               GOES INSIDE THE TUNNEL



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         This should lead to Aslan's

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         I thought it lead to your mums!

               Lucy falls howling.

                                     LUCY
                         They're in the tunnel!

               (run further, comes to dead end)

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         You should have brought a map!

                                     BEAVER
                         There was no room next to the jam!
 
                         
               He jumps out of the hole. Everyone else follow. Once Peter gets 
               out, Lucy falls on a bunch of stone things.
 
               Lucy gets up! They all see stone animals!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He was my best mate! (cries)

                         was worse than their bite.
 
               He winces in pain, and continues to talk

               BACK TO THE WITCHES HOUSE.. IN THE DUNGEON



               Edmund, in chains at the witches palace. He attempts to eat the 
               food he is given, but coughs and spits it out, because of its 
               taste. He then attempts to drink a cup, which is frozen. He then 
               throws it on the tray.
 
                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Are you gonna eat that? (from the other 
                         prison)
 
               Edmund gives him the food.

                                     EDMUND
                         Mr... Tumnus.

                         You have the same nose.

               Edmund rubs his nose.

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Is your sister alright? (no answer) 
                         Is she safe?

                         little family was nowhere to be found. 
                         (Lifts Edmund off the ground) Where 
                         are they?!

                         wanted to see you again.

                         him by the Witch) Do you know why you 
                         are here?
 
                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Because I believe in a free Narnia
 
                         
               Witch stares at him coldly

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You're here because he (points at Edmund) 
                         turned you in...for sweeties. (turns 
                         to dwarf and guard) Take him (Tumnus) 
                         upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund 
                         misses his family.
 


               THE ROCK BRIDGE



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Now Aslan's camp is just over there 
                         by the stone table just across the frozen 
                         river.

                         It's the world dear, did you expect 
                         it to be small?

                         Smaller...

               They continue their journey.



               BACK TO EDMUND



               Dwarf brings Edmund up and he sees Tumnus turned to stone

                         Maybe she's gone.

                                     PETER
                         I'll go and have a look

                                     MR. BEAVER

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Neither are you Beaver.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Thanks dear.

               Long pause and some noise then...

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         AHHH!....

                         AHHH!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         I hope you've been good, because there 
                         is someone here to see you.
 
               Father Christmas stands there.

                         Merry Christmas, Sir!

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It certainly is, Lucy. Thanks to you.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         I thought there was no Christmas in 
                         Narnia.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It hasn't been for a hundred years. 
                         But now the Witch's power is crumbling. 
                         (he goes to his bag and throws it to 
                         the ground)

                         Presents!

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for 
                         you. The juice of the fire flower. If 
                         you, or one of your friends are wounded, 
                         one drop of this cordial will restore 
                         them. And though I do not expect you 
                         to use it, this.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Well, I think I could be brave enough.
 
                         
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         I'm sure you could. But battles are 
                         ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan. 
                         Trust in this bow, for it does not easily 
                         miss.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         What happened to, 'battles are ugly 
                         affairs?'
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, though you don't seem to have trouble 
                         making yourself heard, this. When you 
                         put this horn to your lips and blow 
                         it, wherever you are, help will come.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Thanks.

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, Peter. These are tools, not toys. 
                         The time to use them may be soon at 
                         hand.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         Bare them well! I best be off, winter 
                         is almost over and things do pile up 
                         when you've been gone a thousand years. 
                         Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh 
                         and rides off)

                         Wait, maybe we should think about this.

               Stabs sword into the ice, and they float away...

               They get to shore. Peter has Lucy's coat in hand, but no Lucy.
 
               
                                     SUSAN

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Your brother has you well looked after.
 
                         
               Everyone laughs and embraces.

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         I don't think you'll be needing those 
                         coats any more!
 
               Walk through and see spring coming about and flowers budding 
               as they leave there coats and head toward Aslan's Camp
 
               BACK TO THE WATERFALL, THE WITCH, EDMUND AND DWARF

                                     DWARF
                         It's so warm here! (Cold look from Witch) 
                         I think I'll go check the sleigh.
 
                         
                                     WOLF
                         We found the traitor (Carrying the Fox) 
                         He was gathering troops near the sharwood 
                         forest.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Nice of you to drop by. I understand 
                         you were so helpful to my wolves last 
                         night.
 
                                     FOX
                         Forgive me your majesty

                         Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually 
                         talking to you (Looks at Edmund)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (Looks first to Edmund and than at Fox) 
                         Where is ASLAN! Answer me! (About to 
                         hit him with wand)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Wait! The Beavers said something about 
                         the Stone Table and an army.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Thank you Edmund. It is good for this 
                         creature to see some honesty before 
                         he dies..
 
                                     EDMUND
                         NO!(Fox to stone and White Slaps Edmund 
                         across face)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Think who's side you are on. MINE...(turns 
                         his head) Or theirs? If it is a war 
                         Aslan wants (turns butterfly to stone) 
                         It's a war he shall get.
 


               AT ASLAN'S CAMP



                                     SUSAN
                         Why are they all staring at us?

                                     LUCY
                         Maybe they think you look funny.

               Peter smiles.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Oh stop your fussing Mrs. Beaver. You 
                         look lovely.
 
               Peter pulls out sword.

                                     PETER
                         (To Oreius) We have come to see Aslan.
 
                         
               Tent starts to blow in breeze and everyone kneels. Aslan comes 
               from the tent and the children kneel
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Welcome Peter Adam's son, Welcome Susan 
                         and Lucy daughters-of-Eve. Welcome Beavers. 
                          You have my thanks, but where is the 
                         fourth.
 
                                     PETER
                         That's why we are here.

                                     SUSAN
                         We had a little trouble along the way.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         He's been captured by the White Witch
 
                         
                                     CROWD
                         Captured!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He betrayed them your Excellence!

                                     OREIUS
                         Then he has betrayed us all

                                     ASLAN
                         Peace Oreius.

                                     PETER
                         It is my fault really. I was too hard 
                         on him.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We all were.

                                     LUCY
                         Sir, he's our brother.

                                     ASLAN
                         I know dear and that makes the betrayal 
                         all the worse. It may be harder than 
                         you think
 


               PETER AND ASLAN ON HILL



                                     ASLAN

                         You doubt the prophecy

                                     PETER
                         No, that's just it...you're not who 
                         I think I am

                         Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley. 
                         Beaver also said you wanted to turn 
                         him into a hat.
 
               light laughes Peter there is a Deep Magic that rules over Narnia.

                         I don't think I will be able.

                                     ASLAN
                         You were able to get your family here.
 
                         
                                     PETER

                                     ASLAN
                         I will do what I can for Edmund. I too 
                         want my family safe.

               Aslan pins the second wolf to the ground and says to his group
 
               
               Stay back. This is Peter's battle.

               The wolf attacks him. And everyone thinks he is dead

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         Peter... no!

               They run up to him, and see he is alive and looks disgusted by 
               killing the wolf. Aslan lets go the other wolf
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Follow him! He'll lead you to Edmund. 
                         Peter, clean your sword.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane--Knight of 
                         Narnia.
 
               Peter looks at Aslan in awe

               All embrace him and are excited about this



               WITCHES CAMP



               Edmund is tied to tree as the Dwarf taunts him

                                     GENERAL OTMIN
                         The Minotaurs on the left, send in the 
                         dwarfs first.
 
               White Witch looks at the plans and then...

               Aslan's army comes in and there is confusion. White Witch goes 
               through camp and see Dwarf to tree, knife in hat and him tied 
               and gagged. She takes the knife and looks like she's going to 
               kill him then cuts him down
 
                                     DWARF
                         You're not going to kill him?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Not yet! We have work to do (turning 
                         to Otmin)
 


               MORNING ASLAN'S CAMP



               Aslan and Edmund are on the rock above camp Peter comes out and 
               see him and then the girls
 
                                     LUCY
                         EDMUND!

               Peter stops her. Aslan motions Edmund down and they go to the 
               group of his siblings
 
                                     ASLAN
                         What's done is done. There is no reason 
                         to bring up the past with your brother.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Hello...

                                     LUCY
                         Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does 
                         too)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         How are you feeling?

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm feeling kinda tired

                                     PETER
                         Get some rest...and Edmund try not to 
                         wander off again.
 
               Some time later, breakfast

                                     LUCY
                         Narnia isn't going to run out of toast 
                         Edmund
 
                                     PETER
                         then you better pack some for the journey
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         So were going home?

                                     PETER
                         You are, I promised I'd keep you three 
                         safe but there's no reason I can't stay 
                         and help.
 
                                     LUCY
                         but they need us...All four of us

                                     PETER
                         Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost 
                         drowned, Edmund was almost killed!
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Which is why we have to stay.

               They all look at him.

                                     EDMUND
                         I've seen what the White Witch can do 
                         and I've helped her do it, and we can't 
                         leave these people behind to suffer for it.

               Lucy holds Ed's hand.

                                     SUSAN
                         Well I guess that's it then. *gets up*
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Where are you going?

                                     SUSAN
                         (picks up bow and quiver) To get in 
                         some practice.
 
               Susan and Lucy practice shooting at the target. Then it cuts 
               to Peter and Edmund practicing sword fighting
 
                                     PETER
                         Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius 
                         showed us.
 
               The beavers come running up. Edmund's horse rears

                                     EDMUND
                         Whoa horsey!

                                     HORSE
                         My name is Philip.

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, sorry

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         you better come quick the White Witch 
                         has requested a meeting with Aslan...
 

                         
               WITCH IN ASLANS CAMP



                                     DWARF
                         Jadis.. Jadis!!!

               Jadis arrives at the camp, Cyclops carry her bed-thingy...She 
               hops down, and walks towards Aslan
 
                                     JADIS
                         You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.
 
                         
               Everyone gasps.

                                     ASLAN
                         His offence was not against you.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. 
                         I was there when it was made.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then you will know that the boy belongs 
                         to me. (turns to crowd) That boy (points 
                         to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Come and take it then.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You think that a simple threat will 
                         deny me my right, little king? Aslan 
                         knows that if I do not have blood as 
                         the law demands, all of Narnia will 
                         be overturned, and perish, in fire and 
                         water.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Enough, I shall talk with you alone.
 
                         
               (time passes and the Witch exits tent)

                                     ASLAN
                         The Witch has denounced her claim on 
                         Edmund
 
               Narnians cheer.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         How will I know your promise will be 
                         kept?
 
               Aslan roars. the White Witch falls into her seat and the Narnians 
               laugh. The White Witch leaves. Aslan sighs and walks into his 
               tent.
 


               THAT NIGHT...



               Lucy is quietly resting, when she see's a shadow...she wakes 
               Susan
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

               Susan see's the shadow, the two leave their tent. Aslan is leaving 
               the camp...they follow him. and follow him...and follow him. 
               Until-
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Aren't you suppose to be in bed?

                                     LUCY
                         We couldn't sleep

                                     SUSAN
                         Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with 
                         you?
 
                                     ASLAN
                         I would be glad of the company tonight.
 
                         
               (Walk further)

                                     ASLAN
                         It is time. From now on, I must go on 
                         alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. 
                         And farewell.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (later after lots of jeers towards Aslan 
                         as he walks to the Stone Table) Why 
                         doesn't he fight back?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved.
 
                         
               More jeers and catcalls...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, 
                         but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed 
                         in you. Did you really think that by 
                         giving your life you would save the 
                         Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your 
                         life, and saving no one. So much for 
                         love.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         In that knowledge... Despair... and 
                         DIE!!!!!!
 
               She plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes 
               slowly close
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         The great cat is DEAD!!

               Her army cheers loudly.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         General, gather your army and prepare 
                         for battle. However short it may be.
 
                         
               Otmin lets out a huge roar



               AFTER THE WHITE WITCH AND CREATURES ARE GONE


               The girls come up and cry and lean on Aslan. Lucy gets an idea, 
               unscrews her potion
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's too late. He's gone. I'm sure he 
                         knew what he was doing.
 
                                     
                         We have to go.

                                     LUCY
                         We can't just leave him here.

                                     SUSAN
                         Lucy there's not time. We have to tell 
                         the others.
 
                                     LUCY
                         The Trees

               Back at Aslan's camp in the boys' tent

                                     DRYAD
                         Fear not my princes. I come with tidings 
                         of grave news..
 
               Peter walks out of the tent.

                                     PETER
                         It is true, he's gone

                                     EDMUND
                         Then you'll have to lead us. There's 
                         a whole army out there waiting to follow 
                         you.
 
                                     PETER
                         I can't

                                     EDMUND
                         Aslan believed you could. And so do 
                         I.
 
                                     OREIUS
                         what are your orders?

               Peter looks at map... you see the battle field



               BATTLE

                         They come, you highness, in numbers 
                         and weapons far greater then our own.

                                     PETER
                         No, but I bet they help

               Arrival of the Witch's army

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I take no interest in prisoners. Kill 
                         them all
 
               Army charges, gryphons attack

               BATTLE TRULY BEGINS



                                     PETER
                         Are you with me?

                                     ORIEUS
                         To the death!

                                     PETER
                         FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!!

               PETER'S CHARGE BEGINS

               Back to the girls at the Stone Table

               Lucy and Susan wake up.

                                     SUSAN
                         We should go.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm so cold.

               They start walking away...Stone Table cracks

                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

                                     SUSAN
                         What have they done?

               Aslan appears, sending shivers down EVERYONE'S spine!

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         ASLAN!

               Aslan laughs.

                                     SUSAN
                         We saw the Witch, the knife.

                                     ASLAN
                         If the Witch knew the true meaning of 
                         sacrifice, she might have interpreted 
                         the Deep Magic a little differently. 
                         For she would know that if a willing 
                         victim who had committed no treachery 
                         died in a traitors stead, the Stone 
                         Table would crack and death itself would 
                         begin to unwind.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We sent the word that you were dead. 
                         Peter and Edmund would have gone to 
                         war.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (draws knife) We have to help them.
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         We will, but not alone. Now, climb on 
                         my back. We have a long ways to go and 
                         little time to get there. And you might 
                         want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!
 
                         
                                     BEAVER
                         That's the signal! Get ready!

                                     EDMUND
                         FIRE!

               Swish! Bang! Grunt! Crash! Clash! Roar! Aaaahhh!!! Ouch!

               Peter falls off his unicorn. Oreius and the rhino charge

                                     PETER
                         Stop!

               They don't.

               Witch ducks attack, parries blades, spins her wand and turns 
               Oreius to stone
 
               Back to Aslan and the girls.. at the Witches house

               Cuts to stone centaur in the Witch's castle. Lucy and Susan are 
               looking for Mr. Tumnus. Lucy finds him and starts to cry, while 
               Susan hugs her. Aslan walks up and breathes on Mr. Tumnus, and 
               Mr. Tumnus is restored. He falls forward into Lucy and Susan's 
               arm
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan this is...

                                     SUSAN
                         MR TUMNUS!!!!

               They hug....then they see Aslan

                                     ASLAN
                         Come, lets search the castle - others 
                         may still be trapped inside and Peter 
                         will need all the help he can get.
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Ed! There are too many of them! Go! 
                         Get out of here! Get the girls, and 
                         get them home!
 
                                     BEAVER
                         Come on, you heard him!

               Ed starts to leave, then sees the Witch. And starts to go back
 
               
                                     BEAVER
                         Peter said to go!

                                     EDMUND
                         Peter's not King yet!

               Edmund rushes down the hill and breaks the witch's sword, then 
               she stabs him with the remainders of her wand. so the next thing 
               that is actually said is a grunt issued from Edmund and... 
 
               
                                     PETER
                         Edmund!!(silenced)

               Peter and the Witch fight, then they see Aslan

                                     WITCH
                         Impossible!

               Aslan rushes to kill the Witch, everything disappears

                                     ASLAN
                         It is finished.

               The three Pevensies reunite

                                     SUSAN
                         Where's Edmund?

               The dwarf hobbles up and is about to finish Edmund

                                     SUSAN
                         Edmund! (shoots arrow, kills the dwarf)
 
                         
               Edmund coughs and gasps. Lucy pulls out her cordial and places 
               one drop on Edmund's lips. He stops moving momentarily before 
               gasping and sitting up
 
                                     PETER
                         When are you ever going to do are you're 
                         told?
 
               Laughing and hugging  Group Hug Lucy gets the idea to heal everyone 
               and she walks over too someone else who is hurt. Then you see 
               Cair Paravel, and horns blowing. The coronation of the Pevensies 
               began. They walk up the aisle happily, and stand next to their 
               cool chairs.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Bring forth the crowns!

               Tumnus and Mr. Beaver bring out the crowns.

                                     ASLAN
                         (As they put on her crown) To the glistening 
                         eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the 
                         Valiant. To the great western woods, 
                         (puts his crown on) King Edmund the 
                         Just. To the radiant southern sun, (puts 
                         crown on) Queen Susan the Gentle. (crown 
                         put on) And to the clear northern skies, 
                         King Peter the Magnificent. Once a king 
                         or Queen of Narnia, always a king or 
                         queen.
 
                                     EVERYONE
                         Long live King Peter! Long live Queen 
                         Susan! Long live King Edmund! And long 
                         live Queen Lucy!
 
               Aslan walking on the beach in the sunset

               Lucy runs out to the balcony and see him walking away

                                     TUMNUS
                         We'll see him again.

                                     LUCY
                         When?

                                     TUMNUS
                         In time...you mustn't press him, He 
                         isn't a tame lion...
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, but he's good...

                                     TUMNUS
                         Here (pulling a hankie from his person) 
                         I think you need this more than I do.
 
                         
               she takes it and sees that Aslan has disappeared and begins to 
               cry softly, her and Tumnus hold hands as she looks into the sunset.

               WARDROBE AT NIGHT

               Lucy tries to get into the wardrobe and then...

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I don't think you'll get back in that 
                         way...you see I've already tried.

                         Will we ever go back?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I expect so, probably when you least 
                         expect it. What's to say Keep your eyes 
                         open (They walk out the room and the 
                         wardrobe door opens a crack and a light 
                         and smoke come out and we hear a roar)

          CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS.
          Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green
          with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider.
          As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR
          appears from the bottom of frame.
          Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,
          suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg
          tentatively through the air...

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Come on... Just a little lower...
          WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on
          the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over
          his head, is DARREN SHAN.
          Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent.
           The spider just hangs there.

                         DARREN
          Come on... I'll take good care of
          you. All the bugs you can eat.

          MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM
          The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren,
          Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble.
          Maybe that's why they're friends.

                         STEVE
          Hey, Darren!
          No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can
          see any feet in front of the bowls.

                         STEVE
          Did you fall in? Darren!

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Shhh...
          Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up.
          INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall.

                         DARREN
          You're gonna scare him away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         STEVE
          Man, we're getting killed out
          there. It's three to nothing.
          Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little.

                         DARREN
          Your problem, Steve, not mine...
          Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing
          his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet.
          WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and
          then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its
          thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.
          The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve
          who flashes a wicked grin...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

          Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren
          has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles
          through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:

                         STEVE
          GOAL! Three to one!
          The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.
          Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!
          Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just
          over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.

                         STEVE

                         (EXULTANT)
          Three to two!
          Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers
          off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.

                         STEVE
          What does that prove? Huh?
          The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous
          about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.

                         DARREN
          Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2.
          Lunch's almost over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         STEVE
          That's why he kicked it. To kill
          time. Well, I still got time to
          kick your face.

                         DARREN

                         (BLOCKING HIM)
          Forget it. The ball.
          Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.

                         GOALIE
          Thanks, Darren. He's crazy.
          Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.

                         THE STREET
          Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.
          From seemingly out of nowhere...
          A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking
          at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.
          It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.

                         STEVE
          You idiot!
          The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve
          doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.
          But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.
          A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The
          wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve
          notices, snatches it out of the air.
          Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear
          down the street. Creepy...

                         STEVE
          Look at this.
          The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath
          a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and
          other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20
          - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.

                         STEVE
          .Human oddities and other living
          curiosities...

                         (TO DARREN)
          Other. Does that mean not human?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Darren shrugs, takes the flyer.

                         DARREN
          A freak show. Ever been to one?

                         STEVE

                         (GRINS)
          Just this school.
          Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the
          back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the
          Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...

                         CUT TO:

          A BOA OCCIDENTALIS
          Probing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR
          by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because
          we're inside...

          THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY
          The teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room.
          His voice like a metronome.

          MR. DALTON
          As you can see reptiles and
          amphibians are not one in the same.
          As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,
          their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
          FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...
          DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.
          After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.
          He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen
          or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.
          Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet
          for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same
          Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.
          Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:

                         STEVE

          1923...

                         DARREN
          Must be a different one.
          Steve scrolls down through pictures:

          Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...
          Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is
          startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from
          1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.
          Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall
          clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.

                         STEVE
          I gotta show you something...

          Picture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old
          ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder.
          Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two
          other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY

          Moody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed
          blinds streaking the floor where:
          Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and
          pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with
          VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack
          from his backpack, spreads them out as well.

                         DARREN
          I don't get it.

                         STEVE
          Vampires. I've been studying them.
          Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat.

                         DARREN
          Right. You're failing half your
          classes at school, but you're
          studying vampires.

                         STEVE
          They been around 1000's of years.
          Two tribes. They even fight wars.

                         DARREN
          What? When?

                         STEVE
          Okay, sometimes, when humans fight?
          They fight at the same time. And
          no one knows it. Like at the
          Battle of Stalingrad they fought at
          the same time the Russians and
          Germans were fighting.
          Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.

                         STEVE
          Some people know about it. There
          have even been books written.
          He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag.

                         DARREN
          That's your proof? It smells.
          Steve's really trying to convince him now.

                         STEVE
          It's everywhere if you look. On
          the internet, in blogs, newspapers,
          weird places. But you can find it.
          The room starts to tighten a notch around them.

                         STEVE
          I chatted online with one of them.

                         DARREN
          Come on.

                         STEVE
          Serious.
          We become aware of...

          A SINISTER POV
          Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open
          doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind.

                         DARREN
          What was his name? Mr. Dracula?
          Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th
          Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet
          print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         STEVE
          Here he is in 1923. And here 1855.
          Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight.
          Would that make you believe?
          As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them.
          Suddenly Darren spins...
          And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She
          SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.

                         ANNIE
          How'd you know?

                         DARREN
          Saw your shadow on the floor.
          Gotta try harder, knucklehead.
          Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack.

                         STEVE
          I'm gonna get a soda.

                         DARREN
          Get me one, too.
          Steve gets up, stomps out of the room.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Steve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there.
          At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in
          through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door
          open, two sneakered feet behind it.

                         MOM
          I know you want to fight global
          warming, Darren, but that's not the
          way to do it.
          Steve leans back to show his face.

                         STEVE
          Sorry, Mrs. Shan.

                         MOM
          Oh hi, Steve. I thought you were,
          Darren.

          You guys got everything in here.

                         MOM
          Help yourself.
          She sets her PURSE down on the counter.

                         MOM
          How's your mother?

                         STEVE
          She's okay... She's been working a
          lot lately.
          A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something
          about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda.

                         MOM

                         (POINTS)
          Glasses are up there.

                         STEVE
          I know.
          Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to
          pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees...
          The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take
          him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse.
          A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off
          three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP!
          A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling,
          frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
          wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse --
          Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her
          celiphone, so...

                         MOM

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hello?
          .it takes her a second to realize something's up. Not
          listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses
          and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and
          guilt in the air. As she looks over at her purse...

          table, continues into...

                         DARREN'S ROOM
          Darren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve
          reaches past, starts packing it up.

                         STEVE
          I gotta go. See ya tonight.

                         DARREN
          Huh? Tonight where?
          He zips the bag, slings it over his shoulder.

                         STEVE
          Cirque du Freak.

                         DARREN

          Don't sweat it. I got money. Meet
          me ten to Midnight. The Zeiterion
          Theater.

                         DARREN
          That place is supposed to be

          What am I going to tell my parents?

                         STEVE

                         STEVE
          D, it's Cirque du Freak. You wanna
          hear about it Monday? Or see it
          tonight?
          Steve lets his point sink in, then goes.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren and Annie and his mom and DAD eat dinner. Annie
          chatters away.

                         ANNIE
          And that's why we need a dog.
          She waits for an answer. Mom and Dad exchange a look.

                         DAD
          We'll have to think about it.

                         ANNIE
          How do you guys decide who's going
          to say no when you look at each
          other.

                         DAD
          Whoever's eyes are the widest. And
          I didn't say no. Yet.
          As she tries to think through a new approach...

                         DARREN
          Mom? I'm gonna sleep over Steve's
          tonight? Okay?

                         MOM
          (emphatic; no hesitation)
          No.

                         DARREN
          What? Why not?

                         MOM
          Because I said so, Darren.

                         DARREN
          I'm fourteen. I shouldn't even
          have to ask stuff like this.

                         MOM
          The answer is no. And I'm not sure
          I want you hanging around with
          Steve anymore.

                         DARREN
          I've known him since I was five
          years old!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         MOM
          People change and I don't like the
          way Steve's changing.

                         DARREN
          But -- That's not fair!

                         DAD
          Stop arguing with her, Darren.
          Furious at his treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As
          Annie wonders if she should ask what's up...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The moonlight glinting off Darren's spider terrarium.
          Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed.
          Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the
          window. Pulling out the screen, he starts to climb out.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. TRELLIS - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren out his second floor bedroom window, starts to climb
          down via the trellis. CRACK! A section of the trellis
          BREAKS under his feet. Darren almost falls, catches hold.
          He pulls himself over, starts down again.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. UNION STREET - NIGHT

          Part of a dilapidated, mostly abandoned downtown. Noirish.
          Darren and Steve hurry around a corner.

                         STEVE
          I came here after your house.
          There was a van there, guy selling
          tickets.
          (holds up tickets)
          Rest is history.
          They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the
          ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES
          burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans.

                         DARREN
          You know why they closed it, right?
          Years ago a kid fell out of the
          balcony and died. It's haunted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Steve catches himself getting spooked. He shoves Darren.

                         STEVE
          Get inside.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ZEITERION LOBBY - NIGHT

          Paint peeling. The walls scribbled on. Most of all - it's
          dark. Darren and Steve head toward a glow coming from...

                         A HALLWAY
          They move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a
          darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve...

                         DARREN
          The balcony. Where he fell...

                         VOICE
          May I help you?
          They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL.
          Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness.

                         STEVE
          We're here to see the show.
          He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand.

          MR. TALL
          Ticket.
          Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall pockets it, looks to Darren.

          MR. TALL
          Do you have your ticket? Darren.
          Darren starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his
          name. Mr. Tall reaches, takes it.

          MR. TALL
          This way. We're about to begin.
          Mr. Tall turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow:

                         DARREN

                         (LOW)
          He knew my name.

                         STEVE
          Maybe he heard me say it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Mr. Tall turns a corner, only steps ahead of them. But...

                         AROUND CORNER
          When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a
          threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side.
          The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...

          THE ZEITERION THEATER
          Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once
          proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those
          that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching
          the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.
          No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of
          the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a
          TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.
          Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.
          As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second
          stage light goes out.
          And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,
          the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the
          trumpets and all is silent.
          Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it
          was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.
          There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.
          A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage
          in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..
          The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!
          Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of
          the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body
          covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the
          bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain
          hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.
          Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are
          amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.
          Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.

          MR. TALL
          Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to
          the Cirque du Freak. We are an
          ancient circus. We have toured for
          five hundred years...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information.

          MR. TALL
          .Bringing the remarkable and
          grotesque to generations. Our
          freaks are not people in masks.
          They are not harmless misfits.
          What you see tonight is real. Each
          performer unique. None harmless.
          To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the
          bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-
          reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.
          A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of
          TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin
          Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN
          in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.
          Even the Wolfman takes notice.

          MR. TALL
          Beauty and the beast.
          Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper
          body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.
          Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,
          step out and start to push the cage off stage.
          Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same
          languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.
          Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.
          Some in the audience recoil.
          Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...
          From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE
          & SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back
          with their ankles cinched behind there necks.
          As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like
          Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each
          other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like
          pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.
          As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The
          floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.
          After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The
          light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         RHAMUS
          My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And
          I do have two.
          He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in
          the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus
          stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's
          practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.
          More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and
          lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.
          Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it
          and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can
          grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.
          Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows
          them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the
          sound of metal shifting inside.
          The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out
          BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on
          stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.
          He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his
          mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.
          With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.
          Darren & Steve break into applause. So does the audience.
          As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An
          enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out
          to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.
          A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises
          itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly
          transfixed by the light. But in reality...
          The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)
          down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged
          with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists
          over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.
          Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.
          The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body
          SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!
          He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the
          snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides
          forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.
          Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         DARREN & STEVE

                         DARREN
          He's as old as us.

                         STAGE
          Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake
          begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber
          shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back
          to look him in the eye. And then...
          Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like
          he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.
          More applause from the audience.
          Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at
          the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...
          Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's
          nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --

          LARTEN CREPSLEY!
          Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from
          his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his
          left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.

                         DARREN & STEVE
          Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the
          print-out from his pocket, compares.

                         DARREN
          It's him...

                         STAGE
          Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just
          as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the
          footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.

                         CREPSLEY
          It's not true. That all tarantulas
          are poisonous. Though some can
          kill a man. With one bite.
          Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA
          the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out
          individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.

                         DARREN
          Reacts. A spider!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         STAGE
          Crepsley makes the introduction.

                         CREPSLEY
          Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that
          she never learns yours.
          Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the
          stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley
          starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.
          Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The
          spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.
          A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.
          Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.
          Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.

                         CREPSLEY
          No...? Shall it be life?
          Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They
          release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.
          Crepsley faces the audience.

                         CREPSLEY
          I wonder if you would be as shocked
          to see the same fate for me?
          Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --
          taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then
          starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.

                         DARREN & STEVE
          Have a million questions, but right now the performance has
          their full edge-of-their-seat attention.

                         STAGE
          Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.

                         CREPSLEY
          Though we have been together such a
          long time, she is no pet. I think
          she would quite enjoy killing me.
          Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN
          WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         CREPSLEY
          For her bite there is no cure.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence
          about to be directed at her master.
          Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts
          to play, as simple as it is evocative.
          Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,
          starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She
          gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.
          She sways; she's dancing!
          Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley
          keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about
          18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.
          Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it
          around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She
          sails up high over Crepsley's head.
          He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She
          lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.
          Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her
          hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
          Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage
          is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.
          A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing
          happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the
          gloom. It's too dark.
          The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light
          comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.

          MR. TALL
          Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
          That is the end of our show.

                         AUDIENCE MAN
          But... What happened to him?!

          MR. TALL
          Don't you know? What happens to us
          all, can happen to any of us.
          That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion
          seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the
          audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.
          Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.

                         DARREN
          Let's get outta here.

                         STEVE
          No, you go. I'm staying.
          Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows.

                         DARREN
          Wait. What're you doing?
          Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is
          mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.
          As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.
          Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.

                         STEVE
          This is my destiny. Don't ruin it.
          Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands
          in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.

                         STEVE
          That car today. It was a sign.
          Sending me here. I was told
          there'd be a sign.
          Too friggin' weird.

                         DARREN
          Told by who? The guy in the chat
          room? The internet guy?

                         STEVE
          I'll tell you later. If I can.
          Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back.
          Darren stands, whispers into the dark.

                         DARREN
          Steve...
          Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          INT. ZEITERION THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          Darren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts
          sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops
          short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR
          IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.

                         DARREN
          Steve...?
          No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps.

                         CUT TO:

          STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA
          He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he
          heads further into the dark.

                         DARREN
          Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky.

                         DARREN
          Steve...

                         CUT TO:

                         STEVE
          Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a
          costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two
          sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.
          The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a
          corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs
          up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.

                         DARREN
          Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his
          left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...

                         STEVE
          He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside
          pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.

                         DARREN
          Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of
          her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches
          behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         STEVE
          Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be
          filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside.

                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE
          Are you looking for me?
          Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH!
          Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY.

                         DARREN
          Rooted to the spot. Watching...

                         STEVE & CREPSLEY
          Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact.

                         STEVE
          I -- I know who you are.

                         CREPSLEY
          Tell me, boy. Who am I?

                         STEVE
          You're a vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Too broad a definition. Do you
          introduce yourself as a human? Who
          I am is Larten Crepsley.

                         DARREN
          Moving slightly to get a clearer view.

                         STEVE & CREPSLEY
          Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve
          jumps, twists around. Unnerved.

                         CREPSLEY
          Who sent you and what do they want?

                         STEVE
          Nothing. No one.
          Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then what do you want?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         STEVE
          I want to join you.

                         CREPSLEY
          Join me? I don't understand.

                         STEVE
          I want you to make me a vampire.
          Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there
          trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued.

                         CREPSLEY
          Is it because you want to live
          forever? Because we don't.

                         STEVE
          I don't care about living forever.
          But you do seem to live a long
          time.

                         CREPSLEY
          A long time alone. Do you want to
          live alone?

                         STEVE
          I already do.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you an orphan?

                         STEVE
          My father's gone; my mother doesn't
          care about me.

                         CREPSLEY
          Nor mine. You're friendless also?

                         STEVE
          I have a friend, but he doesn't
          understand. He's got too much to
          know what it's like to be alone.
          As Darren reacts to this...

                         STEVE
          When you're alone you feel weak.
          Useless. But I know there must be
          something strong about it, too. I
          want to feel the power of being
          alone. I want to be a vampire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         CREPSLEY
          The power of being alone will never
          be greater than the weakness of it.

                         STEVE
          I don't care.
          Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a
          dismissive hand.

                         CREPSLEY
          It makes no matter. We do not
          blood children. I'm sorry.
          Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2-
          inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you intend to use that on me?
          And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own
          palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face.

                         STEVE
          Do it. Make me a vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do not tempt me.

                         DARREN
          Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly
          get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's
          blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's
          wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately
          begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.

                         STEVE
          What's wrong?

                         CREPSLEY
          You have bad blood.

                         STEVE
          What do you mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         CREPSLEY
          I can taste the menace in your
          blood. You can never be a vampire.
          You're evil.
          Steve scrambles to his feet.

                         STEVE
          That's a lie. You take that back!
          Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly.

                         CREPSLEY
          Go home.
          Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking.

                         CREPSLEY

          GO!
          Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we
          can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone.

                         DARREN
          Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds
          his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over
          and kicks the fridge door closed.
          And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared.
          Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back.
          That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage
          and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

          3 AM. Dead quiet. Darren hurries home, cage in hand.
          Looking over his shoulder. So far so good. He nearly trips
          over an untied shoelace. He sets down the cage, to tie it.
          Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk.

                         DARREN
          Oh. You want that?
          Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat
          and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         DARREN
          See? I'm your friend... You're so
          beautiful I stopped thinking.
          The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage, continues.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          The house dark. Holding the cage with one hand, Darren
          starts climbing the side of the house using the other. He
          avoids the broken section, but as he reaches the window:
          His Dad is standing there looking out. Busted.

                         DAD
          Get inside.
          From his angle, Darren's Dad can't see the cage in his son's
          hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the
          trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Darren stands across from his Dad.

                         DAD
          A freak show? Are you kidding me?

                         DARREN
          It was down at the old Zeiterion
          Theater. Look, dad, I'm sorry.
          It's just, I couldn't resist. I --

                         DAD
          You told me the other day you were
          broke. You were looking for a job
          to do around the house this
          weekend.

                         DARREN
          Yeah? So?

                         DAD
          Where'd you get money for the show?

                         DARREN
          Steve had money.
          Darren's Dad's suspicion is confirmed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         DAD
          Steve... We weren't going to tell
          you, but we think Steve stole money
          from your Mom's purse yesterday.

                         DARREN
          He wouldn't do that.

                         DAD
          Mom's pretty sure about it.

                         DARREN
          Man, what is this? You don't want
          me hanging around with him. Now
          you say you think he stole money?
          Do you know for sure?

                         DAD
          No.

                         DARREN
          Steve's had some bad times lately.
          I'm trying to be a good friend.

                         DAD
          Being a good friend and sneaking
          out are two different things.

                         DARREN
          I have to sneak out! You treat me
          like a kid!
          A moment as Darren's raised voice rings out of the room.

                         DAD
          Then act like an adult if that's
          how you want to be treated. This
          world is crossed by fences --
          Darren interrupts. He's heard it a million times.

                         DARKEN
          I know, I know. And you gotta
          decide which side you stand on.
          And you can't sit on it either.
          His Dad doesn't enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him.
          He starts for the door, looks back before exiting.

                         DAD
          A freak show. What do they do, put
          people in cages for everyone to
          laugh at?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          Darren feels bad, like a kid. He looks down at the floor.

                         DARREN
          It wasn't like that.
          A beat. Darren's Dad goes, closing the door. Darren sighs.
          He goes to the window, pulls up the cage. He scans a look
          outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is clear.

          Darren's Mom making omelettes. Darren's DAD helping, dicing
          up some ham. Annie sits at the table awaiting the results.

                         ANNIE
          Is he in a lot of trouble?

                         DAD
          Nothing a few years in prison won't
          take care of.

                         ANNIE
          I don't see what the big deal is...

                         (TO MOM)
          Did you talk to Steve's mom yet?

                         MOM
          Get this. She said she couldn't
          comment because she didn't make it
          home last night herself.

                         ANNIE
          Where was she?

                         MOM
          Go tell Darren it's breakfast.

          Darren's just snapped her photo with his DIGITAL CAMERA.
          As the door bursts open and Annie enters... Darren scrambles
          to block the cage from view.

                         DARREN
          Annie, you gotta learn to knock.

                         ANNIE
          Mom said to come eat. What's that?
          As Annie tries to look, Darren stays in front of her.

                         DARREN
          Out.
          Annie sighs, heads out. Darren puts the cage in the closet.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Darren arrives, sits as everyone pretends not to notice. His
          mom slides his omelette off the pan into his plate. Annie
          watches everyone's every move. Darren eats a bite.

                         DARREN
          Mom, this is the best omelette I
          ever had.
          His Dad can't help but smile. Good move. Mom is pleased,
          but knows she's being manipulated. As Annie stifles a laugh,
          Darren shoots her a look.
          A KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door
          to reveal: Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie.

                         STEVE
          Hey, midget, where's the idiot?
          Annie motions Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone
          else. He recovers, does his best Eddie Haskell...

                         STEVE
          Hi, Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan. It's nice
          to see ya.

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY

          Darren and Steve enter his bedroom.

                         STEVE
          What was that? Everyone acting
          like they don't know me. Did I
          walk in on something?
          Darren closes the door. Gets to the point.

                         DARREN
          What happened last night?

                         STEVE
          Nothing. I hung out in the theater
          for awhile, but no one was around.
          The lie hangs in the air a moment.

                         STEVE
          Sorry about the way I acted. I'm
          sorry I pushed you.

                         DARREN
          Don't worry. There's, you know, no
          bad blood or anything like that.

                         STEVE
          What?

                         DARREN
          I said don't worry.

                         STEVE
          You said bad blood. I never heard
          you say something like that before.

                         DARREN
          What are you, the word police?
          Steve gives him a look. A weird tension in the air. Darren
          glances at the bandage on Steve's palm, changes the topic.

                         DARREN
          Wanna see that new game I got?

                         STEVE
          Sure...
          Darren steps over, starts his computer up. While waiting,
          Steve sees the digital camera on the dresser, picks it up.

                         STEVE
          I gotta get one of these.
          Steve switches it on. Something occurs to Darren too late...

                         DARREN
          Let me see that --
          On the screen: the PHOTO OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around
          to keep the camera out of Darren's reach.

                         STEVE
          It's Madam Octa.

                         DARREN
          I took it at the show.

                         STEVE
          Liar. Look at the background.
          This got taken right on your desk.
          Darren's caught. As they just stare at each other.

          How'd you do it?

                         DARREN
          They were loading a van outside.
          I, I just took her.

                         STEVE
          Just like that...
          (after a look)
          You stole from a vampire you know?

                         DARREN
          Just because he had a coffin
          doesn't mean he's really a...
          Darren trails off. Steve realizes Darren saw the coffin.

                         STEVE
          You were there, weren't you?

                         (NO ANSWER)
          You heard what he said to me? That
          I was evil?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         DARREN
          I didn't believe it.
          Steve studies Darren, hopes that's true.

                         DARREN
          I heard what you said to him, too.
          That you wanted to be a vampire.
          Steve doesn't want to talk about it. He looks at Madam Octa.

                         STEVE
          How do you think he made her do
          what he wanted?
          Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute.

                         DARREN
          I wish I knew how to play it.

                         STEVE
          I think that was just for show. I
          think he used something else. Some
          kind of mind control.

                         DARREN
          You mean telepathy?

                         STEVE
          I bet anyone with a brain could do
          it. Which leaves you out.
          Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm. The
          tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door.

                         ANNIE'S VOICE
          Can I come in?
          Darren goes to the door. Opens it a few inches.

                         DARREN
          I swear to God, Annie...

                         ANNIE
          What? I knocked.
          As they talk, Steve opens the cage door. Madam Octa sets her
          arms on the edge, pulls herself out.

                         LEAPS --
          Lands on Steve's shoulder. Her fangs, wet with poison, glint
          just before she sinks them into Steve's throat. She BITES!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Steve surges upward, his shout dying in his throat. He
          stiffens, eyes snapped wide, and then crumples to the floor.
          Darren and Annie react as --
          Madam Octa scurries off, disappears behind the curtain.

                         DARREN

                         (TO ANNIE)
          Don't move.
          Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which leans in
          the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it.
          Madam Octa drops down onto the window sill -- WHAM! Wood
          cracks as Darren brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too
          quick. She disappears, leaping out the open window!
          Darren pulls it shut. He rushes back to Steve, turns him
          over. Steve's skin is already a deathly pale.

                         DARREN
          Steve...
          Annie reaches out, takes Steve's hand.

                         ANNIE
          Darren, he's freezing.

                         DARREN
          Get dad. Go.

          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

          Hospital doors BANG OPEN as a gurney bearing Steve is rushed

                         DOCTOR
          What kind of spider was it?

                         DARREN
          I think some kind of a tarantula.

                         DOCTOR
          Where is it?

                         DARREN
          It got away.
          Darren's Dad holds up the camera.

                         DAD
          We have a picture of it.
          The doctor takes it as a NURSE meets the gurney.

                         DOCTOR
          Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor
          Lund. And we need to download a
          photo to poison control.
          This is as far as Darren goes. Steve is wheeled in,
          surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in. All we can see
          of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out.
          PUSH IN ON DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that
          his world has only just started to crash down around him.

          Tough, no nonsense. Marching along, carrying a print-out,
          coming to a stop where Darren sits on a plastic chair. He
          sticks the print-out into his face. The PHOTO of Madam Octa.

          DR. LUND
          How did you make this and why would
          you make this?
          Darren's Mom and Dad start over from down the corridor.

          DR. LUND
          Poison control couldn't ID it. In
          fact, the department of Entomology
          at Harvard couldn't find it in
          their data base. So either it's a
          new species or it's a fake photo.

                         DAD
          If my son said he took that photo,
          then that's the truth.
          Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then:

          What have you done to him?!
          STEVE'S MOM approaches, her eyes on Darren. Disheveled,
          cheap looking, she hasn't quite started her hangover yet.
          She lunges past Darren's dad, grabs Darren by the shoulder.

                         STEVE'S MOM
          Did you hurt Stevie?! Did you?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          She shakes Darren hard. Darren's Dad gets between them. She
          breaks down, sobbing. Darren's mom tries to soothe her as
          she moans about what a bad mother she is.

          DR. LUND
          Your friend's going to die unless
          we find out what's in him.
          On Darren. He looks down to where light spills out from

          Crepsley's COFFIN. A beat and Darren steps up. He grips the

          Madam Octa perched on the side, staring back at him!
          Darren stumbles back. The coffin lid SLAMS to the stage as
          Darren loses his footing, lands on his butt. And then --
          APPLAUSE. One pair of hands create a hollow echo.
          Crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater. Clapping.
          And then he's gone! Only to reappear over Darren, offering a
          hand up. Darren scrambles to his feet. A beat.

                         CREPSLEY
          What have you come for this time?
          Darren pulls out a CRUCIFIX, holds it in Crepsley's face.
          The vampire takes it, looks it over. It has no effect.

                         DARREN
          Crosses don't hurt you?

          Why should they?

          Because... you're evil.

                         CREPSLEY
          Am I? Are vampire bats evil when
          they drink the blood of cows?

                         DARREN
          That's different. Bats are animals.

                         CREPSLEY
          So am I. So are you. Our
          appetites don't make us evil.

          Why are you here?

                         DARREN
          Your spider bit my friend Steve.
          Crepsley shrugs, tosses Darren back his crucifix.

                         DARREN
          He's dying.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, well, boys who play with
          things they do not understand can
          hardly complain if --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         DARREN
          You have to help him!

                         CREPSLEY
          The antidote to her poison is rare.
          Expensive. Why should someone as
          evil as I am waste it on Steve?

                         DARREN
          I'll pay you back. If it takes 50
          years. Whatever it costs.

                         CREPSLEY
          Money doesn't interest me.

                         DARREN
          There's something you want. That's
          why you're here waiting for me.
          Right?
          Crepsley's surprised and pleased by Darren's intuitiveness.

                         CREPSLEY
          The night Steve came below to speak
          to me, you were there. Did you
          hear what we talked about?

                         DARREN
          He wanted to... become like you.

                         CREPSLEY
          You don't just 'become' a vampire.
          The change is too extreme. And if
          the shock didn't kill you, your
          inexperience would. So you become
          one in stages. A half-vampire at
          first. With greater strength than
          a human, but still able to go out
          in sunlight. You learn from a full
          vampire. Do you understand?

                         DARREN
          I think so...

                         CREPSLEY
          But your friend has bad blood.
          He's no good. There's no telling
          what he'll become as he matures.

                         DARREN
          I don't believe that someone can
          have bad blood.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         CREPSLEY
          And yesterday you didn't believe in
          vampires. Regardless, I've left
          the Cirque. Left my protection. I
          need someone to protect me while I
          sleep. I need an apprentice.

                         DARREN

                         (SUDDENLY REALIZES)
          Me?
          Crepsley nods.

                         DARREN
          You're crazy. There's no way.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then your friend will die.
          The words hang in the air. Crepsley smiles.

                         CREPSLEY
          You hardly have a choice. It's
          your destiny.

                         DARREN
          Destiny? That doesn't make sense.

                         CREPSLEY
          Try this then. You're reckless
          enough to steal, responsible enough
          to come back for a friend. That's
          enough for me.

                         DARREN
          Not for me.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, well, destiny can't be
          explained. It must be lived. Now,
          you're wasting my time.

                         DARREN
          There's gotta be another way.

                         CREPSLEY
          There isn't.

                         DARREN
          Please... He's my friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CREPSLEY
          And he slips away while we argue.
          Life or death? Yes or no?

                         DARREN
          You'd never be able to trust me.
          If I got a chance for payback I'd
          take it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes or no?
          Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods.
          Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially
          long, but they look thick and sharp.
          Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws
          blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it.

                         CREPSLEY
          You have good blood.
          Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of
          his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers.
          Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the
          same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.

                         CREPSLEY
          Lift your hands.
          Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into
          all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain.

                         CREPSLEY
          Get used to pain. More lies ahead.
          He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread.
          Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers.
          As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation.

                         CREPSLEY
          The blood flows into your left arm
          and out of your right. Do you feel
          it? Getting near your heart?
          Darren nods, shivers.

                         CREPSLEY
          Almost there.
          A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Crepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his
          fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering.
          Tries to block out any sympathy he feels.

                         CREPSLEY
          The world will start to slow down.
          You'll become a witness of time.
          (snaps out of it)
          Your friend's time is running out.
          He pulls Darren to his feet.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT

          They step out into the moonlight. Darren a little wobbly.

                         CREPSLEY
          Take my arm. Don't let go.
          Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems
          more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet.
          Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the
          road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look.
          The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past.
          A moment later and they're in the...

          HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
          Crepsley pulls loose Darren's hand. They're still bleeding.

                         CREPSLEY
          Lick your fingers. Vampire spit
          will stop wounds from bleeding.
          Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot.

                         DARREN
          How'd we get here?

                         CREPSLEY
          It's called flitting. Which room
          is your friend in?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL - STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Tubes run in and out of Steve. His breathing is labored.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Crepsley leans over him, rolls up one of Steve's eyelids.
          Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye.

                         CREPSLEY
          We're in time. He still has a few
          minutes left.
          Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks
          a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork.
          He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a
          drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls
          murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm.
          A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs
          twitching. Is he dying?

                         DARREN
          What's happening?

                         CREPSLEY
          He was near death. The journey
          back is not pleasant. What do you
          know about him, this boy with bad
          blood?

                         DARREN
          He's my friend.

                         CREPSLEY
          Hmm... Who's his father?

                         DARREN
          Never met him. I don't think Steve
          ever did either. Why do you want
          to know?
          And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on
          Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled.

                         STEVE
          Darren?
          And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing
          deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay.

                         CREPSLEY
          Will you come with me now or do you
          have things to set in order first?
          That's when it really hits home. He's agreed to leave every-
          thing and go off with a vampire. Without really thinking,
          Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on Crepsley.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         CREPSLEY
          I see...
          Darren's almost to the door. Crepsley stays where he is.

                         CREPSLEY
          Run if you want. It won't help.
          You're a creature of the night now,
          Darren Shan.
          Darren turns and bolts leaving Crepsley alone. Chuckling,
          the vampire tucks Steve's covers up under his chin.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HOSPITAL DOORS - NIGHT

          BURSTING OPEN as Darren charges out. Running for his life.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Darren asleep in his bed. The door opens and his mom enters.

                         MOM
          Darren... Wake up, honey.
          Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake.
          As he looks about, wonders what reality he's in.

                         MOM
          I just got off the phone. Great
          news. Steve's going to be okay.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         MOM
          The hospital says it's a miracle.
          Was it a dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip
          of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS.
          Darren instinctively hugs his mom. She thinks he's
          overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back.

                         MOM
          Yeah, it's great news. I know how
          you feel.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          The door opens and Darren steps out. He takes a long look up
          and down the street. Nervous. Then he see the sun up in the
          sky. Relaxes a little. Right... Vampires... Sun.
          He takes a step down the stairs when... From out of the
          bushes... SOMEONE LEAPS!

                         ANNIE
          Boo!
          Darren nearly jumps out of his skin. Annie laughs.

                         ANNIE
          Got you! I finally got you! -
          Darren turns on her, looks like he could kill her.

                         DARREN
          Don't ever do that again.
          Annie's smile drops away. As Darren continues on...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY - SCHOOL - DAY

          Darren walking along, feeling isolated as he moves past the
          other students. Everything seems weird, off.
          A couple of KIDS RUSH past him going into a classroom. Then
          a COUPLE more coming the other way.

                         KID
          Hey, Shan, you gotta see this.
          They duck into the classroom. Darren follows.

                         SCIENCE LAB
          TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around the Boa Constrictor
          tank. Steve holds court.

                         STEVE
          .Doctor said it was a miracle.
          They say I'm unique --
          Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back.

                         STEVE
          Hey, Darren. I've been looking for
          you. We got a lot to talk about.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         DARREN
          Yeah?

                         STEVE
          But first...
          Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through
          an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren
          looks from the mouse to the snake...
          Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries
          to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy.

                         STEVE
          Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What
          happens to us all can happen to any
          of us. If you watch, it's by your
          own free will. Say farewell...

                         HEFTS MOUSE
          .to Crepsley the mouse.
          Darren reacts to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the
          terrarium. Some kids already look away, others are intent.

                         DARREN

                         STOP --
          Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the front.

                         DARREN
          It's cruel.

                         STEVE
          It's nature. Anyhow don't watch.

                         (TO KIDS)
          And don't blink; you might miss it.
          Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium.
          The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner
          away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its
          head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself.
          ZAP! The snake STRIKES...
          And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below
          its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible!
          The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown
          away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning.
          The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Darren scoops up the mouse, drops the snake back in. As he
          starts out, Steve cuts him off.

                         STEVE
          What happened to the spider?

                         DARREN
          I killed it.
          Steve hesitates, processes, looks Darren over.

                         STEVE
          I had a dream. You and Crepsley
          were in my hospital room...

                         DARREN
          Tell me about it later.
          Darren starts away. Steve grabs him hard, spins him around.

                         STEVE
          I'll tell you now.
          Darren reacts instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand
          and SLAMS him against the wall. Steve's nearly off the
          ground, only his left toe touching.

                         DARREN
          I said later.
          Darren lets go, heads off. Steve watches, wonders.

          EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          Darren walks home, hands in pockets. Annie comes up behind.

                         ANNIE
          Darren! Wait up!
          He looks over his shoulder, keep going.

                         ANNIE
          Can I walk home with you?
          He softens, slows down. After a few silent steps.

                         DARREN
          Got you something.
          Darren pulls the MOUSE from his pocket. Annie loves it, cups
          it in her hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         ANNIE
          He's adorable.

          ANNIE & DARREN - A CREATURE'S POV
          Coming in low and fast.

                         STREET
          Annie SCREAMS as a GERMAN SHEPHERD charges, stops just short
          of them. GROWLING like it was rabid. Like it hates Darren.
          Darren steps between it and Annie. Darren's pupils dilate
          oddly; he curls his lip to show his own teeth. The dog
          starts to back off..

                         ANNIE
          Hey. That's King.

                         DARREN
          No it's not. King's my buddy.

                         ANNIE
          That's King, Darren. It is.
          Darren realizes it is King. As Darren realizes something's
          wrong with Darren.. Another growl. From down the street.
          Darren looks back as a black 1966 LINCOLN prowls through the
          intersection. The one seen at school. It slows, windows
          blacked out. As it continues, disappears from view...

                         DARREN
          Come on.
          As Darren hurries Annie along down the street...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren at the kitchen table doing his math homework. His Mom
          makes dinner, chopping vegetables at the sink.

                         MOM
          How was school today?

                         DARREN
          The usual. Sometimes it was
          boring, sometimes really boring.
          Darren's mom laughs. Then...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         MOM
          Ouch!
          She drops the knife on the cutting board. A thick drop of
          BLOOD runs down her finger.
          Darren flinches at the sight and in that moment we PUNCH INTO
          his eyes. The PUPILS swirl red; the IRISES flatten and
          narrow. A dark, ravenous look.

          MOM - DARREN'S POV
          Holding up her finger. Her skin tone receding back into
          gray, the blood pulsing with red vibrancy. Alive. A target.

                         DARREN
          Standing at the blood's seeming siren call. But as he
          suddenly moves forward, she turns away.
          Darren stops as she wraps her finger in a paper towel. She
          looks back at him: misunderstands his hunger for concern.

                         MOM
          It's okay, honey. I just need a
          band-aid.
          Darren looks at his mom's neck. His eyes zero in on a little
          blue VEIN PULSING away. She leaves the room to get a band-
          aid. As Darren's horror sinks in...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren looks at his reflection in the MIRROR. Looking for
          reassurance. He curls his lip, checks his teeth. They look
          normal. He reaches out. Trying to reach himself.
          His hand comes to a stop against the glass. His nails CLICK
          hard against the surface. He scrapes the nail of his
          forefinger along the glass. It leaves a deep scratch.
          Darren starts to freak a little. His breath getting ragged.
          He tries to get a hold of himself, looks back in the mirror.

                         DARREN
          You're different...

          47.

          INT. ZEITERION THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

          Darren walks down an aisle, climbs up onto the empty stage.
          Dark, but Darren moves calmly, like it was noon.

                         DARREN
          Hello? Hey!
          Crepsley appears. Darren turns, sees him. A beat. Crepsley
          raises his hands to the gloom around them.

                         CREPSLEY
          The darkness isn't so scary
          anymore, is it?

                         DARREN
          I'm starting to think it's me
          that's scary.
          Crepsley waits to hear more.

                         DARREN
          It's only gonna get worse, isn't
          it? There's no way back, is there?
          No magic potion to make me human
          again?
          Crepsley shakes his head. Darren nods that he understands.

                         DARREN
          We made a deal. I won't run away
          again.

                         CREPSLEY
          It's neither here nor there, but, I
          do feel sorry for you.
          Darren waves it off, doesn't want to hear it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you ready then? The night is
          young. We can make many miles.

                         DARREN
          I can't just -- My family, I can't
          let them think I just left them.
          Or that something happened to me.
          My mother would... She couldn't...
          As Darren trails off, Crepsley really does look sympathetic.

                         CREPSLEY
          There's only one thing for it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         CREPSLEY
          We'll have to kill you.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. LIVING ROOM - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren's parents watching CNN. Darren comes in.

                         DARREN
          I'm going to bed.
          They say 'good night' to him. Impulsively, Darren kisses his
          dad on the cheek, then does the same to his mom.

                         DARREN
          I love you both. I don't say it
          that much, but I do.
          Darren's Mom is caught off guard, but happy to hear it.

                         MOM
          We love you, too. Don't we, Tommy?

                         DAD
          Of course we do.
          Darren looks at them a beat, then smiles, satisfied.

                         DARREN
          Good night.
          They watch him go, then exchange looks.

                         (SHRUGS)

          INT. ANNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Annie asleep already. Darren enters, pulls his sister's
          blanket up, tucks it under her chin. He whispers:

                         DARREN
          Goodbye, knucklehead. If I can
          ever help you, I will.

          49.

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Darren enters to find Crepsley sitting at his desk. He holds
          a small dark bottle between his fingers (different than the
          one he gave to Steve). As Crepsley's about to speak...

                         DARREN
          Shut up.
          Off Crepsley's reaction...

                         DARREN
          This is my home and I'm never gonna
          see it again, so don't rush me.
          Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All the same, he
          stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look
          around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser.

                         DARREN
          Hold onto this for me, okay?
          Crepsley takes the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return.
          Darren sniffs, recoils at the foul smell.

                         DARREN
          You're sure it will work?
          Crepsley opens the window.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your heart will slow down so
          drastically they won't find a
          pulse. With the fall from the
          window, they'll think you're dead.

                         DARREN
          What if I break bones?

                         CREPSLEY
          Even better. They'll mend in a few
          days. Vampires don't stay broken
          for long and it takes a very long
          fall to kill one.

                         DARREN
          And the funeral home? Won't they
          embalm me or something?

                         CREPSLEY
          Don't worry. I have ways of making
          my thoughts become the thoughts of
          others. They'll leave you alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          Crepsley gestures to the window. Knowing the plan, Darren
          climbs out, his foot resting on the trellis. He looks to the
          ground, back to Crepsley as an odd thought hits him.

                         DARREN
          My dad's allergic to grass. It's
          my job to cut the lawn.

                         CREPSLEY
          You have a new job now. Drink.
          Darren steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back.

                         DARREN
          So this is destiny, huh? Tastes
          like crap.
          Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your breathing is slowing, your
          heart as well. Do you feel it?
          Darren can't answer. He blinks his eyes 'yes' instead.

                         CREPSLEY
          You may be aware of what's going on
          around you. Remember, the grief
          that you hear will be a release for
          those who express it.
          Darren's eyes drift shut. Crepsley lets him go.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren FALLS, crashes through the trellis and thumps into the
          lawn. Crepsley looks down from the window, then disappears.
          CLOSE ON Darren lying face down in the grass. CRICKETS
          chirp. Beyond, a NEIGHBOR walks his DOG. The dog suddenly
          turns in the direction of Darren, pulls on its leash.

                         NEIGHBOR
          No, no, come on --
          The Neighbor stops short as he sees the body.

                         NEIGHBOR
          Hey -- Hey, kid --
          He rolls Darren over, realizes something is very wrong.

          We stay on Darren, the dog sniffing at him as the neighbor
          disappears toward the front door. We hear his fist pound. A
          moment later, Darren's father is there. He looks at Darren,
          up to the open window, realizes he fell. An instant later,
          he's on his knees, cradling his son.

                         DAD
          Darren? Darren!
          A moment later his Mom...

                         MOM
          Darren! Oh my God!
          We're still on Darren's face, his eye open a slit.

          Friends and family passing by. The sounds of people crying.
          TWO CUTE GIRLS from school lean in.

                         GIRL ONE
          He's still cute.

                         GIRL TWO
          I always had a crush on him.
          The Goalie from school soccer is next. He holds a little
          SOCCER BALL in his hand. Tucks it into the coffin.

                         GOALIE
          For the next life, Shan. Top right

          Annie steps up, gently strokes her brother's cheek. Then
          suddenly overwhelmed, she buries her face in their Dad's
          chest. He leans in tenderly over his son. Choked up:

                         DAD
          I love you, Darren. You said it

          Steve nods sadly, looks to Darren. He pats one of Darren's
          hands which are folded across his chest.
          In reality Steve checks Darren's fingertips. A WHITE SCAR at
          the end of each one. Steve's crazy idea may be confirmed.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Darren's coffin is lowered into the ground.

                         MINISTER
          Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in
          sure and certain hope of the
          resurrection to come...
          Darren's Dad tosses a handful of earth down onto the coffin.

                         CUT TO:

          DARREN INSIDE THE CLOSED COFFIN
          The lid an inch from his face. His eyelid twitching as we
          hear shovelfuls of dirt hit the lid. The sound growing
          duller at each turn. Then, as Darren's eye flickers open...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

          Moonless. The sound of digging continues. Only now, dirt is
          coming out of the hole rather than going in.
          Crepsley is digging the coffin back up. Effortlessly.
          Finally, he spreads his feet apart, pulls open the lid.
          Darren sputters as some of the dirt spills onto his face.
          Crepsley reaches down, pulls him up and out of the grave.
          Darren sits on the ground, coughing then moaning.

                         CREPSLEY
          On your feet.

                         DARREN
          My legs are asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Crepsley pulls him up anyhow. Darren stumbles a few steps,
          nearly falls before finding his balance.

                         CREPSLEY
          Walk it off. I'll fill this back
          in. Go. Breathe some air.
          Crepsley closes the coffin, begins to fill the hole as Darren
          ambles off. Not exactly the start of his best day.

          MOVE WITH DARREN
          Passing among the graves, stretching his arms, twisting.
          Really beat up. He looks about, the names and dates on the
          headstones popping into focus even from far away. Night
          vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something:
          Steve. On the other side of a mausoleum. Ten feet away.

                         DARREN
          What are you doing here?

                         STEVE
          (smiles; closing in)
          Vampire hunting.
          Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high
          over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground.
          Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake.
          Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the
          stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A
          desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is
          resurgent. He throws Steve off.
          Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches
          his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams
          him up against the mausoleum, holds him there.

                         DARREN
          What do you have against vampires?
          You wanted to become one yourself.

                         STEVE
          Yeah, I wanted to, but you did.
          You stole my dream. You stole my
          destiny.

                         DARREN
          Are you crazy? I did it to save
          your life. That was the deal. Me
          for you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         STEVE

                         (UNHINGING)
          Liar. You told him I was evil.
          You planned this all along. And
          you'll pay! You'll pay --
          Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him
          struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.

                         DARREN
          I want you to leave...
          Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now.

                         DARREN
          I want you to leave and forget you
          ever saw me. Understand?
          Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in
          two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.

                         STEVE
          I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You
          and the other one. Crepsley. I'll
          put a stake in you and burn you to
          ashes. I'll make sure you never
          come back from the grave again.
          WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by
          the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death...

                         CREPSLEY
          If we ever meet again, I will show
          you loneliness you cannot imagine.
          Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go. Steve takes off
          running. Crepsley looks to Darren.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you still question his blood?
          Darrenthoughtful, doesn't know what to think.

                         DARREN
          Would a stake through the heart
          kill a vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes. But so would getting hit by a
          truck if it was going fast enough.
          Steve finally disappears from sight. Crepsley sighs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CREPSLEY
          He'll be trouble before it's over.

                         DARREN
          Before what's over?

                         CREPSLEY
          This adventure we're on. Shall we
          start?
          Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city.

                         CREPSLEY
          You'll get used to it after awhile.
          Vampires are always saying goodbye.
          A beat, then Darren looks back at him.

                         DARREN
          Let's go.

                         CUT TO:

                         THE SUN
          As it blisters up into, then rises above the horizon.
          Sunrise. Ominous if you're a full vampire.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. RURAL OHIO MOTEL - SUNRISE

          On the edge of the highway. Silhouetted against the sun.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - SUNRISE

          Darren jams a rolled towel along the bottom of a closed door.

                         DARREN
          How's that? Dark enough?

                         CREPLEY'S VOICE
          (on the other side)
          Better.

                         DARREN
          It's sunrise.

                         CREPLEY'S VOICE
          I know the time. I know more about
          the sunrise than anyone alive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.
          Crespley sounds irritated. Darren gets mischievous.

                         DARREN
          Maybe I'll wait until noon and then
          open every door and curtain in the
          place.
          A long tense silence as Darren awaits Crepsley's reply.

                         MOTEL BEDROOM
          Crepsley is a shadow among the shadows. He climbs into bed.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, sunlight would kill me. My
          electrons are different than a
          human's. But it would take several
          hours of exposure. I'd have plenty
          of time to kill you before I closed
          the curtains and went back to bed.
          Crepsley pulls the blanket up over his head.

          MOTEL LIVING ROOM
          As Darren considers this...

                         CUT TO:

          DOORWAY - LATER
          Darren doing pull-ups, a hand on either side of the top jamb.

                         DARREN

          242... 243... 244...
          It's almost effortless. Bored rather than tired, Darren
          drops to his feet. (He still wears his burial suit.)

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

          Darren watching the cars go by on the highway, spots...

                         DARREN
          Minnesota...
          Darren jots this state down on a LIST he's keeping. About
          twenty state license plates so far.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          INT. COUCH - MOTEL ROOM - SUNSET

          A TV droning. Darren asleep. Bathed in a golden glow that
          flickers out as the sun sets. The bedroom door opens.
          Crepsley steps over, looks down at his snoozing assistant.
          Crepsley CLAPS his hands together, nearly against Darren's
          ear. Crepsley smiles as Darren jolts awake.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Getting late, stores closing. The parking lot nearly empty.
          Darren and Crepsley are on a walk and talk.

                         CREPSLEY
          We can die violently. Accidentally
          or otherwise. But we also grow
          old. A full vampire will age one
          year for every ten human years he's
          alive. A half-vampire like you:
          one for every five.

                         DARREN
          I don't understand.

                         CREPSLEY
          I was born in 1774. I became --
          Crepsley looks back to where Darren has stopped short.

                         DARREN

          1774?

                         CREPSLEY
          Should we do the math or not?
          Darren nods. Crepsley motions him to keep up.

                         CREPSLEY
          I became a vampire when I was 20
          years old. In 1794.

                         DARREN

          1794?

                         CREPSLEY
          In Paris. The days of the Terror.
          Heads in baskets. Guillotines up
          and down all day. Really when
          humans put their minds to it, we
          vampires can hardly compete.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Darren's stare jogs him back from the good old days.

                         CREPSLEY
          Math. 1794. So I've been a
          vampire now for 211 years. Hmm?
          Darren nods again, still with him.

                         CREPSLEY
          I age 1 year for every 10, so, 211
          divided by 10, I've aged about 21
          years in that time. That 21 plus
          my first human 20 makes me look
          about 40.

                         DARREN
          But altogether you're 211 plus 20.
          You're really 231 years old.

                         CREPSLEY
          Exactly. You're going to be a
          teenager for a very long time.
          They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this over.

                         DARREN
          Where do you keep your car anyhow?

                         CREPSLEY
          What car?

                         DARREN
          The one you were driving around my
          town in. The old black one.

                         CREPSLEY
          I've never owned a car, Darren. I
          don't need one.

                         DARREN
          It was near school one day. It
          followed me home a few days later.

                         CREPSLEY
          And you saw me behind the wheel?

                         DARREN
          I couldn't see who was driving.

                         CREPSLEY
          It wasn't me.
          As Darren considers this, Crepsley stops suddenly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         CREPSLEY
          There...
          Ahead: just more parking lot. A WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         CREPSLEY
          Dinner.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          The woman nears her car. A chirp as she unlocks it with her
          remote. She opens the back door, sets the book bag on the
          seat. Suddenly she turns, like someone called her name.

                         WOMAN
          Yes?
          Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back
          door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she
          starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.

                         CUT TO:

                         DARREN & CREPSLEY
          Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right
          toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must
          be willing her over. Darren looks terrified.
          But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared.
          The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns,
          tries to figure out who he is and how she got here...

                         DARREN
          Go. Run.
          But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his
          hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she
          passes out. Darren is horrified.

                         DARREN
          Did you kill her?

                         CREPSLEY
          I put her to sleep. She'll be like
          this 15 minutes. When she wakes
          up, she won't remember a thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Crepsley eases her to the ground, finds a vein on her wrist.

                         DARREN
          Will she become a vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. She'd have to share y blood
          for that to happen.

                         DARREN
          Don't take too much.

                         CREPSLEY
          A vampire who feeds often can
          control himself. One who drinks
          only when he must can end up
          feeding wildly.
          He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.

                         CREPSLEY
          The hunger inside us must be fed to
          be controlled. To be civilized.
          It's what separates us from... the
          others.

                         DARREN
          What others?
          But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth.
          Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a
          few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your turn.

                         DARREN
          No. I won't.

                         CREPSLEY
          Darren...

                         DARREN
          I'll never do it.
          Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in.

                         CREPSLEY
          You can lead a vampire to blood,
          but you can't make him drink.

                         DARREN
          I'm only half-vampire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         CREPSLEY
          No matter, you need blood to live
          now. You'll drink eventually.
          When you're hungry enough.
          The wrist is clean, the cut gone. A barely perceptible scar.

                         DARREN
          I'll die first.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (ANGER FLASHING)
          Don't be stupid. You may abstain
          tonight, but you must feed soon.
          Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks
          about, more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.

                         DARREN
          What is it?
          As the woman starts to stir...

                         CREPSLEY
          Nothing. Let's go.

                         DARREN
          Something out there scares you.
          What is it?

                         CREPSLEY
          The thought of spending another
          minute with you.
          Crepsley turns and walks, but Darren's right.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT

          The WAITRESS sets a juicy BURGER down across from Darren.
          Crepsley sits across from him.

                         CREPSLEY
          We still need to eat food, too. I
          just don't need it tonight.
          Darren just sits there. Silently as tears begin to run down
          his cheeks. Crepsley is exasperated.

                         CREPSLEY
          Now what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         DARREN
          The blood... I wanted it. I
          wanted to drink it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Of course you did! You're a
          Crepsley catches himself. He is not without some compassion.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm sorry. It was wrong of me to
          blood you. You're too young. But
          it's done. Like the entire history
          of the world up to this moment.
          Darren quietly cries. Crepsley pulls two paper napkins from
          the dispenser, hands them to him.

                         DARREN
          Thank you.
          Darren turns to face the window as he wipes his eyes, nose.
          Then he sees it: parked across and down the street...
          A black 1966 Lincoln Continental.
          Darren looks back at Crepsley.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (RE: HAMBURGER)
          Eat. Let's not waste anymore food
          tonight.

                         DARREN
          The car...
          Crepsley follows the finger as Darren points.
          DING DING! The bell over the diner door rings...

          CLOSE ON DARREN
          As he looks back over his shoulder at the door.

                         DARREN'S POV
          MR. TINY comes through the front door pimpin'. Peter Lorre
          on steroids. Scary, done up like a Las Vegas high roller.

                         TABLE
          Darren knows trouble when he sees it. He looks back at
          Crepsley, but the vampire is gone! Vanished.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          MR. TINY

                         (STEPPING UP)
          Darren Shan, we meet at last.
          Darren just looks up at him. The guy is practically leaking
          nastiness no matter how avuncular he tries to be.

          MR. TINY
          You're quite a boy. Sacrificed
          everything to save a friend.

                         DARREN
          Where'd you hear that?

          MR. TINY
          A little bat told me.
          Mr. Tiny takes a french fry off Darren's plate, eats it.
          Darren looks around. Where the hell did Crepsley go at a
          time like this? Mr. Tiny knows what he's thinking.

          MR. TINY
          Oh, he's still here.

                         DARREN
          Who is?

          MR. TINY
          Crepsley. Trying to stay alive.
          It's so quiet around them Darren can hear a clock TICKING.
          It's a heart shaped POCKET WATCH Mr. Tiny holds on a chain.

          MR. TINY
          Would you like to see?

                         DARREN
          See what?
          The air seems to buzz as something 'passes'.

          MR. TINY
          Why the fight of course. Boys like
          to watch fights, don't they?
          Mr. Tiny hefts his watch. It almost seems to melt into his
          palm. As he pulls the winding knob out with a CLICK...
          As Darren and Mr. Tiny blink out, disappear from the booth...

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD)

          Darren and Mr. Tiny reappear in the booth, but the
          restaurant's patrons are slowed to near motionlessness.A
          battle royal going on. Crepsley fighting three VAMPANEZE.
          All three are sinewy, whipcords with blotchy purple skin.
          Crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant.
          Whirling, hand fighting. Blocking their thrusts and blows.
          Darren moves to stand. Mr. Tiny pushes him back to his seat.
          Crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip. He drives
          the second one back into the third knocking both back.
          A look to Darren and then he's back on LEG WHIP who's getting
          to his feet. Crepsley drives his flat hand forward, his
          nails tearing into the vampaneze's throat.
          As leg whip's hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem
          the blood, Crepsley grabs his free hand, sends him airborne.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

          As leg whip 'unflits'. The patrons react to him soaring over
          the counter, slamming into the wall --

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD)

          The patrons near frozen again. Leg whip sliding ever so
          slowly down the wall. Crepsley and Sinewy One & Two FIGHTING
          at full speed.
          Sinewy One pulls Crepsley's arm up behind his back. Crepsley
          HOWLING as we hear the bone BREAK.
          Mr. Tiny grabs Darren by the wrist, pulls him toward the
          door. Behind them...
          Crepsley drives the back of his head into Sinewy One's face
          at the same time as Sinewy Two swings in his open palm...
          Sinewy One releases Crepsley who disappears as Sinewy Two
          slices open Sinewy One's throat.
          As Mr. Tiny pulls Darren out the door...

          66.

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

          Crepsley appears. Leg Whip hits the floor. Blood splashes
          the wall as Sinewy One appears, dropping to his knees.
          As Leg Whip stands, Crepsley charges, 'shoulders' him halfway
          through the wall. Patrons SCREAM, react, scatter.
          As Crepsley grabs a knife...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HAMBURGER JOINT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (FLITTING WORLD)

          Darren struggles as Mr. Tiny pulls him along. Behind,
          through the diner windows, WE SEE Patrons frozen in flight.
          Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid
          swing with the knife in his head.
          Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH.
          Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin
          albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing
          veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style.

                         MURLOUGH
          Smell the blood. The lovely blood.
          His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening
          to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth.
          Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr.
          Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
          the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view...
          The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out.
          Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases
          him to move to catch it.
          Darren rushes back toward the restaurant.
          Mr. Tiny catches his watch.
          Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly
          from his side.
          Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat,
          lifts him off the ground.
          Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder.
          Murlough staggers, lets go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          Crepsley takes Darren's hand and they flit, disappearing.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD)

          Beyond the hamburger joint. The world beginning to streak
          past them. The asphalt begins to blur beneath their feet,
          passing cars like they were standing still. But Crepsley
          heaves for breath. In pain.
          Darren looks back over his shoulder...

                         DARREN'S POV
          Murlough follows. Closing ground.

                         DARREN & CREPSLEY

                         DARREN
          It's behind us!
          Crepsley bears down, the buildings streaking by. But...

                         MURLOUGH
          Closes regardless, relentless, death in his eyes.

                         CREPSLEY
          Almost out of gas. But looking ahead. Clocks in an instant:
          a RED LIGHT AHEAD. Cars STOPPED. A CAR FROZEN having just
          crossed the INTERSECTION. HEADLIGHTS from a blind corner.
          Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough's about to catch him from
          behind... Crepsley comes out of flit mode, disappears.
          As Murlough FADES after him.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

          Darren and Crepsley appear on the far side of the crossing.
          Murlough comes out of flit in the center.
          WHAM! The headlights Crepsley saw frozen, but coming from
          the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough!
          He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield.
          As Darren and Murlough disappear again...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          The pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the
          hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street.
          A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No
          Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he
          wipes it, smearing it across his cheek...

                         PICK-UP DRIVER

                         (RUSHING OVER)
          Hey, man, are you okay?!
          He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough
          stands, SWATS the driver aside.
          The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough
          climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STATE HIGHWAY - DAWN

          The sky getting lighter. A SIGN: Now Entering Pennsylvania.

          EXT. HUNTING CABIN - WOODS - DAWN

          Boarded up. Abandoned. Clutching his arm, Mr. Crepsley
          kicks at the door, splinters it. Opens"a gap. Darren
          reaches through, unlocks it. As they step inside, the first
          rays of the sun appear through the trees.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ROOT CELLAR - DAWN

          Crepsley climbs down a few steps, closes the door behind him.
          Barely any light, but some.

                         CREPSLEY
          Find a blanket. A rug. Cover it.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HUNTING CABIN - DAWN

          Darren drags a CARPET over the root cellar door in the floor.

                         ROOT CELLAR
          It goes black except for a glint in Crepsley's eyes. He
          sighs, settles down on the ground. Worn out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Are you okay?

                         CREPSLEY
          My arm's broken. But it should be
          fine in a day or two.

          INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
          Sunlight fills the kitchen. Darren sits, exhausted.

                         DARREN
          Who were they? Vampires?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. The one with the watch was Mr.
          Tiny. Very dangerous.

                         DARREN
          How dangerous can a man named Mr.
          Tiny be?

                         CREPSLEY
          Who said he was a man?

                         DARREN
          Then what is he?

                         CREPSLEY
          Mr. Tiny can't be explained. He
          needs to be experienced.

                         DARREN

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          And the purple guy. What was he?

                         CREPSLEY
          A vampaneze.

                         DARREN
          Yeah? Keep talking.

                         CREPSLEY
          Long ago humans were looked upon as
          animals by some vampires. Cattle
          to be slaughtered. Laws were
          passed to forbid needless killing.
          It made it easier to pass unnoticed
          among humans if we didn't murder
          them. Most vampires obeyed...

                         DARREN
          But some didn't?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CREPSLEY
          Seventy vampires broke away,
          declared themselves a separate
          race. The Vampaneze. Over time
          their appearance changed, their
          numbers grew. They believe it's
          wrong to feed from a human without
          killing it.

                         DARREN
          What? That's crazy.

                         CREPSLEY
          They believe those of us who feed
          in small amounts live like leeches.
          In shame. It led to war.
          Crepsley touches the scar on his face, remembers.

                         CREPSLEY
          The last one nearly destroyed us
          all. There's been a truce for many
          years now.

                         (A BEAT)
          Will you be alright while I sleep?
          Darren looks around at the dilapidated crap heap he's in. As
          he tries to hold his heart together...

                         DARREN
          Oh yeah... This is so much better
          than where I used to be...
          Crepsley hears the strain in his voice. Knows what's best
          for both of them..

                         CREPSLEY
          What do you think of rejoining the
          Cirque du Freak? Until you get on
          your vampire feet so to speak.

                         DARREN
          Half vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, yes. Three-eighths if you
          want. What do you think?
          As Darren thinks...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MR. TALL'S AIRSTREAM TRAILER - NIGHT

          The Cirque is camped by an ABANDONED FACTORY. Neo-Gothic in
          scale and mood. Lit up for a performance. Mr. Tall, pulls
          on his jacket, shouts orders.

          MR. TALL
          Show time in twenty minutes.
          Someone tell Rhamus to get his
          stomachs in gear!
          He's surprised to see Crepsley and Darren walk up the road.
          Crepsley's arm seems much better now.

          MR. TALL
          Larten'Crepsley! As I live and
          breathe. I thought it would be
          years before I saw you again.
          Mr. Tall looks to Darren, throws a surprised look to
          Crepsley. Crepsley nods. 'Yes'.

          MR. TALL
          Darren Shan. You've come a long
          way since the last time I saw you.

                         DARREN
          I liked it better where I was.

          MR. TALL
          I'm sure.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you still have my coffin?

          MR. TALL
          Of course. You're really back?

                         (CREPSLEY NODS)
          Perhaps you could do the show
          tonight? A few of us are absent or
          ill this evening.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'd be delighted.

          MR. TALL
          Mr. Shan will have to pull his
          weight as well. I'll give him to
          Evra. Evra! EVRA!

                         (LOOKING ABOUT)
          I hope I haven't gone from one
          unreliable boy to two.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          Evra arrives. The snake boy from the first Cirque show.

          MR. TALL
          Evra, my industrious wonder. Here
          is Darren. Put him to work with
          you. Show him the snakey ropes.
          As the two boys consider each other...

          MR. TALL
          Off with you. Go!
          As the boys head off, Mr. Tall looks over at Crepsley.

          MR. TALL
          You blooded a child, Larten? What
          were you thinking?

                         CREPSLEY
          You don't approve?

          MR. TALL
          I don't matter. What will the
          vampire generals say when they hear
          about it?

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm no longer part of their domain.

          MR. TALL
          So you say. They may disagree.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT

          As Darren and Evra make their way through.

                         EVRA
          What do you do? Me? I'm a snake
          boy. I do a whole snake thing.
          Evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps to
          illustrate. It's strange. Funny. Evra looks back over.

                         DARREN
          Do you eat mice?

                         EVRA
          Big Macs actually.
          They share a LAUGH. Evra 'high fives' Darren. Fast friends.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          As they continue, Darren looks at the palm of his hand. A
          few of Evra's SCALES have come off and are stuck there.

                         DARREN
          I caught your act in the last town.
          Pretty cool.

                         EVRA
          Thanks. I'm not doing it tonight.
          My snake caught a cold.

                         DARREN
          Snakes can catch cold?
          Evra nods, then SNEEZES himself.

                         EVRA
          Still gotta work the floor though.
          Ushers. We get the seats filled.
          They pass PEOPLE all hurriedly crossing the camp.

                         DARREN
          Who are they all?

                         EVRA
          The backbone of Cirque du Freak.
          They do the driving, the tent
          pitching, the potato peeling even.

                         DARREN
          How did they end up here?

                         EVRA
          Most wandered in. If Mr. Tall
          likes them, they stay.
          Darren's eye is caught by the WOLFMAN. He's being pushed
          toward the factory building by several of the blue-robed
          LITTLE PEOPLE. The wolfman's yellow eyes are on Darren as he
          rumbles a low, guttural growl.
          Darren is so taken that he almost walks into...
          Madam Truska. He stops short. In costume, beardless, even
          more beautiful than when we first saw her. She considers
          Darren, uses a finger to raise his chin. She shakes her
          head, smiles. As she continues...

          74.

          INT. FACTORY SPACE - NIGHT

          An odd setting, but it works well. Stripped, ragged, weird.
          Feels like a rave. The lighting dramatic, the concrete walls
          ominous. PATRONS take their seat around a stage. A buzz in
          the air.

                         DEBBIE & SAM
          About the same age as Darren and Evra, they're here for the
          show. Debbie is self-assured. Sam is sarcastic to cover his
          insecurities. Right now it's hard to find a seat.
          And here are Darren and Evra. Evra looking cool in his green
          sharkskin, Darren still wearing his burial suit.

                         EVRA
          Can we help you find a seat?

                         DEBBIE
          Are there any left?

                         EVRA
          Only the best seats in the house.
          He leads them a few steps over toward a column.

                         DEBBIE
          You guys are with the Cirque?
          Darren nods. Sam's a little sarcastic and skeptical.

                         SAM
          Cirque is French, right? Are you
          guys French?

                         EVRA
          Oui. Vous etes observateur. Nous
          sommes les serpents frangais.
          That slows Sam a beat. Evra points out a small platform
          eight feet up the column. You have to climb a natural re-bar
          ladder to get there. Sam looks dubious, but Debbie smiles.

                         DEBBIE
          Cool... I'm Debbie, this is Sam.

                         EVRA
          Evra Von.
          She looks at Darren, waiting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         DARREN
          Oh, I'm Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          Is the show great? Say yes. We
          had to sneak out to see it.

                         DARREN
          I snuck out to see it once, too.
          And I'm still here.
          An odd, almost spooky moment. Is he serious?

                         SAM
          Good one, Darren. Hey. Debbie and
          Darren. Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          And their friend Evra Von what?
          That breaks the moment. Debbie starts climbing the re-bar.
          Sam looks Darren over a beat, picks a thread off his lapel.

                         SAM
          Dude, it looks like the kind of
          suit you'd wear to a funeral.

                         DARREN
          You have no idea...
          Evra smiles, sticks out his tongue. Pointy, narrow, Evra
          sends it up his own nostril. Sam tries to smile, then starts
          up after Debbie. Freaked out. As Darren and Evra laugh...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. THE STAGE - NIGHT

          Mr. Tall under a spotlight. Back in his red hat and gloves.

          MR. TALL
          Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
          are an ancient circus. Bringing
          the remarkable to generations...

                         BACK ROW
          Darren and Evra watch from the back, whisper to each other.

                         DARREN
          How long have you known Mr. Tall?

                         EVRA
          Five years.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         DARREN
          How do you meet someone like him?

                         EVRA
          I was raised in a circus, but not a
          nice one like this. The owner used
          to beat me and keep me in a glass
          cage. I felt like a useless freak.
          One night I looked out of my cage
          and saw Mr. Tall just standing
          there. He watched me until the
          owner came over and asked if he
          could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed
          him by the throat and strangled him
          to death. Then he opened the cage
          and said, "Let's go, Evra." He
          named me that. I added the Von.
          I've been with him ever since.
          Darren looks back at Mr. Tall with a new set of eyes.

                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE
          Darren...
          Darren turns. Crepsley's back there in the shadows.

                         CREPSLEY
          How do you feel about show
          business?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. THE STAGE - NIGHT

          The audience reacts as Crepsley 'appears' on the empty stage.

                         CREPSLEY
          To be poisoned by a spider may be
          my fate.
          It's Darren's cue. Looking appropriate in his burial suit,
          he walks out carrying Madam Octa's cage at arm's length.

                         DEBBIE & SAM
          As she realizes it's Darren. Cool.

                         STAGE
          Darren sees Debbie who gives a little wave. As he smiles...

                         CREPSLEY
          Look glum... Miserable...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          Darren loses the grin. Crepsley opens the cage. Madam Octa
          steps to the opening. Crespley raises the flute, plays.
          Madam Octa walks out and up to Darren's shoulder where she
          attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to
          Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances
          across to the music, spinning a web as she goes.
          Darren looks out, sees how much Debbie enjoys it.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE MOON - NIGHT

          Set against the black sky. Sparks rise up, their source
          unknown. All very mysterious until... LAUGHTER. Lots of
          it. Borderline raucous. We follow the sparks DOWN to...

                         A BONFIRE
          Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The freaks are eating,
          drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy camp.
          Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying
          watching everyone else enjoy themselves.
          Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick.
          Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And
          he's certainly never experienced anything like this.
          Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum.
          Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her
          as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the
          hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a
          mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away.
          Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives
          him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. AN OLD VAN - NIGHT

          A mattress on the floor inside. Using tape and cardboard,
          Darren 'blacks out' the windows. Crepsley steps over.

                         DARREN
          Almost done.
          Crepsley looks to the sky. Still dark. The moon setting.

                         CREPSLEY
          Darren...
          (Darren looks over)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CREPSLEY (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to sleep here. We'll
          find a nook in the factory.
          Crepsley starts off. Darren starts to follow.

                         CRESPLEY
          Mattress.
          Darren sighs, goes back to the van to retrieve the mattress.
          He starts to pull it out, then stops, nearly doubled over.
          Concerned, Crepsley steps over. Darren waves him off,
          straightens as whatever it was passes.

                         DARREN
          I just felt sick for a second.

                         CREPSLEY
          You need blood.
          Darren gives him a dirty look, grabs the mattress. They
          start walking toward the factory.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT

          The SHADOWS of a loading dock. Crepsley and Darren approach.

                         DARREN
          You think Mr. Tiny might come?
          Crepsley shrugs, doesn't answer.

                         DARREN
          Who is he? What does he want?

                         CREPSLEY
          What we want is who we are, don't
          you think?

                         DARREN
          Can't you give me a straight answer
          just once?!

                         CREPSLEY
          You won't learn by me telling you.
          You must live some things to know
          what they are.
          Darren sighs in deep frustration. Crepsley has a thought.

                         CREPSLEY
          Okay. Why do you like spiders?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Darren tires to figure what he's getting at? Implying?

                         CREPSLEY
          Did you ever think there was a
          particular reason?
          It seems Crepsley knows the answer even if Darren doesn't.

                         DARREN
          No. I never thought about it.

                         CREPSLEY
          That's the trouble with children.
          They don't think about things.

                         DARREN
          I'm not a child.
          Theystop by the shadows.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you a man? If you're not a
          man, you're a child.

                         DARREN
          I'm in between.

                         CREPSLEY
          In between does not exist!
          The words echo a moment. Darren no closer to understanding.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'll sleep in here tonight. But
          sit outside the van tomorrow and
          make it look like I'm there. It's
          just caution. Old habits die hard.

                         VOICE
          And old vampires?
          Without a sound, someone has reached around the two of them
          from behind, a RAZOR-KNIFE held to each of their throats.
          They stand dead still. We can make out the shape of a head
          as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark.

                         CREPSLEY
          Gavner Purl, as always I heard you
          coming from a mile away.
          CLICK! In his hand by his side, Mr. Crepsley holds a thin
          SWITCHBLADE. He presses the steel back ever so slightly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         VOICE
          We'll call it a draw then.
          The 'voice' pulls back his knives, steps out. It's GAVNER
          PURL. He was once handsome, but those days are long gone.
          His face is crossed with scars. They vary in size, thickness
          and color. Gavner is a warrior, carries himself so.

                         GAVNER PURL
          It's been too long, Larten.

                         CREPSLEY
          Decades now.
          They embrace. Darren's trying to catch up.

                         DARREN
          You guys are friends?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I suppose. We once shared a coffin
          together. For six months.

                         DARREN

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Like roommates? To save money?

                         GAVNER PURL
          We were being hunted.

                         DARREN
          Who was hunting you?

                         CREPSLEY
          Never mind. Darren, Gavner Purl.
          Gavner extends his hand to shake. Darren sees'the scars on
          Gavner Purl's fingertips. Darren raises his own hand so
          Gavner can see his scars. Gavner looks at Crepsley.

                         GAVNER PURL
          A half-vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          Of course. We don't make full
          vampires of our assistants.
          Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley, stunned.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Nor do we make assistants of
          children.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          GAVNER PURL (cont'd)

                         (LOSING IT)
          A child, Larten? Why?!

                         CREPSLEY
          I have my reasons.

                         GAVNER PURL
          And they are?

                         CREPSLEY
          I don't owe answers to vampires
          anymore. I'm exiled from our kind

                         GAVNER PURL
          Self-exiled. And I at least am
          owed an answer.
          There's a personal history being called upon here. Crepsley
          is well aware. Darren again is left out.

                         CREPSLEY
          All I care to say is a boy sought
          me out, knew who I was. He asked
          me to make him my assistant.
          Gavner looks to Darren, suspicious.

                         GAVNER PURL
          And how did you know --

                         CREPSLEY

                         (INTERRUPTS)
          It wasn't Darren. Another boy.
          His blood was bad. I should have
          killed him, but I didn't.
          Darren reacts. Gavner considers it all.

                         CREPSLEY
          I met Darren shortly after. His
          blood was good or I certainly would
          have killed him.
          Darren reacts again.

                         GAVNER PURL
          How could a boy find you?
          Crepsley shrugs. Of course he had help.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Tiny?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         DARREN
          He tried to kill us.

                         CREPSLEY
          He tried to kill me. What he
          wanted with you wasn't determined.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Perhaps you chose the wrong boy.
          In Mr. Tiny's eyes.
          A moment as they consider the unspoken implications.

                         DARREN
          What are you guys talking about!?
          No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look.

                         CREPSLEY
          What's important enough to track
          down an exile? What is your news?

                         GAVNER PURL
          War.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm not interested in your wars.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Well the other side is interested
          or they wouldn't be trying to get
          rid of you.
          Crepsley gets suddenly very angry.

                         CREPSLEY
          I've had enough killing! No more!
          You've come to the wrong place. I
          am the wrong place...
          Gavner raises his hands in surrender.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Even so, I'm glad you're alive.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (RELENTING)
          The sun is coming. Will you stay?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I can still make miles. The war
          won't wait. And neither will bad
          news. I have to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then travel safely.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Would you mind if I walk a bit with
          your assistant?

                         CREPSLEY
          Take him with you if you want.
          He's of little use to me.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NOT FAR OFF - NIGHT

          Darren and Gavner Purl walk. Gavner looks him over.

                         GAVNER PURL
          You look sick. Doesn't Larten feed
          you?

                         DARREN
          I won't drink blood if that's what
          you mean. I promised myself.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Why?

                         DARREN
          You'll get insulted.
          As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him...

                         DARREN
          I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll
          become evil.
          Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself.

                         GAVNER PURL
          The only thing drinking blood will
          do to you is keep you alive.

                         DARREN
          That's how it would start. I would
          swear it was just to stay alive.
          But what'll I turn into? You're on
          one side of the fence or the other.
          My father used to say that and now
          I know what he meant.
          The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         GAVNER PURL
          You've already turned, Darren. You
          need to accept what you've already
          become. There's no going back.
          They walk in silence a moment. Then:

                         DARREN
          Why did Crepsley make himself an
          exile anyhow?

                         GAVNER PURL
          He was tired of all the killing.
          We were at war.

                         DARREN
          With the vampaneze?

                         GAVNER PURL
          Crepsley was once a Vampire
          General. One of our great leaders.
          He may seem reluctant, but I assure
          you, no one is as skilled at
          killing vampaneze than Crepsley is.
          I think that's why they'd like to
          get him out of the way. Kill him
          off before the new war starts.

                         DARREN
          You've known him a long time?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I was his assistant. He blooded
          me, as he blooded you.
          There's almost something comforting in this news. Gavner
          Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know...

                         DARREN
          Why'd he choose you?

                         GAVNER PURL
          To teach me to kill vampaneze. Up
          until now, it's the only reason he
          ever chooses anyone.

                         DARREN
          Is it why he chose me?
          Gavner hesitates, not sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         GAVNER PURL
          That's for Crepsley to say. Not
          me.
          Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Do you know what the biggest danger
          is to a vampire, Darren?

                         DARREN
          The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny?

                         GAVNER PURL
          No. It's that they live so long
          they no longer care. Everything
          they love is left behind until they
          finally have nothing left to live
          for. Except death. The fact that
          he's taken an apprentice seems, to
          me, a good sign. A sign that he's
          thinking of living not dying.

                         DARREN
          Lucky for me. Glad I could help.
          All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner,
          meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead.

                         GAVNER PURL
          A clear run. Good.
          Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Stay by him, Darren. Stay by him.
          Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his
          image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating
          up. And then he's gone.

                         DARREN
          That part is definitely cool.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE SUN - DAY

          High in the noon sky. PAN DOWN to where Darren stands under
          a tree by the old van. He concentrates, looks himself over.
          Nothing. He concentrates again. He's trying to flit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Very briefly -- the air shimmers around him -- then stops.
          He looks at his arms. Little WISPS of smoke come off them.

                         EVRA

                         (ARRIVING)
          What's up?

                         DARREN
          Nothing.

                         EVRA

                         (SNIFFS AIR)
          It's smells like burnt hair.

                         DARREN
          Don't know. I'm congested.

                         (SEES SOMETHING)
          Hey...
          Evra follows his gaze, turns just in time to see:

                         THEIR POV
          Debbie and Sam ducking inside the factory.

                         DARREN & EVRA
          Exchange a look. Start after them.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

          Where the show was the night before. Light streams down from
          gaps in the decrepit roof. No sight of Debbie and Sam as
          Darren and Evra make their way in.- They pause at a CREAKING
          coming from somewhere overhead. As they move...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - DAY

          Darren and Evra come off a rickety staircase, pass through a
          half-rotted door. There are holes in the roof overhead and
          huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through.
          They see Sam, his back to them, staring out a smashed window.

                         EVRA
          Let's scare the crap out of him...
          They begin to creep in, flanking the unsuspecting Sam. But
          as they get close, a SHAPE drops down behind them!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         SHAPE

          ARRRGGGH!
          Darren and Evra are the ones who jump. The shape is Debbie!
          She almost falls over laughing. So does Sam.

                         DEBBIE
          You should see the look on your
          faces.
          But Evra and Darren are not laughing.

                         EVRA
          What're you doing here?

                         DEBBIE
          We could ask you the same thing.
          We come here all the time. My
          grandfather used to work here.

                         DARREN
          Must've been a long time ago.

                         DEBBIE
          He says now it's like one of those
          bombed out World War II cathedrals.
          Empty of what is used to be.
          An odd little moment till Sam breaks it.

                         SAM
          Hey, we loved the show, man. It
          was off the hook.

                         EVRA
          (messing with him)
          Off the hook, huh? I'll tell all
          the freaks you said so.

                         SAM
          Are you guys on your own? Just
          traveling. No parents or nothing?

                         DARREN
          No. No parents.
          He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on.

                         SAM
          School?

                         EVRA
          No school either.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         SAM
          You're the luckiest guys on earth.
          Wanna switch places?

                         DARREN
          You have to be different to be
          here.

                         DEBBIE
          Different how?
          Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to
          life, the green of his scales catching the rays. Debbie's
          mouth drops. They couldn't see it in the dark last night.

                         EVRA
          Everyone has a place they belong.
          The Cirque du Freak is ours.

                         DEBBIE
          I think your skin is beautiful.
          That wins Evra over.

                         DEBBIE
          Can I touch it?
          Evra holds out his arm. Debbie traces a finger across it.

                         DEBBIE
          Wow. Has it always been this way?

                         DARREN
          He's a snake-boy.

                         DEBBIE
          You shouldn't call him names
          because he looks different.

                         EVRA
          It's okay. I am a snake boy.

                         SAM
          You could say you're
          dermatologically challenged.
          They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          What about you, Darren? How are
          you different?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         DARREN
          I get scared easy.
          Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped.

                         DARREN
          How'd you get up there anyhow?

                         DEBBIE
          You mean, how did a girl get up
          there?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FACTORY ROOF - DAY

          A spot where the roofing is gone, several long RAFTERS
          stretch out. Darren, Evra and Sam watch Debbie walk out on
          one. Like a balance beam. The factory floor 70 feet below.

                         EVRA
          Hey, be careful.

                         SAM
          Don't worry. She's like a gymnast.
          Debbie moves slowly at first, her arms stretched out for
          balance. Then she does a hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp.
          She gets to the other side, turns and bows.

                         DARREN
          You're crazy!

                         DEBBIE
          How about you?

                         DARREN
          I got nothing to prove.

                         DEBBIE
          But it'd be easier for you than me.

                         DARREN
          Why's that?

                         DEBBIE
          Because chickens have wings.
          She starts chicken CLUCKING. Mad, Darren steps onto a
          rafter, starts across. He stops in the middle, spins around.
          Aided immeasurably by his half-vampire skills.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          Debbie is impressed.

                         ANGLE OVERHEAD
          The vertigo angle as Debbie walks back out on her rafter.
          Stops about 4-feet across from Darren.

                         DARREN & DEBBIE
          Darren crosses his arms across his chest. No big deal.

                         DEBBIE
          Let's play mirrors.

                         DARREN
          What's that?

                         DEBBIE
          I do something and you have to copy
          me. Like this.
          Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has. He
          uncrosses them as he realizes.
          Debbie reaches down, touches her toes. Darren sighs, then
          does the same, gets a good look at the floor below.
          Debbie takes one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top
          of it with one hand, raising the other arm out for balance.
          Looks like a ballerina.
          Evra doesn't like this daredevil stuff.

                         EVRA
          Come on, guys...
          Darren hesitates. Not because he won't do it, but because
          maybe for the first time in his life, he's really fascinated
          by a girl. Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.
          Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly.
          Without warning, Debbie leaps the gap, lands on the rafter
          alongside Darren. As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren
          reaches out and steadies her. As they come face to face.

                         DEBBIE
          There definitely something
          different about you. I just can't
          figure it out.

                         DARREN
          Is Sam your boyfriend?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         DEBBIE
          He's my cousin.

                         DARREN
          Oh...
          A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter. Finally...

                         DARREN
          We should get off this.
          She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off...

                         DARREN
          Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.

                         DARREN'S POV
          The area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.

                         RAFTER
          Darren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams...
          Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it.

                         DEBBIE
          Hold on.
          Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts out to help, but the
          rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the obvious.

                         SAM
          I don't think it'll hold you, dude.

                         EVRA
          Thanks for the heads up... Bro.

                         DARREN
          (shakes it off)
          It's okay. I'm okay.
          Darren swings up a leg, hooks it over the rafter. A beat and
          he's back on top. Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he
          came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter.

                         DEBBIE
          I don't know how you hung on. I
          couldn't have.

                         DARREN
          You wouldn't have fallen in the
          first place... I just got dizzy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         DEBBIE
          Maybe you need to eat something.
          Darren looks at her. She has no idea.

                         EVRA
          Well, the food's down on ground
          level. Let's get out of here.
          Sam and Debbie start off, Darren and Evra following. As Sam
          and Debbie start down a ladder, Darren hangs back a beat.

                         DARREN
          She's kind'of cool, huh? I mean,
          for a girl.

                         EVRA
          I like her. She asks a lot of
          questions though.

                         DARREN
          She's just curious.

                         EVRA
          There's no such thing as 'just'
          with a girl.

                         DARREN
          What makes you such an expert?

                         EVRA
          My snake's a girl.

          EXT. FACTORY - SUNSET

          The sun peeps below the horizon.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY PASSAGE - NIGHT

          Darren walks along, flashlight in hand. Going somewhere. He
          suddenly stops, listens, not sure if he heard something. A
          following FOOTSTEP?
          MOVE WITH Darren as he continues. As he passes through a
          doorway, he ducks around the corner. Waits a few beats.
          Then he leaps out to see who's following. No one's there.
          Shaking his head, he continues on.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Darren knocks on a door, waits a beat before it opens and
          Crepsley emerges from his sleeping place.

                         CREPSLEY
          Good morning, Darren.

                         DARREN
          What's good about it?
          Crepsley looks him over, doesn't like what he sees.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT

          Bustling with activity. Nearly show time. Crepsley stands
          by an open tent flap watching Darren cross camp. Not well.

                         DARREN
          He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with him.

                         SAM DEBBIE
          Hey, Darren. Hi...
          Darren's happy to see them.

                         DARREN
          You guys are coming to the show
          again tonight?

                         DEBBIE
          Of course. Evra's doing his snake
          act tonight.

                         DARREN
          Oh, you came to see Evra.

                         DEBBIE
          And you...
          Darren smiles shyly at that.

                         SAM
          I was hoping for Amanda Bynes.
          Darren sees Crepsley watching him from the tent.

                         DARREN
          Hey, I'll catch up with you later.
          I got some stuff I gotta finish up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          They watch as Darren heads off.

                         SAM
          He's gonna be gone in another day
          or two. Tonight's the last show.

                         DEBBIE
          I know that. So?

                         SAM
          So stop looking at him like you
          love him.

                         DEBBIE
          You're such an idiot, Sam.

                         TENT OPENING
          Darren joins Crepsley, a little unsteady.

                         CREPSLEY
          Look at you. You can barely stand.

                         DARREN
          I'm fine.

                         CREPSLEY
          You need to feed. You need blood..

                         DARREN
          No! I won't let you hunt some poor
          person down for me. I --
          Crepsley grabs hold of Darren, hauls him into...

                         THE TENT
          Dark, the inside walls richly embroidered. Medieval.

                         CREPSLEY
          No need to hunt. There's someone
          here willing to save you.
          From the shadows: Madam Truska. Startlingly beautiful. She
          steps up. Eyes on Darren, she offers Crepsley her wrist.

                         MADAM TRUSKA
          By my own free will, Darren Shan.
          As Crepsley's fingernail hovers, ready to open a vein.
          Darren shakes his head. 'No'.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CREPSLEY
          Drink or you'll die.

                         DARREN
          No. I can't. I'm human.
          Crepsley releases Truska's arm.

                         CREPSLEY
          You're not! And you'll be nothing!
          Darren stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be.

                         DARREN
          I am human. In my heart I am.
          A great big TEAR rolls down Truska's cheek. That's the last
          thing Crepsley needed to see. He's defeated.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY SPACE - NIGHT

          People in their seats or taking them. Darren is back in his
          role as usher. He seats two people, wipes at the sweat
          beading on his forehead. He's getting sicker.
          He sees Debbie. She and Sam are already seated across the
          way. She smiles, waves. Darren forces a smile,, waves back.
          Looking for more patrons, Darren nearly walks into... A
          FIGURE. A hat pulled down obscures his face.

                         VOICE
          An usher in the house of usher.
          And I can't seem to find a seat.
          Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the aisle.

                         DARREN
          This way.
          Darren brings him down to a handful of seats. The figure
          looks up from under the brim of his hat. It's Mr. Tiny.

          MR. TINY
          Join me.

                         DARREN
          I don't think so.
          As Darren moves to go, Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his
          wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling Darren down beside him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          MR. TINY
          It's time we had a few moments.
          Folks involved in epic struggles
          should get to know each other.
          Darren doesn't answer.

          MR. TINY
          Has Crepsley told you about me?
          Explained me?

                         DARREN
          He said you can't be explained.
          You need to be experienced.

          MR. TINY
          He gives me too much credit.

                         DEBBIE
          Hey, Darren.
          Darren looks up to see Debbie and Sam. Oh no...

                         DEBBIE
          We're gonna sit on this side.

                         SAM
          Cuz we miss you so much.
          She digs Sam with her elbow. They sit just a row in front.

          MR. TINY

                         (WHISPERS)
          Choosing sides can only lead to
          trouble. Never, ever choose sides
          unless it's your own.

                         DARREN
          You've chosen the vampaneze.
          Mr. Tiny laughs, slaps his knee even.

          MR. TINY
          Is that really what you think? A
          smart boy like you?
          And the lights drop. A trumpet blasts and all is silent.

          ON THE STAGE
          The little people wheel out a CAGE. There's a gurgled GROWL.
          The little people retreat. Several audience members lean in,
          then SCREAM as the wolfman CRASHES to the front of the cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          A white spot shines down on Mr. Tall.

          MR. TALL
          Ladies and Gentlemen...

          DARREN & MR. TINY

          MR. TINY
          .subjugators and saps...

          MR. TALL
          Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
          are an ancient circus...
          As Mr. Tall drones on...

          MR. TINY
          Oh, his speeches are impossible.
          Mr. Tiny opens his free hand. His pocket watch melts up into
          view from his palm. Time begins to speed up around them.
          Mr. Tall's voice speeds to a BUZZ as he 'keystone cops' off
          the stage and Rhamus 'keystones' on. The audience's small
          movements become rattles and shakes.
          Only Darren and Mr. Tiny are at normal speed.

          MR. TINY
          I'm not so complicated, Darren.
          During war there are those who
          profit. A war between vampires and
          vampaneze would have terrible
          consequences. Therefore...

                         DARREN
          Terrible profits.

          MR. TINY
          Excellent. I am a profiteer. I
          exact fees and gains. I'm simple.
          On stage, Madam Truska exits and Evra 'keystones' through his
          performance with his snake.

          MR. TINY
          Did Crepsley tell you of the
          prophesy?

                         DARREN
          What prophesy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          MR. TINY
          They say the final battle between
          vampires and vampaneze will be
          decided by a child. That's why the
          vampires won't blood children. To
          avoid the end of the world.
          As these words are pondered by Darren...

          MR. TINY
          I think I underestimated you. I
          think you could be wonderful.

                         DARREN
          I think you're a creep. I think
          you suck.

          MR. TINY
          Too bad.
          Mr. Tiny closes his hand around the watch. Time returns to
          normal. The applause for Evra slowing down to normal speed.
          As he walks off the stage, Debbie looks back at Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          He was great!
          As she looks back to the stage someone sits on Darren's other
          side. Collar pulled up, head wrapped in a scarf. Murlough!

                         MURLOUGH
          (low; re: Debbie)
          Is it Dar-wren's girlfriend?

                         DARREN
          Forget about her --
          Murlough takes hold of Darren's other wrist. Still low:

                         MURLOUGH
          She has plenty of lovely blood
          inside. Inside, outside, hmmm?
          Darren struggles. Murlough pulls him close, HISSES in his
          ear, flashing those filthy teeth.

                         MURLOUGH
          I don't care about humans. I don't
          care about you. But the vampire -
          Larten Crepsley - him I care about.

                         (ALMOST SHY)
          Murlough is a vampire killer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          On stage: the spotlight hits Crepsley.

                         DARREN
          You guys are in trouble. There's
          more than one vampire now. Gavner
          Purl is here.
          Murlough reacts to the name. Does not like it.

                         MURLOUGH
          Have you seen Purl Gavner's face?
          Young Murlough sliced it for him.

          MR. TINY
          Darren, you're a liar. He's a
          thousand miles gone by now. And
          master Crepsley is right there.
          As he points at Crepsley...

                         CREPSLEY
          Holding Madam Octa's cage. Aware something's 'in the air'.

                         MURLOUGH
          Shimmers, phases into flit mode. Disappears.

                         DARREN
          Crepsley! Look out!
          The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa.
          Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny's
          hand around Darren's wrist.

                         STAGE
          As Murlough 'appears' alongside Crepsley.
          Madam Octa's cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks
          Crepsley fifteen feet through the air. He lands flat on his
          back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show.
          Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG
          KNIFE in either hand.
          Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE
          'switches' to life in his hand...

          DARREN & MR. TINY
          As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny switches his grip to the back
          of the boy's neck. That holds him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         STAGE
          CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long knives
          pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt.
          Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as
          it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect.
          From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It
          catches Murlough hard across the chops.

                         OFF STAGE
          Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do.

                         STAGE
          Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in
          Murlough's left hand with the one in his right.
          Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade
          dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face.
          Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over
          heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall.

                         DARREN
          Concentrating. Trying to flit.

                         STAGE
          Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus
          style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so
          brutish after all. He matches the move --
          Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley
          reacts, frozen in shock.

          DARREN & MR. TINY
          The audience around them unsure. Many shocked. It's part of
          the show, right? Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife
          to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing.
          And Mr. Tiny's holding nothing but air. Darren is gone.

          DARREN (FLIT WORLD)
          Speeding down to the stage. The dagger descends in slo-
          motion, but it's only a centimeter or two from it's target.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         STAGE
          Darren reappears, leaps onto Murlough's back, knocks him off
          target. As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers left.
          Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling,
          Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears.
          ROARING, Murlough grabs Darren. They disappear as well.

          MR. TINY
          Sighs. This is not how it's supposed to go. Sam and Debbie
          leave their seats, head for the stage.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLIT WORLD)

          Murlough with Darren in tow, looking high and low for
          Crepsley. Moving past the barely moving Mr. Tall and Evra.

          CREPSLEY (FLIT WORLD)
          His back to a wall. Trying to hold it together. Frozen
          PATRONS facing the exit beyond. As he'loses his flit power,
          the patrons suddenly resume real speed for the exits.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

          The old power plant. Pipes and catwalks. Murlough and
          Darren here. A chain hangs from the ceiling. Murlough lifts
          Darren, wraps it around his ankle. Hangs Darren upside down!

                         MURLOUGH

          CREPSLEY!

                         CUT TO:

                         CREPSLEY
          Reacting to Murlough's voice.

                         CUT TO:

          BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
          Murlough twists Darren's arm. Darren SCREAMS out in pain.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         EVRA
          Reacting as Debbie and Sam arrive. They move toward it.

                         CUT TO:

                         CREPSLEY
          Listening as the scream fades off. Clutching his stomach,
          Crepsley moves.

                         CUT TO:

          BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
          Murlough pulls Darren a little higher. They're face-to-face,
          though Darren is upsidedown.

                         MURLOUGH
          Crepsley will come for his
          assistant.

                         DARREN
          He doesn't care about me.

                         MURLOUGH
          Murlough has an assistant, too. A
          smart one, smarter than you.
          As Murlough says this, Darren looks past as stepping up,
          grinning, is Murlough's assistant.

                         DARREN
          Steve?
          Steve! Steve holds up his hands so Darren can see the WHITE
          SCAR on the tip of each finger. He gets closer.

                         STEVE
          Mr. Tiny made my dream come true.
          Only better. I'm half vampaneze
          instead of a stupid half vampire.
          Mr. Tiny says I have a destiny. He
          says he's gonna make sure of it.

                         DARREN
          Is that who you talked to? Was
          that the internet guy? Mr. Tiny?

                         STEVE

                         (LAUGHS)
          Pretty funny, huh? He introduced
          himself after you left town.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
          But, I think I've known him a long
          time in my head. In my bad, bad
          blood.
          Chilling. Maybe Steve is evil. He leans in even closer.

                         STEVE
          He gave me back the dream you
          stole.
          Murlough motions Steve quiet, slaps a hand over Darren's
          mouth. Listens. Smiles. Whispers.

                         MURLOUGH
          Crepsley comes.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. APPROACH PASSAGE - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Crepsley moving forward. Hurting. He slows, stops. As he
          looks back over his shoulder. Something's behind him.

          EVRA, DEBBIE & SAM
          Freeze as Crepsley looks back in the direction from which
          they follow. From their POV, Crepsley suddenly disappears.

                         SAM
          Where'd he go?
          They jump as Crepsley appears right in front of them.

                         CREPSLEY
          Evra... Get them out of here.

                         EVRA

                         BUT --
          Evra knows it's useless. As he nods, Crepsley turns and
          strides back toward where he had been.
          Sam and Debbie exchange a look. What the Hell?

                         EVRA
          You guys better go back.

                         SAM
          What are you gonna do?

                         EVRA
          Darren's my friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         DEBBIE
          Ours too.
          Sam's not so sure, but he nods in agreement.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Darren swings back and forth in long strokes like a pendulum,
          a rag stuffed in his mouth to silence him.

                         DARREN'S POV
          Sweeping the room. Wait! It fixes on a doorway. There's
          Crepsley. Looking about, everywhere but at Darren.

                         BOILER ROOM
          Crepsley speaks to 'the room'.

                         CREPSLEY
          I can smell it. Why does it hide?

                         (STEPPING UP)
          The vampire is here.
          WHUMP! Murlough drops from above. Lands ten feet in front
          of Crepsley. As they begin to arc around each other.

                         MURLOUGH
          The vampire will die.

                         STEVE'S VOICE

                         (FROM ABOVE)
          Let's get readyyyyy to rumble!
          Crepsley looks up, reacts.

                         CREPSLEY
          Even the creatures of the night
          watch too much TV.
          Darren swings past through the middle of it all.
          Murlough charges.
          Crepsley sidesteps Darren, decides to take the fight higher.
          He leaps up, swings himself up onto one of the catwalks.
          Murlough follows. They use the room steel as monkey bars as
          they climb, clash. Violent, quick attacks. Crepsley gaining
          a position, abandoning it as Murlough SLAMS in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         DARREN
          Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the battle now. He
          reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold,
          lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain.

                         EVRA
          Sam, unhook his legs.
          As Sam struggles, Debbie pulls the rag from Darren's mouth.

                         DARREN
          Are you guys nuts? Get outta here!

                         EVRA
          It's against our code.
          Suddenly unhooked, Darren hits the ground. He looks up at
          Evra who grins down at him.

                         EVRA
          Never leave a freak behind.

                         CUT TO:

                         CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE
          On the catwalks Murlough draws his knives. Crepsley jumps
          to the space he wants to defend, draws his own. Murlough
          counters. Two very serious predators'-at work. The animal
          kingdom at its killing best.
          A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley a matador. He redirects
          one of Murlough's arcing arms, smashing it against a metal
          housing. One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away.
          It's not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley's
          knife finds its way into Murlough's body. It enrages him,
          but Crepsley continues dealing out punishment.
          He's now like a brilliant counter-puncher, even as he
          inadvertently backs his way into a corner.
          But as quarters close in, Murlough's rage works to his
          advantage. He charges into Crepsley, his lowered shoulder
          sending Crepsley through the air and into...
          And through a BRICK WALL. Into the thin air outside! Still
          raging, Murlough nearly falls through himself. Instead, he
          slips, drops about twenty feet down inside the building!

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT

          Crepsley falls sixty feet, lands flat on his back, as brick
          and concrete rain on top of him...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

          As Evra pulls Darren along. Debbie and Sam riding shotgun.

                         EVRA
          Come on!

                         DARREN
          Evra. I think I'm dying.
          He looks horrible.

                         DEBBIE
          Let's carry him if we have to.
          Evra and Sam support him on either side. They continue,
          start across part of a darkened backstage area.
          A dark rectangular shape looms ahead. We hear a GUTTURAL
          GROWL, sees eyes glow in the gloom. They freeze.

                         EVRA
          It's okay. It's the wolfman. He's
          in his cage.
          They move forward again, the cage becomes visible. But
          another SHAPE beside it. Steve. He sets his hand on the
          cage's heavy latch. He's going to open it.

                         EVRA
          No don't!

                         STEVE
          Ooops...
          Steve lifts the latch. Even he doesn't expect the force the
          wolfman hits the door with. Whaanngg! It's out.
          Evra steps bravely forward. The wolfman sends him flying.
          Sam can't hold Darren up by himself. He doesn't even see the
          Wolfman leap over. As Darren sinks to the floor...
          The wolfman tears into Sam...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         DEBBIE
          Reacts in horror.

                         STEVE
          He's more surprised than shocked. Until the wolfman looks
          his way. Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the
          dark. The wolfman turns back toward Debbie.
          She backs away, takes off up a rickety stairway. The wolfman
          HOWLS, then follows.
          Darren's too weak to follow, near tears in frustration and
          regret. He watches after them, then he looks over at Sam.
          Sam who is dying. Just a few feet away. His eyes flicker to
          Darren's. He tries to say something, but can't.

                         DARREN
          Oh Sam. Oh no...
          Darren crawls over, takes Sam's bloody hand.

                         SAM
          Go save Debbie, Darren...
          Sam manages the smallest smile. As his eyes drift shut...

                         SAM
          I think she loves you...
          From above, we hear Debbie SCREAM. Darren considers Sam's
          blood, knows what he has to do. Leave his humanity behind
          and cross the line. He needs to drink Sam's blood.

                         DARREN
          Forgive me, Sam, but I need
          strength. I need blood.
          As Darren extends his nails over Sam's wrist...

                         DARREN
          We're going to save her together.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Debbie backing into a corner. The wolfman almost on her...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          Murlough arrives! Pure animal action as he tears into
          wolfie, sends him retreating, licking his wounds into the
          darkness. Murlough heaves for breath, pretty beat up
          himself. And here comes Steve. Cautiously.

                         STEVE
          Is Crepsley dead?

                         MURLOUGH
          Who knows? Young Murlough lives,
          but he's hurt.

                         STEVE
          What can I do?

                         MURLOUGH
          What can Dar-wren's girlfriend do?
          We need to get the blood inside
          outside. Don't we?
          Then we hear it: a blood-curdling scream filters up. It's:

          DARREN! - BACKSTAGE AREA
          He's drunk Sam's blood. He rises. His sickness wicking off
          him. Strength descending. Empowered. Furious. He screams
          again, the sound taking shape into words.

                         DARREN

          FORGIVE ME!!!

          FACTORY STAGE SPACE
          The audience who haven't left react as the chilling sound
          reaches them.

          BACKSTAGE AREA - FACTORY
          Fully 1/2 vampire powered, he takes the stairs two at a time.

                         UPPER FLOOR
          Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles as Darren arrives.

                         DARREN
          Let her go.

                         STEVE
          Stop being a big shot. This isn't
          like stopping some fight at school.

                         DARREN
          Shut up, Steve.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Murlough's eyes go very, very dark. He attacks.
          Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over.
          Knocked in a heap.
          Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going
          to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's
          pretty powerful himself.
          Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings
          his fist in a vicious arc.
          Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right
          through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.
          Murlough's getting tired of Darren.

                         MURLOUGH
          You need to stand still so you can
          die.
          But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't.
          He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain.
          Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall
          smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
          Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.

                         FACTORY SPACE
          The audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They
          react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage.

          UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY
          Crepsley brings up his knife.
          Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand.
          With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him
          hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We
          can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat.
          But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He
          drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART!
          Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at
          Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
          Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back,
          falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking
          Crepsley with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         FACTORY SPACE
          SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in
          mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the
          center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead.
          As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them.

                         UPPER FLOOR
          But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie,
          pushes her to the edge where the rafters are.

                         STEVE
          Stay back! Or I'll throw her off!
          I mean it!
          It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie.
          She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS.
          Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice.
          But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter.
          Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she
          deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor.
          Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them:
          rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping
          station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale.

                         DARREN
          It's over, Steve.

                         STEVE
          Is it?
          Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling
          but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will
          be their last. They separate, try to gain position.

                         STEVE
          You wanna hear something funny?
          After your funeral, I went to see
          your parents.
          They continue circling.

                         STEVE
          And they were fine. They acted
          like they barely remembered you.

                         DARREN
          Liar.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Darren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the
          head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling.

                         STEVE

                         (SMILES)
          And your sister. She was moving
          into your room. They had a yard
          sale. I bought some of your stuff.
          Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly:

                         DARREN
          Did you steal money from my mom's
          purse?

                         STEVE
          What?

                         DARREN
          Did you?
          Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious.

                         STEVE
          Why do you ask? Is knowing that
          gonna help you rest in peace?

                         DARREN
          No. It's just practically the last
          thing that ever happened between me
          and my dad was I was arguing with
          him.

                         STEVE

                         (FLIP)
          Least you had a dad to argue with.
          A fury building in Darren.

                         DARREN
          I was telling him he was wrong
          about you. That's the last time we
          had together. Fighting about you.

                         STEVE
          Hate to tell ya. Your dad was
          right. How do you think we got the
          money for the dumb tickets? I took
          it. Just like I'm gonna take you.
          Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs
          on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,
          no matter how many times Steve hits him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          WHAM! Darren lets Steve have it.

                         DARREN
          I miss him.

          WHAM!

                         DARREN
          Do you understand?

          WHAM!

                         DARREN
          I miss him so much.
          WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over.
          But just as he pitches off the end rafter...
          Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he
          hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will
          fall into the spikes below.
          Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do.

                         CREPSLEY
          Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you
          won't have to do it later.
          Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever.

                         DARREN

                         (SOFTLY; SADLY)
          No. He used to be my friend.
          Darren flings Steve back the other way. To safety.

                         DARREN
          Start running. Don't ever stop.
          Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren
          starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate.

                         STEVE
          Next time...
          And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark.
          Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.

                         DEBBIE
          Sam?
          Darren shakes his head. Sam didn't make it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          She understands. Darren looks at Crepsley. He's a mess.

                         DARREN
          Are you gonna be okay?

                         CREPSLEY
          I just need to catch my breath.
          For a few days. Maybe a week.

                         DARREN
          You think I made a mistake, don't
          you?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. I think that you proved
          yourself human after all.
          Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.

                         DARREN
          Half human. What now?

                         CREPSLEY
          What do you mean?

                         DARREN
          There's a war on, isn't there?
          Crepsley shrugs.

                         DARREN
          This world is crossed by fences.
          You have to decide which side you
          stand on.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, yes. Black and white fences
          crossing very gray fields.

                         DARREN
          It's not gray. I've met the bad
          guys. They need to be stopped.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm not sure it's my fight.

                         DARREN
          But you said it. There's no in
          between. And the power of being
          alone is never going to be greater
          than the weakness. It's our fight.

                         CUT TO:

          As PATRONS try to get as far as they can as quick as they
          can. We see Steve duck out, blending in.
          Mr. Tiny's Lincoln Continental pulls up. As Steve gets in...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NEAR THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

          Mr. Tall, Evra, Debbie, Darren and Crepsley. Crepsley sets
          Sam's body down in the grass. It's covered with one of Madam
          Truska's tent silks. As Crepsley's eyes meet Darren's...

                         DARREN

                         (A WHISPER)
          He was a good kid. It's weird, but
          I remember things about him even
          though I wasn't there when they
          happened. Even though it's
          impossible.
          A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy.

                         CREPSLEY
          His blood is in you.

          MR. TALL
          I'll deal with the police when they
          come. What I'll say, I don't know.

                         DEBBIE
          Say what happened. Some crazy guy
          showed up. Sam was in the wrong
          place at the wrong time.
          They're all quiet a moment.

                         EVRA
          He was brave.

                         DEBBIE

                         (SADLY)
          For the only time in his life.

                         DARREN
          He didn't die in vain.
          A beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

          MR. TALL
          Time to fly or flit or whatever you
          call it. The sun won't wait all
          night.

                         CREPSLEY
          Actually, that's exactly what it
          does.
          Mr. Tall manages a smile, considers the sky a moment.

          MR. TALL
          Time will tell what this night has
          brought us.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes. Keep my coffin ready, would
          you?

          MR. TALL
          Always.
          As they exchange farewells, Debbie turns to Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          Do you think we'll meet again?

                         DARREN
          You never know.
          As she hugs him tight, she whispers in his ear:

                         DEBBIE
          I hope so...

                         DARREN

                         (WHISPERS BACK)
          Hope is a good word. I hope so,
          too.
          And so goodbye. Darren and Crepsley start down the road.

                         DARREN
          Where are we going?

                         CREPSLEY
          To meet the Vampire Generals. War
          clouds are forming. A storm is
          coming. And I have a feeling
          you're needed much more than I am.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         DARREN
          So what are we waiting for? Let's
          go.
          Crepsley offers his hand.

                         CREPSLEY
          Take my arm.
          Darren shakes his head, doesn't need it.
          He shimmers, flits into the night.
          Crepsley laughs to himself. As he follows...

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. ALLEYWAY (VILLAGE) - DUSK

          Gloomy, last light. From out of the shadows comes            --
          A DOG. A dog of war. Big, mangy, muscular, scary. As
          he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly
          choked with fallen structures. and signs of tumult.

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DUSK

          TRACKING WITH THE DOG as he comes onto a battlefield.
          The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY --                

          SERIES OF SHOTS
          as the Dog traverses a landscape of --
          BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was
          furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
          nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
          Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes
          are sad, his expression weary and disgusted.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - NIGHT

          The entrance is patrolled by a dozen PALACE GUARDS. They     
          don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace    
          wall and disappear inside.                                   

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT HALL - NIGHT             

          Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are               
          disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound
          pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to --    
          KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome     
          face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands      
          the room --                                                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Now we end the debate about
          tactics... and begin to plan for
          victory.

          AT THE BACK OF THE HALL
          The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - NIGHT

          Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs.     

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - ROYAL APARTMENT - CORRIDOR -


                         NIGHT
          The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the         
          shadows.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - BEDCHAMBER - DOG'S POV -


                         NIGHT
          In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of QUEEN DANAE as a     
          LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen's       
          perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting
          leaves.
          The Dog's eyes. He moves forward.

                         FLOOR-LEVEL
          TRACKING WITH the Dog's legs as they MORPH INTO HUMAN
          LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure,
          who roughly pulls a curtain aside.                            
          In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased.

                         QUEEN DANAE
          My King! Has the strategy been
          set so quickly?

                         REVERSE ANGLE
          The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius,          
          including the distinctive scar. He regards her hungrily.      

                         QUEEN DANAE
          Come to your Queen, my King.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - SUNRISE          

          The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with         
          AIDES and Guards. Suddenly, the King stops.

                         CONTINUED:
          On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged
          creature -- and now it appears:
          The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the
          men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power.
          Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
          raise their weapons.
          The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes     
          close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the      
          shadows below.

          HARDENED COUNTENANCE - DAY
          staring at --

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Queen Danae, PREGNANT NOW, and weeping. Her arms are
          bound.
          A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women weep, the men       
          agonize.                                                     
          Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it       
          closed. On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest     
          to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory.
          WE SEE in his face what the others do not -- shame and
          doubt.                                                       
          IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights itself and rides out    
          on the tide.                                                 

          EXT. SAND DUNES OF A LONELY BEACH - NIGHT                    

          Two HORSEMEN gallop in the moonlight. The first Rider
          sways in the saddle and falls from his mount. He
          staggers to his feet, a skin of ale in his hands. It is
          King Acrisius, very drunk.
          The second Rider, the King's STEWARD, dismounts to give      
          aid, though he's also drunk.

          This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about                    
          fearlessly.

          He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes

          so that Zeus will know I

          The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in

          ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight,        
          arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly --

          MISSHAPEN DISFIGUREMENT.
          And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS!
          The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR and
          the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward. He
          SCREAMS, but it's too late -- the huge CREATURE grabs him
          by the neck and LIFTS HIM OUT OF FRAME. From the empty,
          moonlit dunes, we...

          A LITTLE BOY leads a blind OLD MAN along a road.             
          Abruptly, the Old Man halts. Puzzled, the Boy scans
          ahead, SEES --
          -- a SPRAY OF DUST, moving fast, behind a blurred BLACK

                         FORM --                                                      
          -- in an instant, the apparition blows past them -- wind
          and dust whip at them. In awe and fear --

          Thoth the Quick...

          Messenger of the Gods. Bound for
          Olympos.
          The rushing Black Form crosses a field, leaving a            
          violent wave in the long grass and suddenly --

          EXT. FIELDS/WOODS/MOUNTAIN/OLYMPOS - DAY

          WE ARE IN THAT RUSHING POV: the landscape is just a          
          blur. But up ahead is a mountain: OLYMPOS. WE ZOOM UP        
          TO the summit --                                             
          -- INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist --
          villas, classical facades: THE ABODE OF THE GODS. The
          polished stone of the grandest villa reflects THOTH'S
          dark form touching down.

          THOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape
          billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the
          center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging --
          -- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter...
          THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted
          ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled
          and lose count.
          Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic,       
          bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm.      

                         THOTH
          My lord.

          We have debated, we have voted,
          and it is decided. We offer the
          Humans peace. Thoth, you will
          take them the terms of a treaty --

          TIAMAT                                                     (O.S.)

                         (SCORNFULLY)
          A treaty!
          Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are
          familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog.
          In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE
          Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made    
          visible, and --                                             
          -- TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, the only God fearless         
          enough to challenge Zeus' rule --                           

                         TIAMAT
          We don't negotiate with them! We
          dictate to them. Their place is
          to beg. They have forgotten their
          role and have denied us the
          sustenance of their prayers.

                         APHRODITE
          Our mercy will give them reason to
          be grateful. They will bow down
          and whisper our names with more
          passion than before.

                         TIAMAT
          They will bow down when we snap
          their backs! Mercy? We are Gods!
          Some of us remember that and are
          not afraid --
          Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to
          the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage.               

                         ZEUS
          Silence! Or learn what it is to
          be afraid! The debate is over,
          the votes cast...
          Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of
          alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian.

          to enter their affairs.

                         SET
          And if they refuse our terms?

                         ZEUS
          They have suffered terrible
          losses. They will not pass up a
          chance for peace.

          Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown                           
          weaker than I knew.
          Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks
          up the two black shards representing their votes. He
          hands one to Tiamat.                                       

                         SET

          We will manage these thick-witted

          (off his look)
          Yes, we will be bound by great

          You are correct, Your Highness, I

                         THOTH
          Zeus above all. He has so long
          desired the tragedy end, he made a                         
          plan that began twenty-five years
          ago.

          Twenty-five years! How is that

          Amoun winces at her tone. Thoth sends a scary glance her

          EXT. THE AGORA OF JOPPA - DAY

          The market, now quiet, tries to return to normalcy. But     
          the crowd watches the Basilica, worried by the God's        
          presence.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

          Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit stunned. Amoun watches
          without surprise.

                         KEPHEUS
          A treaty marriage?

                         THOTH
          You have a daughter of age.

          Andromeda!

                         KEPHEUS
          Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal
          father to give his daughter to a
          God.

                         THOTH
          No. Such a union would be
          unclean. Years ago Zeus created a                           
          scion of mixed blood. Half-man,
          half-God. Bred for just this
          union. That is how important Zeus
          considers this truce.

                         AMOUN
          Majesty, if I may -- the young man
          does exist. He lives in a small
          fishing village on the isle of                         
          Seriphos.
          Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.

                         KEPHEUS
          You knew about this and said
          nothing?

                         (ACCUSATORY)

                         AMOUN
          My Queen, I serve only the great
          order of things. I was the boy's
          tutor years ago.

                         KEPHEUS
          How haughty this boy must be, who                      
          knows he is half-God.

                         AMOUN
          He knows nothing and believes
          himself an ordinary man. He has
          never left his village. He can be                      
          overconfident, but it is from                          
          inexperience, not arrogance.                           
          Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply

          What assurance do we have that our                     
          daughter will be safe?

          Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL
          SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for
          a solid handhold, frightened.
          The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and
          pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward
          Thoth.

          Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the          
          table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT

          Perfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface.                                                            
          A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's       
          net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can.        
          As the net passes we see --
          ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in    
          the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When
          they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the
          blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look

                         AT --
          PERSEUS,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw,
          a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace
          of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man.

          Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net
          near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through
          the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus
          hangs on.
          One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net,
          bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls
          Anteros toward the surface.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          A CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail.
          SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony.
          Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend
          in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus
          is mad with despair. They have to pull him away.
          Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one
          survivor.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          Spyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits
          alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence.
          Then, gruffly --

                         SPYROS
          Your grieving does Anteros no
          good. It comforts only you.

                         PERSEUS
          It's my fault he's gone.

                         SPYROS
          He was careless with the net.
          Perseus gives him a hard look.

                         PERSEUS
          So it's his fault. Not mine, not
          fate, not the Gods?

                         SPYROS

                         (DISDAINFULLY)
          The Gods delude themselves about
          their power and watch in envy

          die in my arms. I made it back,

          Have you not noticed?

                         PERSEUS
          To what purpose? I failed him.

                         (SCOFFS)
          Purpose! Looking for purpose is
          what ensnares men in the
          superstition of the Gods, as
          surely as your friend was caught
          in that net. And all the
          searching leads down to the same
          place.
          The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
          Perseus looks off at the rocky coast. Collects himself,

                         PERSEUS
          You always say that my abilities
          are greater than other men's. But
          they were not enough to save him.

                         SPYROS
          You are still a man, confined by
          man's limits. You are just as
          likely to fail as succeed.

                         PERSEUS
          How is that greater than other
          men?

                         SPYROS
          Ordinary men fail most of the
          time.
          The trawler rounds a point on the island.
          Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer

                         LOOK --
          A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe         
          figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias.      
          Young yet ancient. THE WILTING GIRL.

           from the modest stone dwelling. She sees his mood and

          Perseus, why are you so sad?
          This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up    
          and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they

          Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.

                         MARMARA
          At the beginning of time, when Man
          was young, he prayed to the Gods.
          His belief in the Gods gave his
          life meaning. It was a good

          Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty      
          electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is    
          oddly faded, washed-out.                                    

                         PERSEUS

          It was not the boat I was

          Yes, of service. I need you to
          come with me on a journey.
          Perseus gives her a look.

                         PERSEUS
          Right now?
          (as she nods)
          It wouldn't take much persuading
          to get me to leave this village,
          but tonight is impossible. My
          family can't wake and find me
          gone. Where do you want me to go?

                         WILTING GIRL
          It's not what I want. I am in the

          For what?
          Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry
          between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a
          swarm, racing toward him.
          He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
          climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
          stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and
          falls.

          A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat
          swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits
          quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering.

          We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping
          in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
          slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are
          bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be
          healing as we look at them.

          I had a dream. I fell into a dark

          Andromeda freezes at her mother's voice, stops Agenor,
          finger to her lips.
          He ignores her, starts again. Andromeda does something       
          below the frame that jolts him off. The girl can take        
          care of herself.

          A SQUEAL and WHISPERING from the closet stops Cassiopeia.    
          She throws a perturbed glance at the door. Peshet looks      
          guilty.

          Perseus can't take his eyes off the Wilting Girl, who            
          steers. She tries not to be self-conscious; she would            
          blush were she not so pale.

                         WILTING GIRL
          You're looking in the wrong
          direction.

          I don't think so.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Perhaps you should give some
          thought to your immediate future.

                         PERSEUS

          Maybe you should take another
          look...
          She indicates the view behind him. Perseus turns, jaw        
          dropping.

                         HIS POV
          A breathtaking view of Joppa -- a city in two parts.
          At sea level, tangled hovels, boats, and docks crowd the
          working-class area -- the LOWER WHARF.
          Above, twisting stone stairs climb the cliffs to the
          ACROPOLIS with its gleaming villas, temples, statues, and
          colonnaded towers, hugging the precipice.

          The Wilting Girl leads Perseus through the city. He's
          never seen anything like it. He rubbernecks, awestruck

          the coals and fashions armor by pounding the white-hot
          scales over a mold.

           homeless refugees on the street and the ruins   of once-

          . before I am a king or a
          peacemaker, I am a father. Do you

          I'm not sure, Your Highness. I

          I take no comfort in that, young

          Not even a little, my lord. It's

                         KEPHEUS
          Where does a young person get such
          ideas?

                         PERSEUS
          Perhaps from my adopted father,
          sir. I admire him greatly, and he
          believes in little he cannot hold
          in his hand.

                         KEPHEUS                                                   
          Is he a scholar?

          No, Your Highness, a fisherman.                           

          AMOUN (O.S.)
          I know this mentor who so
          influences young Perseus.
          Amoun has silently entered the chamber. Perseus reacts    
          in amazement.

                         PERSEUS
          Master Amoun!
          He hurries over to the older man, who embraces him
          warmly.

          Perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds Amoun at
          arm's length.

                         PERSEUS
          What are you doing here?

          I am honored to serve the King as                         
          an advisor. His Magi Strategos.

                         PERSEUS
          From my village tutor to Magi
          Strategos... What a path!
          The King's patience is exhausted. To Cassiopeia

                         KEPHEUS
          Where is Andromeda? At the least,
          the two should meet before
          tomorrow's ceremony...

          Tomorrow? Is the wedding so soon?

                         CASSIOPEIA
          The wedding comes later. Tomorrow
          we will have the public
          announcement.

                         AMOUN
          And a celebration of the treaty.
          A Page enters and whispers in Kepheus' ear. Kepheus is    
          irritated.                                                

                         KEPHEUS
          It seems our Andromeda has
          wandered away.
          Cassiopeia reacts, upset.

                         AMOUN
          Perhaps the thought of her new
          life has made her frantic to enjoy
          the vestiges of her old one.

          Perseus, if you're to take the

          good time to start your training.
          Go into the city and retrieve her.

          How will I know her?

                         CASSIOPEIA
          She is unmistakable.

          I'm a stranger here. Any hints?

          The Wilting Girl slips into the dusk like a thief.          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - MAGIC HOUR

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.
          She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
          gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Zeus?
          Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an
          intimate way -- a beautiful sound.

          Why do we have to play these
          games, my lovely girl? You know
          you cannot leave.
          The vines retract, freeing her. She rubs where they
          gripped her.

                         WILTING GIRL
          My part is finished.

          I still believe in you. Close
          your eyes and see your tomorrow.
          She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. A single
          tear runs along her cheek. She opens her eyes.

                         WILTING GIRL
          It's too painful. I can't involve
          myself.

          EXT. STREETS OF JOPPA - MAGIC HOUR

          Perseus roams, taking in the city with interest. Rich        
          and poor mix in the crowded streets. As always, the poor     
          have suffered the most from the conflict.

          Perseus follows the MUSIC and the sound of LAUGHTER to a
          crowded terrace overlooking the sea. Upper class YOUNG
          PEOPLE are partying en masse.
          Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl,    
          testing his instincts. Suddenly, he stops in his tracks,     
          looking off --

          Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her
          sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends.
          Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane.
          A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN embraces her. She gives him a
          deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the
          crush.

          EXT. BALUSTRADE - MAGIC HOUR

          Andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset.
          The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture
          stops him cold.

          Very beautiful.
          Andromeda spins, petulant.

          Will you please give me some

                         PEACE --
          The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause.

          What did you say?

                         PERSEUS
          I said, 'Very beautiful.'

          intimate judgements on the royal
          family?

          I meant the sunset.
          She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.       

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you always start a seduction
          with an insult?
          Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
          at the sea.

                         PERSEUS
          I know nothing of seduction. I'm
          a simple fisherman. My home is
          across that water.

          Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad
          mix of emotions crosses her face.

          EXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT

          Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays
          close, attracted to him.

                         ANDROMEDA
          It's not personal. You're not a
          bad-looking boy.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          I'm too young. I don't want to be
          married.

                         PERSEUS
          Me either.

          No one asked me. And now that
          I've met you, I don't know if I
          can go through with it.
          (off her look)                                              
          It's not personal. Seeing you
          makes it real. I think a man
          should make his own decisions. I
          won't be the pawn of a King or a                            
          God.
          She looks at him with new interest.

          Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.

          That doesn't mean we can't be
          friends. Get to know each other.
          I want to show you something.
          She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT

          Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly         
          around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at
          her excitement.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm already lost.

          I'll take care of you.
          They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd
          sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what
          could be mistaken for a bed.

                         ANDROMEDA
          This is my special place. No one
          can see or hear or even find us
          now.

          without your aid.

          Do you want to?
          When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and
          gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles
          it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things
          down, holding her at bay.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you not find me attractive?

          True. Maybe a lot of girls look

          What if we find we're very compat--
          She stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender
          to his desire, but again, he stops. Her voice is a low

          (makes a face)
          It seems what everyone wants to
          believe.
          Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.

          (as Perseus laughs)
          But let's find out for sure...
          She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of    
          foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall
          into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their
          bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for
          only a moment, her voice husky --

          Perseus wakes on the bed of foliage, looks around.
          Andromeda is gone. He thinks, smiles. Then he remembers

          Perseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor,
          moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room
          is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits
          on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her.

          You're late.

          The room QUIETS as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of     
          the dais with a cup of wine, not her first.

                         CASSIOPEIA
          I won't be long-winded. You all
          know I am a modest person, no
          matter my rank.
          Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her
          mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus,
          watching from his throne.

          Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal

          Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would

          and the low-lying shanties.                                 

          INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Cassiopeia lies blank and wan. A LOW DRONE grows.           
          Kepheus rushes to the window. And then, a deep, EARTH-      
          SHATTERING BELLOW from the creature. The room SHUDDERS.     

                         KEPHEUS
          Leviathan awakes...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          INT. BASILICA - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          A figure passes by a window in silhouette -- Andromeda
          steals through the shadows toward the Throne Room.

          INT. BALCONY ABOVE THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Andromeda edges into position to see the room below.

          AMOUN (O.S.)
          . Leviathan -- First dweller of
          the deep. Hewn by Tiamat from the
          dark blood of the earth...

                         HER POV
          A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before
          Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus    
          stands off to the side.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Amoun reads from a scroll.                                

                         AMOUN
          . All monsters of the sea are                             
          but shadows of Leviathan the
          Kraken -- colossal, rapacious, and                        
          nigh indestructible.
          The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he      
          looks exhausted.                                          

                         KEPHEUS
          My Queen lies near death. Am I                            
          now to choose between the survival
          of our state... and the life of                           
          Andromeda, my only child?                                 
          Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group,
          expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an
          observer.

          The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence.         
          Perseus, uncertainly --                                   

                         PERSEUS
          I know that I am young and have
          not seen much of the world, but it
          seems to me that nothing is
          indestructible.
          The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.

          I am far from young and have seen
          much of the world... and I agree
          with my son.
          Everyone turns to the new arrival: Perseus' adoptive               
          father, Spyros. Perseus goes to embrace him.                       

                         PERSEUS
          Father, how did you find me?

                         KEPHEUS
          I thought this boy's father was a
          God. How does a stranger walk
          unmolested into the Throne Room of
          the King?

                         AMOUN
          I sent for him, Lord. This good                           
          man raised Perseus from infancy.                          
          He will help him now.

          With whatever is needed...

          He will help me destroy Leviathan.
          Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: "Yeah, okay,
          sure."

          Majesty, we can seek the counsel
          of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia.
          They know the hidden ways of the                      
          Gods. If Leviathan can be slain,
          they'll know how to do it.

          an authority much greater than I.
          Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many      
          skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking --      

                         PERSEUS
          Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence
          you came into my life as tutor, so
          long ago, and now, once again you
          instruct me.

                         AMOUN

                         (LAUGHS)
          No matter what you believe,
          Porpoise, some things are fated.
          I've been looking forward to this
          journey for a long, long time.
          He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back
          beside Perseus.

                         SPYROS
          Who would have thought we'd be on
          a journey like this? Two simple
          fishermen.

          I'm afraid I've dragged you into
          real danger, Father, when I have
          little idea of what I'm doing.

                         SPYROS
          Living at the mercy of the sea so
          long has convinced me some
          adventures are unexpected and some
          dangers unavoidable. It's all in
          your attitude.

                         PERSEUS
          What's our attitude about                                   
          destroying Leviathan?

          Tiamat's Palace-Galleon is bigger than anything man can
          construct. Tiamat is at the prow of the vessel, using

          INT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Tiamat's storm is pounding Joppa. LIGHTNING stabs          
          through the dark clouds. RAIN POUNDS the tiles outside
          Andromeda's lavish bedroom.
          Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed,    
          distressed.

          A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her,

          The sound of that same DISTANT THUNDER as the Expedition

          Perseus and the Wilting Girl ride side by side. Perseus

          Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His
          expression changes, and the tenor of this stolen vigil is
          altered.
          RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts
          the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and

          -- KALIBOS!                                                

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST - DAY                                    

           Only a few streaks of sunlight penetrate the canopy of      
          tall cedars.                                               

           SUPERIMPOSE: THE CEDAR FOREST OF THE ILLYRIAN BORDER...
           24 DAYS REMAINING

           Here slumbers an enormous hybrid creature with human        
           features and a leathery, scaled hide -- HUMBABA.            
          Suddenly, Set the Void appears. The evil God strokes the    
          sleeping monster's head, then reaches inside Humbaba's      
          skull. The animal goes stiff; its leg twitches.

                         SET
          Hear me, my pet. Let my
          instructions be seared to your
          primal mind as natural law.

                        L
          The monster's eyes shoot open; its pupils shrink to
          pinpoints.

          You are starving. Your gut says
          you'll soon perish. No earthly
          meat will still that hunger. What
          you need, what you ache for, is
          the flesh of... a demigod!

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - DAY

          Nearby, the Expedition (minus Abas) rests. Not here:
          Perseus, Draco, Icos, and Boreas.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY

          A herd of winged horses, PEGASSI, graze.
          Draco, Boreas, Icos and Perseus  -- thrilled -- hide in a
          thicket.

                         DRACO
          Pegassi, stallions of the Gods.

                         ICOS
          Perseus. How long do you think
          you could stay on one of those?
          Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look.        

                         BOREAS
          Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man
          can ride a Pegasus.

                         ICOS
          Did not Bellerophon tame the Great
          White Pegasus?

                         BOREAS
          You're right. But he was a                  
          demigod...

                         (EAGER)
          Then this will be a good way to
          find out just what I am.

                         DRACO
          Stop it, rogues. One of our own
          has disappeared without a trace
          and all you can think is to cause
          mischief. What if Perseus is
          bucked to his death from a
          thousand feet up?

          Don't worry, Commander, the boy
          won't even get on its back.
          With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him     
          back down.                                                   

                         DRACO
          Don't do this. If we go back to
          camp right now, we can avoid
          trouble and keep our goal in
          sight. A true leader will not be
          distracted.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun
          is. I'm too young to start
          avoiding trouble.
          Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking     
          soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,              
          buffeting Perseus with gusts.
          The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It       
          lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus     
          face-first into the dirt.
          Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
          dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the
          clearing.

                         BOREAS
          I'll collect him right now,
          Commander.
          Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL.       
          The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and       
          swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air,         
          homing in on Perseus.                                        

                         DRACO
          Perseus, get out of there! Icos,                             
          fetch the others.                                            
          Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with     
          swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus        
          does the same.                                               

                         DRACO
          I told you to run, boy. You'll

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - DAY

          Hearing the ROARS, the Expedition is already up. Icos       
          arrives.                                                    

                         ICOS
          A Humbaba!                                                  
          Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the woods; the others        
          follow.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY

          The reinforcements arrive to see Humbaba pin Boreas with    
          its talons.                                                 

                         DRACO
          Boreas!
          Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips      
          off Boreas' head and swallows his body.                     
          Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword          
          swinging.                                                   

                         AMOUN                                                       
          No, Perseus!                                                

                         VIDALIA                                                     
          Get back!                                                   
          Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling-
          bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster
          and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT

          HOOK.
          Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the     
          fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire       
          and metal.                                                  
          The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and          
          swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one      
          leg, but has it ripped from his hands.                      

                         VIDALIA
          A delusion is planted in its mind.
          It thinks it's starving and it
          wants to feed on --

          58.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces    
          its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's
          mouth with his saber.

                         VIDALIA
          I can't reverse the powerful
          curse. But if the monster's
          hungry, I can feed it.
          Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of
          CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight       
          into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake      
          them away, Mongke is thrown clear.                           

                         VIDALIA

                         (TO DRACO)
          Now! The belly! Slash the belly!
          Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges
          and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same
          moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss
          each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others
          are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple
          entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES

          TO THE GROUND.
          The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake
          the viscera from their feathers and take flight.

          EXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - STREAM - DAY

          Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms
          and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him,
          furious.

                         L-

                         VIDALIA
          I should cast a spell upon you and
          leave you forever a stone upon
          this stream.

                         PERSEUS
          I didn't beckon the Humbaba.

                         VIDALIA
          You did, with your childish
          recklessness, and Boreas has paid
          the price!
          Perseus, already rife with guilt, is stung by the truth.

          Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.

          Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who

          didn't you? When you came to our
          village?

                         AMOUN
          Your birth was written in the
          stars. I sought you out and took
          it as my cause to teach you.

                         PERSEUS
          You chose a poor student. I have
          learned little and my mistakes
          cost dearly.

          repulsive CLOSEUP -- Kalibos. (There, within his
          frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we
          noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form.)
          When his twisted body has gained purchase, he looks up

          Several Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the
          IRRESISTIBLE FRAGRANCE of the Lotus flowers. They pluck
          petals and chew them.
          The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to
          take their fill of the drug.
          Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from

          Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on
          Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and
          throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no
          Andromeda. Peshet races out.

          CITIZENS like a cat, peering under each hood, searching      
          for her mistress.

          On the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees. Fantasos, the      
          Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by         
          BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems      
          to have actual hypnotic powers.                              

                         FANTASOS

          Where is your mighty King? Safely
          cloistered above the flood... on
          the high ground, with the high-
          born -- the privileged gentry!...
          The angry crowd responds, fists shaking. Peshet moves
          through the throng, desperately looking for Andromeda.
          She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers
          her presence.

          . Does Kepheus worry about you?
          No! Only the Princessa... And
          still, the Kraken comes! Does the
          King build his defenses at the
          water's edge?
          "NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself
          replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor
          to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the
          stage.

                         AGENOR
          No! He makes his stand at his
          daughter's chamber door!... We
          will show Kepheus we're not
          sacrificial fodder. We will
          tremble the walls of his Basilica!
          RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly,

          at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches        
          from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.

          A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is

          One night soon, a gong will sound
          three times. When you hear it,
          unlock the back gate of the
          Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's

          (hands her a dagger)
          . and bring the Princess out.
          My men will take her to Leviathan.
          Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.

          Peshet, do you understand how

          The Expedition moves through a mountain pass. Perseus
          eyes a cliff. Amoun and Draco stop. Glimpses of CLOAKED
          FIGURES in the boulders.

                         AMOUN
          You wanted to know about Djinn
          Raiders. Here they are.

          Vidalia warily eyes the carpet of magenta flowers.         

                         VIDALIA
          The Alkali Lotus...
          She stops, spotting something in the distance. Kosmo
          pulls up.

          The Expedition enters the abandoned camp. They look        
          around in dismay.

          Spyros HEARS something and follows the SOUND to a tent,
          weapon ready.

          INT. TENT - DAY

          Spyros looks inside. A cauldron BUBBLES over a fresh
          fire. ALKALI LOTUS blossoms bob on the boiling broth.
          Spyros, uneasy, backs out.

          Draco, tell me what this --
          Everyone is standing perfectly still.                       
          DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion    
          lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers     
          they were is their armor.. Now they're monstrous            
          creatures: LOTOPHAGI.

          CLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT                                    
          as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands          
          beside it -- completely different. TILT UP TO: Kalibos.     
          Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters.           
          Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs       
          the air around Perseus.

          Lotophagi. Lotus-eaters. We

           and rip at the Praetorians.
           Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES.      
           Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a      
          leather sack of sand.

          Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun
          tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The
          ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of     
          insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting.

                         AMOUN
          Come on! You can pass through!
          Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo,      
          killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks        
          back at Kosmo in horror.
          Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's      
          almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him,        
          sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword
          into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and
          Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside.
          Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over
          the corpse into the protected circle.                       
          The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the     
          barrier of insects to no avail.                             

                         AMOUN
          Only humans can penetrate the
          shield!
          Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm,    
          thinking.

                         PERSEUS
          Only humans...
          He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there,
          alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way
          toward the barrier.

                         PERSEUS
          Drop the barrier!                                          r

                         PERSEUS
          Drop it, Amoun!
          At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to
          the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS
          DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If
          you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily
          rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.

          Have you learned nothing? If you
          break out now, we're all at risk.
          On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh.         
          Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love.

          Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.              

                         PERSEUS
          Get down!
          Perseus backs away three steps. To the others               --    

                         PERSEUS
          Get ready to defend yourselves!
          Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out
          through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around
          the humans. They have only a moment to react as the
          stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.

                         DRACO
          Let's kill these freks!
          Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling
          off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia.
          Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a
          look: "You're the one that I want."
          They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges,
          thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the
          rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape.
          Perseus rolls out of the way.
          Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster       
          catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO!           
          Bloody spittle flies from his tongue.                        
          Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and
          sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a
          rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia
          and careens toward her, head bloody.
          Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back     
          with both feet, knocking him over the edge.

          Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets
          off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure
          hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES.
          He slams into the dust, dead.
          Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he       
          tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him
          as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the
          bloody puncture wounds.

          A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans
          the horizon.

                         DOWN BELOW
          Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending
          off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long.
          The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted,
          looking around nervously.
          Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions.      
          Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking       
          all but their blue eyes.                                     
          They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the
          beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing             
          SCIMITARS to cut them down.

                         PERSEUS
          Vidalia... we need to help them...
          He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of       
          the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what       

                         SHE SEES:                                                    
          The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck     
          broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace --    
          King Acrisius.

          cannot hear her --

          To save me, you risked everything
          -- your mission, your friends...
          the fate of multitudes. Men need
          better judgment in the one who is
          meant to lead them...                                       
          No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.

                         VIDALIA
          You shouldn't have risked your
          life for me. It is a waste to                               
          save me when I'll be gone so soon.
          She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.               

                         VIDALIA
          Thank you for your reckless
          disregard. Thank you, Perseus...
          Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a
          quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT    
          PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers      
          Perseus' wound.                                             
          The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus.         
          Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently      
          lays him down.                                              
          Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and          
          slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its         
          stomach.

          Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen. One
          reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but
          suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature,
          spooked, sniffs the air.
          All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel
          over, dead. The cause: Set the Void glides over,
          surveying the battlefield.

          The Expedition rides through a war-ravaged village of            
          stucco and thatch. DOORS and SHUTTERS CREAK shut as they

          The Skolothians have suffered more
          than their share in this war. The
          Legions of the Gods have battered
          them.

                         SPYROS
          It's no wonder they shy away from
          all strangers.
          Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting        
          company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is    
          staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.

          The Expedition climbs through rugged country. At a turn,
          Amoun looks up. Dead ahead, wreathed in fog -- sheer
          granite pinnacles, one towering above the others.

                         AMOUN
          They're witches in the form of
          Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a                              
          Strix. They have powerful magic                             
          and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters,
          among other things.
          (off Perseus' shock)
          But they owe me a favor. When the
          war broke out, they lent their
          power to men against the Gods in                            
          exchange for infant sacrifice.
          Tiamat struck them blind for their
          treachery. When they came for                               
          help, I fashioned them an
          artificial eye, for their Second                            
          Sight.

                         PERSEUS

          Yes. They have to take turns. If

          The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle.              
          WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The
          WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a
          GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade
          poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus.
          OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a
          strike.

                         SPYROS
          Stay away from my boy!
          Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman        
          over his head, where he lands hard with an "UMPH!"           
          Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has       
          none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another          
          charge.
          Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his           
          position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his        
          frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood;        
          eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the         

          WHISPERING.

                         PERSEUS
          Spyros, he means me no harm.                                 
          The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt.
          The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels
          before Perseus, head bowed.

                         PERSEUS
          I hear you and I understand you.
          But I don't know how.

          The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has
          a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade,
          honoring Zeus.

                         PERSEUS
          An offering'? I thank you and
          take it humbly, as agift from a
          friend, not an offering.
          He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the
          Shaikh.

          Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus...

          mysterious stranger.

          stairs and GROANING ROPE BRIDGES.

          In a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE-
          STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around:
          regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby
          bones.
          A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are                
          the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human-                    
          sized owls with the gray faces of old crones                (Strix).    
          Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one              
          ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and      
          pop it in to study the arrivals.

          You've wasted a journey. I trust
          it was not a taxing one.
          The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos
          and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the
          Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing
          irritation.

          Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and          
          snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH.             
          Perseus goes to the precipice.

          Perseus fights through cobwebs and hanging roots. The

          A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A

          Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints

          Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving
          the fleet untouched.
          But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon.
          The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE
          appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at
          impossible speed --
          TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS

          once -- a mortal creature of such
          rare beauty as to tempt even the
          Gods. One night, on the road

          the Void.

          FLASHBACK - EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

          A stunning beauty, YOUNG MEDUSA, carries a water pitcher.    
          Suddenly, frightened, she turns, sees something, drops       
          the pitcher and runs.

          regarded Medusa with disdain. The
          prayers of such a frail and filthy
          mortal angered Tiamat.

          twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads

          He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the defensive
          position, turning as she moves around him.                  

                         VIDALIA
          Listen... you will hear her
          muscles coil. Feel her hunger in                            
          your gut. Ask, how will she feed                            
          it?

                         PERSEUS
          I wish it, but I can't perceive
          the world that way.

                         VIDALIA
          You can. You're the son of a God.

          me of that.

          You do not see yourself clearly                             
          yet. In time, your actions in                               
          crisis will sharpen your view.                              
          Her faith touches him deeply. She resumes the lesson:

          You can do those things, Perseus,                           
          and much more.
          He shadows her movements more closely, back and forth.

          Surprisingly, he lands on his feet, and immediately
          sweeps her legs. She starts to fall backwards, but --
          SLOW MOTION as Perseus dives forward and cradles her
          gently as they both fall to the floor. A move beyond
          human. She looks up at his closed eyes, worried. Their
          lips are inches apart. REGULAR SPEED --

          She kisses him, deeply. He returns it. Suddenly, she        
          rolls free and stands up, turning away from him.            

                         PERSEUS
          Wait...
          She is already climbing the ladder. She stops for only a

          Spyros is at the rail, looking over the ocean of ice.       
          Perseus, troubled, arrives. Spyros looks at him closely.    

                         PERSEUS
          What?

                         SPYROS
          Nothing.

          A look I know well.

          From me?

                         SPYROS
          Never before.

                         PERSEUS
          Then where?
          Spyros smiles, puts his huge, calloused hand on Perseus'    
          shoulder.

          A landscape of volcanic rock. Lava pouring into the sea
           raises VEILS OF STEAM, through which the Expedition          
          disembarks from the galley.

          half-sunk in the dried lava flow.

          Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words and point. They all

          TWO STONE STATUES flank the entrance: a pair of enormous
          CENTAURS -- NESSUS and IXION, their eyelids sewn shut.
          Icos and Krikor exchange distressed looks.

                         AMOUN
          Medusa must have turned them to
          stone.
          Perseus swings his sickle, measuring its balance, and       
          adjusts his shield. He checks a canvas sack on his belt.

          I go with my boy.
          Perseus, Spyros, and Draco split off toward the temple.     
          Suddenly, the two "statues," Nessus and Ixion, shake off
          their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE. They GALLOP down the
          ridge, hooves shaking the ground. They raise fearsome
          spiky maces of jagged iron.
          Vidalia readies her sling. The Shaikh draws his
          scimitar. Mongke and Tamburlane load their handgonnes,
          the others draw swords.

          They tie on blindfolds and feel their way into the
          Temple.

          EXT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - LAVA FIELD - DAY

          Nessus and Ixion arrive. Ixion's mace catches Krikor,       
          flinging him to his death in an open lava vent. Icos
          CRIES OUT for his friend and charges in. Ixion smashes
          him to oblivion.
          Thad, enraged, races at Nessus, but the Centaur dodges      
          the massive Praetorian and kicks him in the chest,          
          killing him.

          Nessus charges Amoun. Amoun throws a handful of sand,
          which becomes a hail of STEEL-BARBED DARTS in midair,      C
          which lash the Centaur's flesh.
          Tamburlane rolls under the beast and fires his weapon.      
          Nessus hurls the monster-hunter against a boulder and       
          goes for him when --

          slashes but is ripped from his hands. The Shaikh BOWS       

          HIS HEAD.
          Nessus' mace shatters Shaikh Suleiman's head of charred     
          wood. BLUE FIRE shoots out his neck, ENVELOPING THE         
          CENTAUR. The burning Centaur crumples, dead.                
          Ixion SLAMS his mace down, just missing Amoun. Suddenly,    
          Vidalia's sling-bullets slice his flesh. Ixion turns and

          In the subterranean temple, we HEAR Ixion landing above;    
          dust rains into the cavern. SUNLIGHT angles through         
          holes in the roof.                                          
          Draco, Spyros and Perseus move blindly through the          
          debris. CORPSES everywhere, faces frozen in stone           
          screams.                                                    
          The men can't see it, but one wall suddenly frames a
          silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a
          woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile.
          WE SEE only GLIMPSES of Medusa as she slides through the
          shadows. Her forked tongue tastes the air.
          CUTTING BETWEEN Spyros, Perseus and Draco, moving
          silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary.
          OUR VIEW of Draco is suddenly BLOCKED by Medusa -- she      
          coils around Draco without touching him. He HEARS the       
          RASP of SCALES ON STONE.

          I hear her, Perseus. She's near!
          Her torso behind him, she RATTLES her tail in front.
          Draco spins and slices the air. The RATTLE stops. Draco
          waits, confused.

          Medusa gingerly tugs Draco's blindfold free. Draco sees               
          the tail before him. Unthinking, he instinctively spins               
          and looks.
          Medusa's face is inches from Draco's. His muscles lock                
          and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating SMOKY

          WITH THE HARPOON as its sails cleanly through slanted        
          pillars and debris, WHOOSH, WHOOSH, until it comes
          through a tiny opening and --
          THUDS into Medusa's body! The Monster SCREAMS, whipping      
          about. She tries to pull the harpoon out, but can't.

          Medusa's enraged attention shifts back and forth between
          the VOICES of the two men, deciding which to attack.
          Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every

          Medusa is coiled around the column, harpoon stuck in her     
          bloody side. She CRAWLS DOWN toward Perseus.                 
          Perseus against the column. FROM THE TOP OF FRAME,           
          Medusa's fingers reach for his blindfold. She pulls the      
          knot and the blindfold falls.                                
          Eyes closed, Perseus slashes the air, sweeping the sickle    
          about until it SMASHES into the column -- BRINNNGI The       
          SOUND ECHOES, then FADES.                                    
          Perseus waits and listens. Then, PING!, one drop of
          Medusa's blood lands on his shield.                          
          Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield. In the     
          reflection on the bronze, he SEES: Movement. Snakes.         
          Searing eyes... Medusa!
          Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him. Medusa's       
          talons DEFLECT the blade and the sickle flies from his
          grip.                                                        
          Perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees. Behind
          him, Medusa SLITHERS down the column and heads for           
          Perseus.
          Perseus reaches the sickle. He lifts his shield up in
          front of him and sees Medusa's reflection growing closer
          behind him.
          He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping. A       
          soft F-THMMP as the blade slices through something...
          SILENCE. Perseus turns away and opens his eyes, looking
          into the shield. Still, Medusa looms behind him!             
          But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the
          ground. The headless reflection topples over, dead.         r-

          THE AFTERMATH: the survivors -- Vidalia, Amoun, Mongke,
          and Tamburlane -- take mournful stock of their losses.
          Mongke sees something, smiles and SWEARS in his language.
          They all turn to see:
          Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top
          of the Temple steps. Perseus grasps the canvas sack.
          Now it holds Medusa's head, which bloodies the whole bag
          and sends a crimson drip to the stones. There is still       
          movement in there -- squirming serpents.

          The relief fleet is lost.
          Monsters gather outside our walls.
          Soon I won't be able to keep my
          own people at bay. And still, no
          word from the Expedition.
          Kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the

          vengeful... and dangerous.

          Yes, as bad as men.
          (as Perseus smiles)
          And would you have that sort guide
          your life?

                         PERSEUS
          No. Men must be accountable to
          themselves. Otherwise we serve
          poor masters.

          We must keep moving. Time is

          We all need rest. If you don't

          left when you face the Kraken.
          Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral
          than ever) is suddenly alert. She peers into the woods,
          agitated. Then she EXCLAIMS SOFTLY, dismounts and runs
          into the woods.

                         PERSEUS
          Vidalia!
          Perseus slides from his horse and follows her. Mongke

          Vidalia darts through the trees. She stops, closes her

          her.

          I know this place...
          Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree.

                         (UNCERTAIN)
          I know they were humans. They
          seemed so fragile. I sheltered
          them because I thought the harsh
          world would break them. Now I

          had done an impossible thing.
          Beautiful, yes, but not fragile.
          Resilient. Fearless.

                         PERSEUS
          I was mad with fear. I was no

          What is this?
          A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced.
          Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring.

          When the war began, Men ranged
          through the hills, stamping out
          any trace of God-worship they
          found.
          (touching the tablet)
          My true name was carved here.
          When it was obliterated, my
          worshippers lost faith and my last

          Both Amoun and Vidalia are surprised.

                         AMOUN
          If by some miracle you survive
          this encounter with Leviathan, the                          
          hand of the Princessa is your
          reward.                                                     

                         PERSEUS                                                     
          I want no reward.                                           

                         AMOUN
          Are you so selfish? Would you                               
          risk everything for the foolish
          love of --
          A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the Shrine. The       
          berries turn brown and shrivel.                             
          Amoun grabs his chest. Perseus and Vidalia crumple in       
          agony.
          SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE SHRINE. Amoun tries to          
          invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun         
          splits open.                                                
          Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen        
          wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her.       
          Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set          
          points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand. It flies     
          across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into the tablet    
          that once held Vidalia's true name.                         
          Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm. Perseus      
          doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch. Suffocating,    
          Vidalia FADES MORE.                                         
          Immobilized, Perseus watches her struggle and searches      

                         HIS BEING:                                                  

                         PERSEUS                                                     
          (low, rasping)                                              
          I am half God... and now is the                             
          time...                                                     
          Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an
          ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF
          WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back,
          aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth.
          Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The        
          God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES.

                         CONTINUED:
          Perseus slams the God down in a ghastly heap, which
          liquefies into thick black blood. It seeps into the
          sandy floor, leaving an ugly stain.                          
          Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is more evanescent
          than ever. They look with pain at the remains of Amoun.      

                         VIDALIA
          I'm so sorry, Perseus.
          A look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus'       
          face.                                                        

                         VIDALIA

                         (IN AWE)
          You faced a God in lethal
          combat... and vanquished him.
          Never have I heard of such a
          thing.
          He looks at her, mind racing, then lifts her as he           
          stands.

                         PERSEUS
          We must go quickly now.
          He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The
          light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the
          blade.

                         PERSEUS
          The combat has just begun.

          Fantasos and the LEADERS of the Revolution are gathered
          around a SACRIFICIAL FIRE. They fill the room with their

          CHANTING.

          Fantasos moves through smoke to an altar, on which is a      
          fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation we've     
          seen.

          Loyal servants...
          it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken      
          on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it         
          breathes.

          You have sown the seeds of revolt.
          Now comes the harvest. My legions
          stand ready at the gates. Only
          one rite of consecration remains
          before the Ascension.
          Fantasos, closest to the Idol, flinches, buffeted by an
          unseen draft.

          TIAMAT                                                      (V.0.)

          A GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully
          on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia.

          INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured
          face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly
          where she is.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - BACK GATE - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and
          sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her
          palm and hurries inside.
          After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open    
          gate.

          Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign of
          Andromeda.

                         PESHET
          My lady? Princess Andromeda?
          She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off,

                         ALARMED --
          Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony,
          preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound,      
          teetering.                                                   
          Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a       
          knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid.             

                         ANDROMEDA
          Peshet, stop! I know what I am                               
          meant to do.

          My lady, please --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to                              
          understand that the fate of so                               
          many could rest with me.

          Andromeda, please. Please.

          I'm not afraid anymore. I will do                            
          what I must. I will die so that                              
          they may live.

          She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to    
          safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING      
          on the marble.                                               

                         PESHET
          I won't allow it, my lady. Today,                            
          you are only a Princess. One day
          your people may need a Queen ready                           
          to die for them.
          Peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it.

          We must get to my mother and
          father.
          A VOICE from the darkness:

          AGENOR (O.S.)
          Your father is dead and your
          mother has been relieved of her                              
          suffering.                                                   
          The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor          
          wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance.

                         AGENOR
          The Princessa is coming with us.
          She has a rendezvous to keep.
          Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into
          the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet.
          Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her    
          knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda.             

                         PESHET
          Come and get her.                                            
          Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with       
          feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To       
          the Second Rebel --

          Run, Princess! Save yourself.                                
          Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel.                             
          Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily        
          closes the gap.

          He grabs her in a bear hug from behind. She spins, tiny
          within his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him. He
          JOLTS in surprise, Andromeda's knife in his belly. He
          falls on her, dead.
          Peshet wins her struggle with the Third Rebel, sinking
          her dagger in him. She GASPS. Agenor has thrust his
          blade into her ribs. She totters and COUGHS -- deep and
          bloody. Peshet falls against the wall.
          Andromeda WAILS at the sight. She is pinned beneath the      
          dead weight of the Second Rebel, unable to move. Agenor

          Vidalia is almost transparent. The Expedition reacts in      
          shock to what they see.

          FROM BEHIND THE GROUP
          They're on a shelf above the wide, flat basin that lies      
          outside Joppa. A limitless INHUMAN ARMY -- Centaurs,

          Among the regiments of Joppans waiting nervously for the     
          battle are ranks of fifteen-foot AUTOMATA (CLOCKWORK         
          SOLDIERS). OPERATORS feverishly work the mechanisms of       
          the steel soldiers, which flex their artificial limbs and
          weigh their massive weapons.

          You'll have to tell them yourself.
          Vidalia's voice has become weaker.

                         VIDALIA
          The people are frightened. But                              
          they can triumph.. They need only
          one thing.
          Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- "Tell
          me...                                                       11

          Agenor's thugs chain her to the winch at the precipice,     
          hundreds of feet above the raging sea. As the winch is      
          cranked, the chain lifts Andromeda upside down from the     
          ground.
          Agenor pulls Andromeda close and flashes a cruel grin.      
          She spits in his eye. He wipes his eyes and lets go of      
          the chain.

          A mile offshore, a BULGE OF WATER SWELLS and plows toward
          the coast.
          The Onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races

          the links above her. With effort, she climbs the very
          chain she dangles from, leaving a slack loop beneath.
          Leviathan's eyes break the surface below, watching          
          Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES UPWARDS, jaws
          wide.

          FROM ABOVE - ANDROMEDA
          Leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her. UP, UP, UP.
          The JAWS SNAP CLOSED... just below her climbing feet. So
          close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN!
          The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its    
          jaws. The Princessa plummets with it.                       

          UP ON THE PLATFORM
          The chain unreels wildly, pulls tight... and rips the       
          platform from its anchors. It careens over the edge,
          taking Fantasos, Agenor and their Thugs to their
          screaming death.
          A SHADOW glides over the shocked onlookers. One by one,

          Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand.        
          Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and    
          the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the      
          monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles.                    
          Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives    
          after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he      
          looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both
          sinking. Perseus goes after the sack.                        
          Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes
          darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her.
          Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from      
          her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her     
          entire body.
          The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor.
          The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon
          wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and
          is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the
          harpoon.
          Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked           
          toward the maw.
          Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus        
          concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots      
          through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
          LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the
          harpoon in the Kraken's tail --
          -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
          Andromeda.
          Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge       
          races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits        
          Andromeda out.                                               
          The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus.       
          Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the
          sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling
          energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening
          them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.

          The monster thrashes, tries to turn -- but unbending
          stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves --
          the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent
          hook.
          Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a           
          mountain range, picking up speed as it plunges into the

          Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the    
          downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it      

                         DROPS --                                                     
          -- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN
          FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed
          and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks
          away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above
          it, creating a giant opening to the sky.

          EXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON                                (OCEAN)                                                     - PROW - DAY     

          Tiamat's face contorts, sensing her beloved Leviathan is
          dead. She turns at the sound of GHASTLY CREAKING -- the
          immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the
          ocean. As the towering masts drop below wave-level,
          Tiamat raises her arms to the sky --

                         TIAMAT
          I damn you, Zeus! You will hear
          my curses forever in the crash of

                         SURF                                                        --
          Walls of water collapse, burying the Goddess, her ship,                      
          and her malediction deep in her realm. We HEAR a world-                      
          rocking ROAR, which booms off toward --                                      

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

          Tiamat's Monster Army is DEAFENED by the BOOM, losing all    
          spirit with the unmistakable certainty that their Goddess    
          is gone.                                                     
          THE TIDE TURNS IN THE BATTLE as the Joppans and their        
          steel allies, the Automata, wade into the ranks of           
          creatures.                                                   
          Mongke and Tamburlane, in the center of the battle, find
          the opposition turning tail. They roar and lift their
          weapons high, surviving yet another fight. Spyros,
          bloodied but unbowed, smiles wide and sits down in the
          mud, exhausted.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
          Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...
          CHOOM! Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms,          

          GASPING FOR AIR.

          EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

          The onlookers rejoice.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          BACK WITH Perseus and Andromeda. He looks at her             
          lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as      
          he did with Anteros the fisherman??                          
          Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a      
          short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
          arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!               
          Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
          too, breathes again, relieved.
          For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
          find themselves alone, holding each other.

                         PERSEUS
          Hello.
          (as she smiles,

                         RELIEVED)
          Are you all right?
          She takes a moment, doing an inventory. Finally, she
          nods.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I am.
          He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to          
          oblivion.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Are you ready to become a king?
          His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She          
          accepts that, rueful.

                          

                         PERSEUS
          Are you ready to become a queen?

                         CONTINUED:
          She thinks about it, her face beginning to light with
          confidence.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Yes. Yes, I am.

                         PERSEUS
          Then you're ready to go home.
          Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD      
          BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
          Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully          
          alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
          then climbs on behind her.
          Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost    
          from sight.

          EXT. BLUE SKY AND WHITE CLOUDS - DAY

          Black smoke RISES to dirty the perfect sky. TILT DOWN

                         TO:

          EXT. SACRED GROUND - DAY

          The Sacred Ground of Joppa in the verdant hills, above      
          the sea, is so beautiful it might be mistaken for           
          Olympos.
          TWO FUNERAL PYRES burn. The citizens of Joppa, by the       
          thousands, commend King Kepheus and Queen Cassiopeia to     
          the afterlife.                                              
          MOVING OVER THE CROWD, WE PUSH THROUGH the flame to find    
          the new ruler of Joppa. Mournful, but cloaked in regal      
          dignity and strength -- QUEEN ANDROMEDA.                    

                         CUT TO:

          A DISTANT POV OF THE QUEEN
          The ceremony and the heavenly setting.

                         PERSEUS
          Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him,
          Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --

                         CONTINUED:
          -- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP. Just as
          quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus          
          looks in that direction, to find --
          ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
          He couldn't look more imposing.

                         ZEUS
          Am I to understand you do not
          intend to make this union with the
          Queen Andromeda?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Despite my will and intention that
          you do so?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Would you choose to condemn Men,
          your own people, to suffer more of
          this devastating War?

                         PERSEUS
          I have no people. You have
          stranded me between realms,
          neither man nor God.

                         ZEUS

                         (STERNLY)
          Do you reproach Zeus?

                         PERSEUS
          No. I thank you... Father.
          Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
          softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.

                         PERSEUS
          You have freed me. I will not be
          a pawn for Men or Gods.

                         ZEUS
          Does that absolve you suddenly of
          your responsibilities?

                         PERSEUS
          You've made me understand that my
          responsibility is to myself. So
          it is with us all.

                         (INTIMATELY)
          You've put me to a great test. In
          the midst of it, I found the
          courage in my heart to defy Gods.
          I do not know how much of that
          comes from you, Father... and how
          much from my Mother, who I never
          knew.
          Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.

                         PERSEUS
          It matters not. Whatever the
          source, I are only grateful.
          He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
          throng.

                         PERSEUS
          This war will end the moment you
          choose for it to end... and Men
          agree. I think, perhaps, that is
          the free will that all realms
          share.
          Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an
          offspring, what a creation!

                         ZEUS
          What will you do, Man of free
          will?
          Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his
          back.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm going to find Vidalia.

                         ZEUS
          So... my Son, you will be a pawn
          for love?

                         PERSEUS

                         (LAUGHS)
          Yes, Father, gladly.
          Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into the sky. And
          soars away.

          FADE OUT.

          OVER BLACK:
                         
          In the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT,
          resounding like a drum.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O)
           In between the years when the
           oceans drank Atlantis and the rise
           of the Sons of Aryas, there was an
           age undreamed of, when shining
           kingdoms lay spread across the
           world like blue mantles under the
           stars. Hither came Conan, the
           Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a
           king born of battle.
                         
          Muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the
          guttural CRIES of combat.
                         
                         UNBORN BABY
                         
          Eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb.
                         
          Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its
          tip not an inch from the baby's head.
                         
          As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we
          travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FIELD - DAY
                         
          A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
          sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian
          beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody
          stomach.
                         
          Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling
          snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built
          CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene.
                         
                          CORIN
           Islene!!!
                         
          Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin
          cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never
          leaving Islene.
                         
          The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
          earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.
                         
                          AESIR
           Now, now little whore. Did I get
           you or your little one?
           2.
                         
                         
          Islene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
          fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the
          sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
          Aesir's armor -- at his groin.
                         
                          ISLENE
           I'd ask you the same.
                         
          The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the
          killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The
          Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.
                         
          Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees
          beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands
          back they are coated in blood.
                         
          Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a
          knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.
                         
                          ISLENE (CONT'D)
           Take your child.
                         
                          CORIN
           I cannot.
                         
          Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses
          against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.
                         
                          ISLENE
           There is no time, husband. I would
           see my child's face.
                         
          Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the
          knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife
          to use. Never once does she scream.
                         
          A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up
          through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap.
                         
                          ISLENE (CONT'D)
           A boy. He will be strong. A warrior

          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,
          a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.
                         
          Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young
          CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the
          air, giving it an ethereal haze.
                         
          At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior
          speaks.
                         
                          URAN
           A Cimmerian warrior is like any
           other man. A Cimmerian warrior
           feels hunger. He feels cold. Like
           other men he may lie and cheat.
           (stares the boys down)
           But when a Cimmerian warrior
           hungers, he hungers only for the
           blood of his enemy. When he feels
           cold, it is the cold steel of his
           sword. When he lies, he lies in
           wait for his enemy. And when he
           cheats, he cheats death itself!
                         
          Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good
          two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,
          but his face is as stoic, driven.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)
           Conan! You are too young to be
           here. Withdraw.
                         
          CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN
          menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.
                         
                          LARGEST TEEN
           He said leave, motherless whelp.
           4.
                         
                         
          The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm
          towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the
          teen in the throat.
                         
          The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for
          air.
                         
          A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced
          by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,
          ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the
          large stones in their mouths.
                         
                          URAN
           In the black crag in the high pass
           stands a wooden training sword. The
           one who claims it, with stone still
           in his mouth, will have earned the
           right to train with the warriors.
                         
          The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)
           Well? What are you waiting for?!
                         
          And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the
          other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel
          their stones. One or two succeed.
                         
          Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
          into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff
          face.
                         
          Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.
                         
                         CLIFF FACE
                         
          And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.
          They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock
          face as though it were a ladder.
                         
          The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,
          trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds
          another path. In moments he is ahead.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger
          boys right behind him.
                         
          They race through the forest, heading uphill --
                         
          When Conan spots movement ahead. He pauses --
           5.
                         
                         
          And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
          boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an
          AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.
                         
          All the boys stop. Out of the dense forest come
                         
          FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES
                         
          Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand
          axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their
          waist.
                         
          The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They
          turn and run in the opposite direction.
                         
          Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.
                         
                          CIMMERIAN BOY
           Conan! Run!
                         
          But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. He
          turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.
                         
          The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN.

                         LATER
                         
          Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS.
          They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT, escaping in the
          other direction. One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit.
          Corin desperately searches for his son.
                         
                          CORIN
           Conan? Conan?!
                         
          Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered
          in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked
          to pieces.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           What have you done, boy?
                         
          Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his
          father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth.
                         
                          CONAN
           They killed one. I killed three. I
           am a warrior now.
                         
          Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.
          Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts, they are
          aghast. Conan looks confused. Why aren't they happy?
           6.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           A warrior? What you have done a
           jackal would do. Never a warrior.
                         
                          CONAN
           They would have done the same --
                         
                          CORIN
           As I said, jackals.
                          (TO URAN)
           He is not ready. I will forge him
           myself.

          Conan is tested under Corin's watchful eye:
                         
          - Forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm
          inside.
                         
          - A heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on
          wet river rocks.
                         
          - Climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind
          on the jagged rocks.
                         
                         
          INT. CIMMERIAN FORGE - DAY
                         
          Flames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the
          bellows of the forge. Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he
          stokes the blaze.
                         
          Corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. Conan cannot take his
          eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows.
                         
                          CORIN
           Stoke your fire, boy.
                         
          Conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.
                         
                          CONAN
           "Stoke your fire, chop your wood."
           I have slept where wolves dare not.
           I have balanced a thousand river
           stones. When will you teach me the
           sword?
                         
          Corin stares his son in the eyes. Judging.
           7.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           Think you're ready? Then tell me:
           what is a sword's purpose?
                         
                          CONAN
           To slay ones enemies.
                         
                          CORIN
           No. That is what it does. Its
           purpose is why you use it.
                         
          He tosses Conan two lumps of ore.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           Tell me, which makes the best
           sword?
                         
          Conan takes the two lumps, testing them. He hands his father
          back one.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall
           make a sword of it, and tomorrow
           you will show me what brute
           strength yields.

          With a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin.
          Conan attacks with fury. Corin defends with grace. Until the
          boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that
          SHATTERS CONAN'S SWORD.
                         
          Corin simply turns and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle
          what happened.
                         
          Corin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving Conan to
          puzzle what happened.
                         
                         
          INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan works the bellows, putting his back into it. Corin
          places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt.
                         
                          CONAN
           Why did it break?
           8.
                         
                         
                          CORIN
           Because it had no life.

          Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword
          with hammer. Corin nods at Conan, who sprinkles the glowing
          blade with ash.
                         
           CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           The strongest blade isn't made of
           the hardest steel, boy. The hardest
           ore is what a man will die for. It
           is strong and unyielding. It
           neither cowers nor concedes. But
           without the softer ore, it can be
           shattered like glass.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack
          tub, only to place it right back into the flames.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           The softer ore is what a man lives
           for. It is flexible and lasting. It
           survives, even against the greatest
           of foes. But too much of the soft
           ore, the blade will not cut deep
           enough when it must.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Corin fashions the blade's hilt, engraving the guard and
          pommel. It is a work of art.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           A sword must be tempered, the two
           ores united through fire and ice.
           Through its suffering the sword
           comes to hold both life and death.
                         
          Corin hands Conan the sword.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           Now tell me, what is this sword's
           purpose?
                         
          Conan furrows his brow, trying to puzzle the answer. He
          can't. Corin's disappointment shows. He takes the sword from
          Conan's hands.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           This one is not ready yet.
           9.
                         
                         
          Blood rushes to Conan's face but he says nothing. He rushes
          out.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
                         
          Frustrated, Conan slashes through a field of reeds, cutting
          everything within reach of him, expending his rage.
                         
          Behind him something moves in the forest. We catch just a
          glimpse of the PICT, the same one that escaped Conan in the
          earlier scene.
                         
          Conan's instincts cause him to spin around -- but then
          there's nothing there.
                         
                         
          INT. CIMMERIAN SCOUT POST - DAY
                         
          Built into the side of a huge tree, fifty feet up, this
          wooden structure houses two CIMMERIAN SENTRIES. A BIRD CRIES
          in the woods, causing one of the sentries to investigate.
                         
          THWICK! He suddenly stands up straight, unmoving. The one
          still sitting in the structure notices.
                         
                          CIMMERIAN SENTRY
           See something?
                         
          The standing sentry falls backwards, revealing an ARROW
          piercing his right eye. Shocked, the remaining sentry reaches
          for the WARNING HORN mounted on the wall.
                         
          But as he reaches for it, his shadow becomes three
          dimensional, MORPHING into
                         
          A SHADOW SCOUT
                         
          A thin, feral humanoid, bodies covered in tattoos, from the
          deepest jungles of Zingara. The scout lashes out with his
          black sword and cuts straight across the sentry's throat.
                         
          This Shadow Scout's name is REMO.
                         
                         
          EXT. SCOUT POST - DAY
                         
          Remo exits and stares down at CHEREN, a BLIND ARCHER clad in
          lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat. Cheren has an arrow
          notched and ready, but somehow he knows not to fire.
                         
          Cheren lowers his bow and lets out a BIRD WHISTLE --
           10.
                         
                         
          And the forest comes alive. The forces are an odd
          combination; massive KUSHITE TRIBESMEN, dark-skinned savages
          from the savannahs of Kush, and a LEGION OF AQUILONIAN
          MERCENARIES, heavily armored knights drawn from the cities of
          Aquilonia.
                         
          Their leaders, respectively, are the six foot-five Kushite
          chief UKAFA, gold-toothed, his body painted for battle, and
          the handsome, silver-armored Aquilonian LUCIUS.
                         
                          UKAFA
           That's the last of their guard
           towers.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           All this sneaking around for a
           lowly tribe of barbarians.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
           This lowly tribe of barbarians have
           buried every warrior ever to set
           foot on this land, Lucius.
                         
          KHALAR SINGH, a warlord atop a black horse, rides through the
          fog-shrouded trees.
                         
          He bears a nomadic visage, with tanned skin and almond-shaped
          eyes. While his voice is calm, his eyes burn with malice.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           That is only because they have
           never faced my legion.
                         
          Khalar regards Lucius with amusement.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Then show us. But should you fail,
           remember the plan.
                         
          Lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to Khalar Singh.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Corin walks out of the forge, looking around for Conan.
          Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine, but
          Conan is nowhere to be seen.
                         
                          CORIN
           Conan?
           11.
                         
                         
          Corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick
          fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out
          there.
                         
          Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors
          burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength.
                         
          But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds
          they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious
          charge of their own.
                         
          SLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash
          into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones --
                         
          Where the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead
          the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing
          their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over
          the Aquilonian's shorter weapons.
                         
          And quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin
          squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating.
          Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Retreat!
                         
          As a unit, the Aquilonians race back into the woods. In
          seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit.
                         
                          CORIN
           Wait! Hold your ground!
                         
          But it's too late, nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are
          gone on the chase.
                         
                         
          EXT. CLIFF FACE - DAY
                         
          Lucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face.
          Nowhere left to run. They turn to see the Cimmerians
          gathering in front of them.
                         
                          URAN
           Death is in the air, invaders. Can
           you taste it?
                         
                          LUCIUS
                          (SMILES)
           Indeed. I savor it.
                         
          Uran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop
          the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers,
          bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS.
           12.
                         
                         
          They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading
          right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit
          the tree trunks beside them.
                         
          And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they
          notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows.
          The flames lick at the substance --
                         
          KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian
          warriors are burned alive.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
                         
          Conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees
          flames rising above the treetops beyond.
                         
          He races back home.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Corin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly,
          Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed
          with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining
          Cimmerians, savage against savage.
                         
          But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians
          comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing
          loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN
          HORSEMEN into the village.
                         
          The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack
          with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands
          and dragging them to the ground.
                         
          The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his
          men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and
          reaches the far end of the village.
                         
          Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians
          still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are
          helping the Spearmen slay the wounded.
                         
          Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest
          Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and
          rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the
                         CHARGE --
           13.
                         
                         
          When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's
          blade.
                         
                          CONAN
           Father!
                         
                          CORIN
           Come.
                         
          Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant
          Conan from the battle, back toward the forge.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - DAY
                         
          The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into
          the room. He bolts the door behind him.
                         
                          CONAN
           Do we need more weapons?
                         
          Corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating
          in the dirt floor. Beneath it a trough of cooling water leads
          under the hut and away from the village.
                         
                          CORIN
           Go. There is a hunting lodge in the
           North Pass with provisions.
                         
                          CONAN
           No! I will fight!
                         
          Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face.
          Corin's eyes are half-crazed.
                         
                          CORIN
           This fight is over, but yours has
           just begun. You wanted to be a
           warrior of the tribe, Conan--now
           you must be its last.
                         
                          CONAN
           Father, I am not afraid to die.
                         
                          CORIN
           Good. Make your death have purpose.
                         
          BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again,
          BOOM.
                         
          A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and
          MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away
          the bolt.
           14.
                         
                         
          In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their
          attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at
          Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and --
                         
          THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising
          up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a
          crisp.
                         
          Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from
          the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his
          back.
                         
          Corin falls to his knees.
                         
                          CONAN
           No!
                         
          Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying
          backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support
          beams.
                         
          Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan,
          pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from
          his fallen father.
                         
          Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword
          to deliver the killing blow.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
           I said I wanted a word with him.
                         
          Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge.
          Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier,
          grinning from ear to ear.
                         
          Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           As promised.
                         
                          PICT
           (strange dialect -
                          SUBTITLED)
           Their heads. You promised me their
           heads.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           All you wish, once we are gone.
                         
          The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh
          stares down at Corin, sizing him up.
                         
          Corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge.
           15.
                         
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           I take no pleasure in this day,
           barbarian. Your people are fierce
           warriors, deserving of every story
           told of them. But now you must
           choose the story for yourself. I am
           Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked
           from the best Hyboria. My second,
           Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo
           and his Shadow Scouts from the
           jungles of Zingara. And countless
           others. They all had a day like
           this one. They all chose a way
           forward.
                         
          Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun. The lieutenants stand
          behind Corin, eyeing Corin with malice.
                         
          Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at
          him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to
          give his son away.
                         
                          CORIN
           What is it you want?
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I seek neither gold nor steel, but
           flesh and blood. The last of a
           royal line that goes back three
           thousand years.
                         
          Corin LAUGHS.
                         
                          CORIN
           Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each
           man is free here.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           But I seek a woman.
                         
          Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians
          women are being herded by the slavers.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           A queen in hiding. Point her out
           and you'll spare the lives of your
           own. Perhaps even your wife?
                         
                          CORIN
           My wife was killed, long ago, by
           swine such as you.
                         
          Khalar nods, understanding.
           16.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Then our stories began in the same
           place, Cimmerian. I too lost my
           wife to marauders. How many men, in
           how many lands have suffered so?
           The only answer is power, strength
           unfettered, the kind of which can
           unite all Hyboria under a single
           crown. That is the legacy I seek.
           Will you join me?
                         
          It's a powerful, convincing speech. But Corin holds his
          tongue, unmoved.
                         
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Very well. Then death will be your
           story. Your men will die. And your
           women too, when I am done with
           them. None will survive to carry
           your name forth, and over time,
           even your enemies will forget you
           ever were. You will be wiped from
           the pages of history.
           (to his men)
           Take your blood, but leave the
           kill.
                         
          One by one, the lieutenants beat and stab Corin, taking
          pleasure in his pain.
                         
          Conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything
          other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back,
          pinning him to the ground.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Fariq! Come!
                         
          Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to
          Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the
          dispassion of a sociopath.
                         
          Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged
          together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands
          it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for
          his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching
          him multiplication.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Before you lies our enemy. His
           tribe waits for him in the beyond.
           What would you do?
           17.
                         
                         
                          FARIQ
           I would cut out his eyes, father,
           so that he will not find them. So
           he will wander the afterlife
           forever.
                         
          Khalar smiles.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Show me your strength, Fariq.
           Without it, you will never rule.
           With it, you will never be
           forgotten.
                         
          Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE. Corin doesn't make a
          sound. Once Fariq has ripped out Corin's eyes, Khalar runs
          Corin through.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           You have your desire. Death has
           found you.
                         
          Corin spits out his last words, also meant for Conan.
                         
                          CORIN
           Soon -- it comes for you.
                         
                         CONAN'S POV
                         
          Conan glimpses around the faces of Khalar and his men, each
          image seared into his memory as if ablaze.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Burn this place. It no longer
           exists.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          The forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches, thrown onto
          its roof and inside its windows. Khalar and the other watch
          as the building roars into flame.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - DAY
                         
          Smoke fills the air. Conan struggles, still unable to move.
          He COUGHS, dying.
                         
          But then the fire collapses more of the forge, and the
          falling beams shatter the one that pins Conan to the ground.
           18.
                         
                         
          Slowly, painfully, Conan drags himself into the cooling
          trough that runs beneath the hut.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Conan exits the forge only to see the entire village burning.
          The bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the
          landscape. Nothing stirs. Until he hears a strange CHOPPING
          SOUND.
                         
                         THE PICT
                         
          Conan spots the Pict, who is decapitating a dead Cimmerian
          warrior, adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed
          waist.
                         
          The Pict doesn't notice as Conan slips up behind him, then
          RUNS HIM THROUGH.
                         
          As the wide-eyed Pict dies, Conan takes the sword and CUTS A
          NOTCH into his arm.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
                         NOTCHED ARM
                         
          Where there was once a single notch, there are now FIVE such
          notches, on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another
          powerful looking arm.
                         
                         
          INT. BAR - MESSANTIA - NIGHT
                         
          A raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront. Out the window we
          see a port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush.
                         
          The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of
          those ships, and those who desire to part them from their
          hard-earned money; Zamoran thieves, Hyborean mercenaries and
          Brythunian whores. Most of them watch the arm wrestling match
          taking place at the back of the bar.
                         
          A pair of CITY GUARDS, short swords sheathed at their sides,
          enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the
          harried BARKEEP.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           He's back there.
                         
          The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers.
           19.
                         
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           What's this one done?
                         
                          BARKEEP
           What's he done?! What hasn't he
           done? He's bedded six of my whores
           and finished off three casks of
           mead--and he hasn't paid so much as
           a silver piece for it.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           So have your men deal with him.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           I did.
                         
          Behind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN
          YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped
          back into place.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Sounds like a real problem. Too bad
           we have other places to be right
           now.
                         
          The Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. He slips a
          pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           Just get that behemoth out of here.
                         
          The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar.
          His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to
          pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready
          to strike at the loser. A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch,
          caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back.
                         
          The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's
          hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey.
                         
          As the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard
          of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.
                         
                          DRUNKEN MAN
           Piss-water! You'll serve my friends
           and I your best, barman, or you'll
           taste steel!
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
           Time to leave, northerner.
                         
          The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his
          shoulder.
           20.
                         
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully
          built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with
          battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut
          black mane remain from the boy we last saw.
                         
          Conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller
          City Guards, who instinctively take a step back.
                         
                          CONAN
           No, my small friends. It's time to
           die. Now--
                         
          Conan sways. The room spins. He falls on his face.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Who's first --

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Conan, unconscious, is dragged down the street by the two
          City Guards.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1
                          (STRUGGLING)
           By the gods, he's as heavy as a
           horse.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Even a dead horse smells better
           than this.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT
                         
          The City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard. Many of
          the INMATES are shackled together, hacking with picks at the
          rock walls on their work detail. Those in no condition to
          break rock are left in their own filth to rot. Some are even
          dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains.
                         
                         
          INT. PRISON GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse, where a
          LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner.
                         
          The Lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal.
           21.
                         
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           What's the charge?
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Public drunkenness. Another damn
           hill ape who can't handle his
           liquor.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           Is that so, boy? How do you plead?
                         
          Conan yawns in response. One of the City Guards slaps Conan,
          hard, across the face. Conan slowly opens his eyes.
                         
                          CONAN
           Where's the Captain of the Guard?
                         
          SCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall, past a locked door.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           In the cells, interrogating a
           prisoner. And you'll get the same
           if you don't answer. You're accused
           of public drunkenness. How do you
           plead?
                         
                          CONAN
           In truth, I've been guilty of much.
           Jewels stolen from the crowns of
           kings, men's heads split in battle
           for the price of a night's drink.
           But through that I've searched and
           waited and hunted my prey.
                         
          Suddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did
          a moment ago.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           But drink? Haven't had a drop all
           night.
                         
          The guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those
          arms wrapped around their heads. Twist, twist. SNAP. SNAP. He
          breaks both their necks in an instant.
                         
          The Lieutenant is horrified. He goes for his sword. Conan
          bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back
          wall.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           The key to the cells.
           22.
                         
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           I don't have it. There's a guard
           inside the door. Only he can open
           it.
                         
          Conan picks up the Lieutenant's sword.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
           You can't kill me! He'll only open
           the door for me!
                         
          A FLASH OF STEEL as Conan delivers a blow.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CELLS - NIGHT
                         
          A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. Behind
          him, the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED
          PRISONER to a pulpy mess.
                         
          There's a KNOCK at the door.
                         
                          GUARD #1
           What is it?
                         
           MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
           Need to see the Captain.
                         
          The Guard exhales, frustrated. He stands up, getting his keys
          out. He stops. Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other
          room.
                         
          The Lieutenant stares back at him.
                         
                          GUARD #1
           Fine, fine.
                         
          He opens the door--
                         
          Only to see Conan standing there, holding the decapitated
          head of the Lieutenant.
                         
          The shocked Guard goes for his sword. Conan swings the
          Lieutenant's head, smashing it into the Guard's jaw and
          putting him down for the count.
                         
          That's when the Captain of the Guard turns around. And WE
          RECOGNIZE HIM! He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who
          was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Men!
           23.
                         
                         
          From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their
          weapons. Lucius draws his as well.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You've made a huge mistake, ape.
           You'll never make it out of this
           place.
                         
                          CONAN
           I came for you, Lucius.
                         
          Lucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           You talk as though you know me,
           ape.
                         
                          CONAN
           I do. And I am no ape. I am
           Cimmerian.
                         
          As recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into
          action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and
          other torture implements flying right into the first guard.
                         
          The second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan
          just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the
          iron bands of the prisoner cells.
                         
          Lucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his
          sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own
          sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH
          LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW.
                         
          Lucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot.
                         
          The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal
          with three weapons attacks at once.
                         
          The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around
          Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip.
          Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying
          into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling.
                         
          The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a
          deep gash and causing him to drop his sword.
                         
          Conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's
          face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and
          the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears.
           24.
                         
                         
          However, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react.
          The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift
          Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by
          the neck.
                         
          Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his
          throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck
          gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden
          knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning
          guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls
          the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out
          of Lucius' now liberated foot.
                         
          Conan takes Lucius' face and smashes it against the table.
          Lucius looks, aghast, as Conan takes his injured hand and
          places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. The
          Cimmerian never even bats an eye.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           What do you want? Who are you?
                         
          Conan turns his face to the burnt side.
                         
                          CONAN
           I'm the one who made you pretty.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Impossible! You're dead!
                         
          Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm.
                         
                          CONAN
           No. I am death. And I came a long
           way for you.
                         
          Conan lifts the sword.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Wait!! Wait!!
                          (CONAN PAUSES)
           I can tell you where the rest are.
                         
                          CONAN
           Where?
                         
                          LUCIUS
           The end of the earth. You kill me,
           and you'll never find them.
           25.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Who are you offering?
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Who do you think? All of them.
           Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and
           Khalar Singh himself. But you have
           to swear you won't kill me.
                         
          Conan thinks about it.
                         
                          CONAN
           You have my word. You tell me where
           I will find Khalar Singh, and I
           will not kill you.
                         
          Conan lets Lucius go. Lucius hobbles to his chair.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           He is in a city called on the edge
           of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of
           Hyboria. Khor Khalba.
                         
          Conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. He likes what he
          sees. In a flash, Conan grabs Lucius' head again, yanking it
          back, exposing his throat.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You gave your word!
                         
          Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring. He drops it in
          Lucius' throat. The big man chokes instantly. A second later,
          Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well.
                         
          Lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as Conan releases
          him.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?!
                         
                          CONAN
           Toasting, to our deal.
                         
          Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from
          the wall.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Go. You are free.
                         
          One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by
          shackles.
                         
                          ONE-EYED PRISONER
           I won't get far like this.
           26.
                         
                         
          Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmen's sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           The key to your shackles sits in
           the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.
                         
          The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice. As he closes in on
          the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Barbarian! I had your word! You
           said you would spare my life!
                         
                          CONAN
           No. I said I wouldn't kill you.
                         
          We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into the
          night, cutting another notch into his arm.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. DESERT SANDSTORM - DAY
                         
          KHALAR SINGH looks older. Worn. He squints as he stares into
          a howling sandstorm.
                         
          UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him. The
          sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less
          than five feet away.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Khalar Singh, we've lost half our
           cavalry legion, and still Fariq
           presses on! We must turn back!
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He says the Queen is here.
                         
                          UKAFA
           He leads us in circles. He knows
           nothing of leading an army --
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Take care, Ukafa. You hold a
           special place in my kingdom, but
           blood you are not.
                         
                          UKAFA
           My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am
           simply concerned for your army.
           27.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           And I would gladly sacrifice every
           last man to get my hands on the
           Queen. And in that respect, Fariq
           has my confidence. He knows more of
           the legends of Acheron than anyone.
                         
          Suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO
          and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his
          twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is.
          His frame is slight, his eyes beady.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Father, they are here! The hidden
           oasis, just as it was written.
                         
          Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen
          and shadowy Remo nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE TUNNEL - DAY
                         
          Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel
          carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages.
                         
          And on the other side of the tunnel --
                         
                         
          EXT. OASIS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the
          encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of
          grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek-
          influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick
          houses.
                         
          And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about
          their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes
          and turbans.
                         
          The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of
          the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around,
          sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling
          around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
          hurricane, protected by an unseen force.
                         
          A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the
          reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and
          softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped
          in thorns.
                         
          One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl
          next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in
          pain, angry her prayer was interrupted.
           28.
                         
                         
          Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.
          Tamara the studious good girl.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop it! I'm trying to pray!
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm bored.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then hit yourself.
                         
          Tamara hits Ilira back with her thorn. Ilira SQUEALS, then
          hits a grinning Tamara back. Tamara grabs her, but as they
                         TUSSLE--
                         
           FASSIR (O.S.)
           Is that how one shows penitence?
                         
          Both girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them.
          Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. He
          shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment.
                         
                          FASSIR (CONT'D)
           I expect more from a queen.
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of
           saying the same prayer every day.
                         
                          FASSIR
           Then you should be able to
           translate it from its original
           Acheronian.
                         
          Ilira's face scrunches, unsure. Tamara steps in to help Ilira
          save face.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Of course she can. She even taught
           it to me. "Never again."
                         
                          FASSIR
           Go on.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Never again will we stand by as
           darkness consumes the world. Never
           again will innocents suffer for
           others' power. Never again will the
           Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
           29.
                         
                         
                          FASSIR
           Very good, Tamara. You must have
           taught her very well indeed, Ilira.
                         
          A smile on Fassir's face confirms he knows the truth.
                         
          Suddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT. A moment later, a
          temple EXPLODES in flames.
                         
          Pouring out from the swirling sands come Khalar Singh's army.
          Cheren and his archers stand atop Khalar's
                         
          MAN OF WAR
                         
          A massive siege engine atop which CHEREN and his archers fire
          FLAMING ARROWS. The arrows arc down and explode as they
          impact the tiled roofs.
                         
          Sitting at the highest point of the Man Of War, Khalar Singh
          likes what he sees.
                         
                         CHAOS
                         
          The monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn,
          more troops burst out of the swirling sand.
                         
          A small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial arts
          prowess as they battle with Khalar's heavily armed forces,
          but they are vastly outnumbered.
                         
          Fassir grabs Tamara.
                         
                          FASSIR (CONT'D)
           The Queen must not be captured.
           Take her out the North Gate.
           Quickly!
                         
          Tamara grabs Ilira and pulls her through the flaming
          battleground. Zingaran warriors cut down the monks while
          Turanian horsemen concentrate on the women.
                         
                          ILIRA
           We can't leave them.
                         
                          TAMARA
           If you are caught, everything we
           live for is lost!
                         
          WHIP! A whip encircles Ilira's waist. A massive TURANIAN
          pulls her to him. Tamara grabs the whip, pulling Ilira the
          other way. But she is no match for the huge slaver. He yanks
          on the whip pulling both of them to him --
           30.
                         
                         
          Only then does he notice Tamara's unsheathed knife which she
          plunges into his throat.
                         
          She frees Ilira and they run.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A thin alleyway at the rear of the monastery, leading away
          from the din of battle, towards a rear gate of the oasis.
                         
          Tamara and Ilira run for the gate, only for the shadows of
          the alleyway to move and shift -- REMO and three of his
          shadow scouts.
                         
          They advance on the women, drawing dark shortswords.
                         
                          REMO
           No swords. Khalar needs them alive.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Good to know.
                         
          Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife,
          but when she strikes, she hits nothing but shadow. It reforms
          behind her and grabs her.
                         
          Another grabs Ilira. Tamara launches her body into the air,
          executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout. A
          quick knife strike and he goes down.
                         
          And with one continuous motion, she vaults over the shadow
          scout holding Tamara, cutting his throat as well.
                         
          Remo and the remaining scout give chase, blending in and out
          of shadows. But each time they strike, Tamara defends Ilira.
          They near the far end of the alleyway, the North gate looming
          ahead with the desert beyond.
                         
          Remo blends into another shadow --
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Remo materializes out of a shadow atop the Man Of War, next
          to Cheren, the archer.
                         
                          REMO
           The north gate. Destroy it.
                         
          Cheren and the other archers turn their fire to the gate at
          the end of the passage. They fire a volley of fiery arrows.
           31.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH GATE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara and Ilira run for the whirling sands just ahead --
          when the flaming arrows land before them.
                         
          Ilira hesitates.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Run!
                         
                          ILIRA
           We'll die!
                         
                          TAMARA
           We'll die if we stay!
                         
          She locks eyes with Ilira, who nods. Together they run right
          for the arrows.
                         
          But at the last minute, Ilira falters. She falls to the
          ground.
                         
          Tamara turns to see Ilira lying in the gateway a moment too
          late.
                         
          THE ARROWS EXPLODE causing a cave in that closes the gateway.
                         
                         
          EXT. SANDSTORM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara falls to the sand as the gate collapses behind her.
          She looks back, only to see that Ilira didn't make it.
                         
                          TAMARA
           NO!!!
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Khalar Singh stares at the cloud of destruction at the north
          tunnel.
                         
          There, one form hurries into the swirling sandstorm.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Who was guarding that gate?
                         
                          REMO
           It was I, Lord.
           32.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Take four legions. Hunt her. Before
           I hunt you.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
          Tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland, the
          plumes of the oasis' sandstorm now off in the distance behind
          her.
                         
          The sun mercilessly beats down upon her face, her lips are
          already chapped. She falls to her knees, unable to go on.
                         
          She looks up, as the heat streams off the desert floor,
          creating a swirling mirage. Through which the silhouette of a
          rider appears, followed by others.
                         
                         SLAVER CARAVAN
                         
          The horse-drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron
          bars, and behind the bars are a bevy of young women, mostly
          looking worse for wear.
                         
          The HEAD SLAVER rides ahead, and walks up to the heap of
          white cloth that is Tamara.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Water -- please --
                         
          He lifts her barely conscious head, eyeing her features, a
          greasy paw examining her body. He smiles.
                         
                          HEAD SLAVER
           The gods are good.
           (to the other slavers)
           Chain this one in my cage. She'll
           be the prize of the auction in Khor
           Kalba.

          EXT. OASIS - NIGHT
                         
          The Man of War dominates the center of the oasis, its torches
          illuminating the scene before it. Akhun and the Turanians
          hold chains connected to the twenty women monks, kneeling,
          with their wrists chained to their neck collars.
                         
          In front of them kneels Fassir, beaten and bloodied.
           33.
                         
                         
          Khalar Singh, Fariq, and Ukafa step down from the Man of War.
          Fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings
          on it.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           All these years searching the ends
           of the earth. And here you are.
           Just a two day ride from Khor
           Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.
                         
                          FASSIR
           (in Acheronian, to monks)
           Say nothing.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't
           know who we are. Maybe he's not
           looking for the Queen.
                         
          Several of the women look up at him, shocked.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           That's right, my brethren, you have
           been lied to all your lives. Told
           you must hide yourselves, told you
           were alone. I want you to look at
           me, and see me for what I am. A
           brother. A friend. I have come not
           to hurt you, but liberate you.
                         
                          FASSIR
           You come for your own dark
           purposes, to raise Acheron.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Yes. I come to resurrect the
           greatest empire Hyboria has ever
           known.
                         
                          FASSIR
           An empire of evil, soaked in blood
           sacrifice and the blackest of
           magic.
                         
          Khalar Singh becomes infuriated, eyes blazing.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Have you hidden from the world so
           long that you cannot to see? Blood,
           magic, death: it is everywhere.
           Acheron is no different than any
           other kingdom, but for its glory.

           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           And in place of that glory, you
           offer shame? I knew shame, but that
           was before I was shown my true
           lineage.
                         
          Khalar draws closer to the women, looking them each in the
          eye.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           When I was but a child, raiders
           destroyed my village, cut our
           fathers to ribbons, and burned our
           women as sacrifice to foreign gods.
           Those few who survived, we ran for
           our lives, chased into caves at the
           edge of the Eastern Sea, left with
           nothing to live for. But then we
           discovered it. Acheron. The temple
           that spawned an empire. We learned
           that we were not broken goat-
           herders on a desolate coastline. We
           were the sons and daughters of
           kings.
           (stares in Ilira's eyes)
           And queens.
                         
          He motions to Fariq, who brings the iron box forward.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           For thirty years I have searched
           for you. In that time I built both
           an army and empire, but they are
           nothing compared to what we can
           create together. We can raise
           Acheron again. Never again will we
           hide like rats. Never again will we
           watch as our loved ones are
           slaughtered. I call forth the
           Queen. Stand and join me, and this
           day will have a joyous end.
                         
          No one moves.
                         
                          FASSIR
           You would have all the world
           suffer, as you have suffered. We
           will die before we help you.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Yes. You will.
                         
          He nods to his son. He paces in front of the female monks,
          the box in front of them.
           35.
                         
                         
                          FARIQ
           The caves beneath Khor Khalba
           contain all manner of creature,
           many -- altered -- by centuries of
           blood magic. But one, in
           particular, has developed a special
           connection to the blood. A thirst.
           It is said that only the Queen of
           Acheron itself can resist its
           embrace.
                         
          He stops, one woman away from Ilira.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           So what say you? Will you be the
           lucky one, or will you tell me who
           is?
                         
          A tear falls down her face, but she stays silent. There's the
          sound of SLITHERING as Fariq opens the box. She stares down
          inside the box --
                         
          AND SCREAMS.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She awakens to the SCREAMING of a whipped SLAVE GIRL.
                         
                         
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
          Tamara's eyes are met by a dozen others, SLAVES of every
          color, chained together with her in a CAGED WAGON. The SLAVE
          TRADER swings his whip twice more, hitting the cowering women
          in the cage.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           Wake up, slags! Smile! A new owner
           approaches!
                         
          Tamara makes eye contact with the Slave Trader.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Let me go. I promise you'll be
           rewarded.
                         
          The Trader just laughs, leering at her.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           And I would sample that reward,
           fair one, but you wear white.

           SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
           Tell me, have the stars aligned and
           delivered a virgin slave into my
           care?
                         
          He eyes her lasciviously. Tamara turns away and does not
          answer.
                         
           SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
           No matter. I'll know soon enough.
                          (TURNS AWAY)
           Good day, sir! A lone rider in a
           desolate land. The perfect customer
           for what I sell.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Rides out of the sun, his massive form silhouetted by the
          bright desert sky. He stares at the slave wagons.
                         
                          SHEMISH WOMAN
           Please, master! Your gold can free
           me from this hole! I can bring you
                          PLEASURE--
                         
          The Slave Trader immediately WHIPS her, incensed.
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           Silence whore!
                         
          The Slaver goes to whip her again, but before the blow can
          fall, Conan grabs his arm. The Slave Trader looks furious,
          but Conan's size holds him back.
                         
                          CONAN
           Khor Kalba. Which way?
                         
                          SLAVE TRADER
           This is the road to Khor Kalba.
           Ahead. Past the Great Wall.
                         
          The Slaver nods to the east and Conan releases his arm.
                         
          The Slaver continues whipping the slave. Conan just rides on -
          - not his problem.
                         
          But as Conan passes Tamara, for a brief moment their eyes
          meet. Something about her. Conan stares a moment, then spurs
          his horse on.
                         
          Just then, the ground around them RUMBLES. Horses rear, the
          women SCREAM. Conan turns and looks up. His eyes go wide.
                         
                         ENORMOUS BOULDERS
           37.
                         
                         
          Coming thundering down the hills on all sides. The SLAVERS
          see them a moment to late.
                         
          SLAM. Several of the horses and carts are smashed by the
          rolling boulders.
                         
          Conan kicks his horse, trying to outrace the boulders. But
          when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse
          in its side, and Conan goes down.
                         
          Pissed, he draws his sword. The Slavers scramble around the
          broken wagons, in chaos.
                         
          Only a pair of wagons still stands. One of them holds Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Use your whips on the horses' legs!
                         
          The Slavers are confused. Then they notice
                         
                         TURANIAN HORSEMEN
                         
          racing down the hill, behind the boulders.
                         
          As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as
          they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of
          horses, throwing their riders.
                         
          More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven
          into the desert floor. The remainder fight hand to hand, and
          are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.
          But their victory is short lived --
                         
          As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them,
          before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The
          riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it
          rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan
          launches himself down at the horsemen below.
                         
          WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square
          in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other
          riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He
          cuts them down where they sit.
                         
          The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team,
          trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see
          a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's
          decapitated.
           38.
                         
                         
          Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the
          wagon.
                         
                         REMO
                         
          The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS
          into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins,
          stopping the wagon.
                         
          Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You!
                         
          There's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW
          SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of
          the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have
          her FIGHT BACK.
                         
          Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head
          into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious
          from behind.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives
          and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very
          fast.
                         
          Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way.
                         
          The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off,
          speaking in the broken language of a savage.
                         
                          REMO
           The girl! Bring her to Khalar!
                         
          Conan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword
          and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword,
          preparing to cut Conan's throat --
                         
          When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge
          rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his
          grip.
                         
          Conan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE
          SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.
                         
          Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts
          as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.
           39.
                         
                         
          Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards
          the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY
          MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her,
          his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches
          out and breaks the lock on her chains.
                         
                          CONAN
           Who are you?
                         
                          TAMARA
           I am nobody.
                         
          He cuts the bonds on her feet. Tamara rises up, the battle
          scene revealed to her.
                         
          Dead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie sprawled
          in every direction. Tamara takes in the gruesome sight,
          shocked.
                         
                          CONAN
           Many died to capture nobody.
           (motions to his horse)
           Get up.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And if I don't wish to ride with
           you?
                         
                         
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
          Conan rides his horse, Tamara trailing on foot, wrists
          tethered to Conan's saddle by a long rope. Tamara looks
          exhausted.
                         
          They reach a gallery of broken columns, spires of fossilized
          coral that juts out of the desert.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop! I want water.
                         
          Conan just keeps riding.
                         
                          CONAN
           Perhaps the slavers took your
           orders. I don't.
           40.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           I never knew men could be so cruel.
           Now I wonder if the world is filled
           with animals such as you.
                         
                          CONAN
           You speak of animals as if they
           were less than men. But animals
           don't stab their brothers in the
           back or steal their mother's only
           possession. And they never lie.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I haven't lied.
                         
          Conan get off his horse, unties Tamara and gives her a water
          sack. Tamara greedily drinks down the water.
                         
                          CONAN
           Very well. Give me your name.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And
           you?
                         
                          CONAN
           I am Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan? That's it?
                         
                          CONAN
           What more names do I need?
                         
          Conan then grabs Tamara around her waist, putting her atop
          his horse. He then mounts behind her, their bodies close.
          Conan's mouth is only inches from her ear as he speaks.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           There is only one truth I need from
           you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why
           does Khalar Singh want you?
                         
          Tamara looks away, but doesn't respond.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Then let's hope it's for your
           cooking.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
                         
          A campfire amidst several large boulders, a line of windmills
          on the horizon.
           41.
                         
                         
          Tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over a blaze. Conan
          comes over and smells the pot; his face scrunches from the
          odor.
                         
                          CONAN
           Trying to poison me?
                         
          Tamara steps back and gets down on her knees, her hands
          clasped.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Before we eat, I must pray.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom! What would you pray for? That
           a bone may not get stuck in your
           throat? No words nor gods will give
           you one more moment than fate
           allows you.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then you have no faith. And I am
           sorry for you.
                         
                          CONAN
           I need no pity.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But you do. You live in a world
           that is harsh and short. Where fate
           is unyielding and hope is a cruel
           joke. I live in a world with a
           purpose that guides me, where faith
           sustains me.
                         
          Suddenly, Conan KICKS DIRT PAST TAMARA, ONTO THE FIRE. The
          fire goes out, plunging everything into darkness.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Why did you--
                         
          Suddenly, there's the sound of FIGHTING. Grunting, blows
          being interchanged, then a LOUD SNAP AS BONES ARE BROKEN.
                         
          A moment later, the flames of the fire are stoked up again,
          revealing Conan standing over the groaning REMO. The other
          two SHADOW SCOUTS are dead.
                         
          Tamara instinctively jumps back.
           42.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Don't worry. His back is broken. He
           won't be slinking away this time.
                         
          As Tamara gapes at Remo, Conan simply pulls the cooking pot
          off the fire.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Now, let's eat.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But -- what about him?!
                         
          Remo GROANS in pain.
                         
                          CONAN
           I enjoy a little music with my
           meal.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          AERIAL SHOT - POV - SOARING
                         
          Across steep valleys and up jagged peaks we race into steep
          and unforgiving mountains. Far off, we hear a pair of
          thunderous booms, almost like the sound of a heartbeat.
          THUMP, THUMP.
                         
          Cresting over a set of peaks, a gorge is revealed below, and
                         BENEATH IT--
                         
                         
          EXT. ACHERON - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          A city carved out of the purple granite of a mountainous
          gorge. Hundred-foot towers rise up, their pinnacles crafted
          to depict ANGRY, GOD-LIKE FACES.
                         
          As we pass one of the faces, again we hear the sound of a
          thunderous heartbeat, now closer. THUMP, THUMP.
                         
          We GLIDE DOWN past hundred foot high pillars of flames,
          towards the growing sounds of SCREAMING and WAILING.
                         
          The streets of Acheron are lined with thousands of SLAVES,
          young and old, chained together, toiling under the lash of
          their cruel masters, the
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          Towering over the slaves, the warriors are a fearsome sight.
          Their armor, crafted from the bones of their defeated
          enemies, rises to a mask which covers much of their features.
           43.
                         
                         
          Only the red irises of their eyes peer through. That and
          their pitch black skin.
                         
          The slaves hobble down the main boulevard, their naked feet
          splashing in streams of BLOOD which flow from the
                         
                         ACHERONIAN PYRAMID
                         
          Up ahead looms a colossal pyramid, surrounded in a semi-
          circle by five massive statues. As we grow closer the
          grotesque surface of the pyramid becomes clearer, one hewn
          from cracked bone and empty sockets.
                         
          The thunderous heartbeat seems all around us now. THUMP,
          THUMP.
                         
          The three hundred foot high edifice is made ENTIRELY OF
          THOUSANDS OF HUMAN SKULLS. Many of the skulls still drip with
          blood, pouring down from the pyramid's crest, where stands
                         
          A BLACK THRONE
                         
          Images of snakes gorging themselves on hapless victims are
          carved in bas relief into the throne's surface.
                         
          Standing before the throne, surrounded by BLACK ROBED PRIESTS
          are a man and woman, mere shadows in the silhouette of
          torches.
                         
          The HEAD PRIEST and his ACOLYTE approach with TWO CROWNS. One
          is made of GOLD, the other of IRON.
                         
          The Gold crown goes on the head of the man. For the woman,
          the Iron crown is placed on her head.
                         
          And suddenly, THUMP, THUMP. IRON SPIKES SHOOT OUT OF THE IRON
          CROWN PIERCING THE WOMAN'S FOREHEAD, HER SCREAMS ECHOES
          THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
                         
          Blood streams down the woman's face as she turns toward the
          torchlight.
                         
          IT IS TAMARA.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara leaps up, startled. Her face is covered in sweat, her
          eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream.
                         
          Nearby we hear screaming of another type. Remo.
           44.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT
                         
          MUFFLED SCREAMS. We pull out of Remo's wide mouth, stuffed
          with cloth, trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony.
                         
          A hand comes in and pulls out the cloth. It's Conan.
                         
                          REMO
           Please! Mercy!
                         
                          CONAN
           You are more fit to inflict torture
           than to endure it. Your life is not
           nailed to your spine as my peoples
           are.
                         
          We PULL OUT, revealing that Remo arms are spread-eagle,
          attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs.
                         
          Conan nudges him with the point of his sword. Remo SCREAMS in
          agony, then speaks in his savage, broken dialect.
                         
                          REMO
           Stop! Stop! I know how make you
           rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar
           Singh? You have what he want. The
           girl, yes? Khalar give you anything
           for her. More!
                         
                          CONAN
           Why would he?
                         
          Remo pauses, not wanting to answer. Conan put the blade back
          to Remo's neck.
                         
                          REMO
           She could be the one.
                         
                          CONAN
           One what?
                         
                          REMO
           The one. The Queen.
                         
          Conan's mind races, remembering Khalar's words from long ago.
                         
                          CONAN
           A queen in hiding.
                         
                          REMO
           Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring
           her. He wait for me now, at Great
           Wall. He pay you anything. More!
           45.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           So I should ransom her to your
           master? Not exactly loyal -- but
           still, a good idea.
                         
          Conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper from Remo's
          tunic.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You'll help me deliver it.
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
                         
          Torchlight dots the heights of a fifty-foot high stone wall,
          erected between giant rock formations, an impassable barrier
          that runs countless miles.
                         
          The wreckage of old siege equipment dots the hillside before
          the wall.
                         
                         
          EXT. CATAPULT - NIGHT
                         
          An aging catapult looks down upon the wall below. Slowly, it
          begins to turn.
                         
          Conan pushes the catapult until it aims towards the Great
          Wall.
                         
          We hear MUFFLED SCREAMS, and find Remo tied to a boulder
          cradled in the catapult. Conan pulls the gag out of Remo's
          mouth.
                         
                          REMO
           Please! Please! I help you! I do
           anything you wish!
                         
          Conan stuffs a parchment in his mouth. He takes out his sword
          and cuts another NOTCH into his arm.
                         
                          CONAN
           Good. Die.
                         
          He then cuts the rope and WHOOSH! The catapult fires tossing
          Remo and the rock he's tied to high into the night sky.
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
                         
          BOOM! Patrolling SOLDIERS are crushed beneath the massive
          rock as it reduces a section of wall to rubble.

          Stares down at Remo's broken body. Ukafa and Fariq stand
          beside him.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He brought a message?
                         
          Ukafa hands him the bloodied parchment. Khalar reads it.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for
           me to deliver in person.
                         
                          UKAFA
           I'll find them -- and come back
           with their heads.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You let the girl escape once,
           Ukafa. What makes you think you can
           do better now?
                         
                          UKAFA
           I did what?
                         
                          FARIQ
           I found the monastery. It was my
           understanding that you were in
           charge of its capture --
                         
          Ukafa's anger grows.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Enough! We will take no chances. We
           will pay this thief what he wants,
           and more.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan returns from the nearby hills, carrying a pair of
          rabbits he's hunted and skinned.
                         
          He looks around, surprised not to find Tamara. He hears a
          yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the
          clearing.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's tied up and gagged and she's wormed her way this far,
          muddying and scraping herself all along the way. She lets out
          a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her back up and
          carries her back to the outcropping.
           47.
                         
                         
          He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at
          her feet.
                         
                          CONAN
           Here. Eat.
                         
          Tamara squirms away from the carcass, disgusted.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Couldn't you at least cook it
           first?
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire draws attention.
                         
          Conan tears into his rabbit, chewing on the raw meat.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Does it bother you, blood on your
           hands?
                         
                          CONAN
           The only blood on these hands I
           claimed with my own sword.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What does that mean?
                         
                          CONAN
           Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and
           Queens claim more lives than I will
           ever meet, and not a drop is
           spilled in their presence.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What are you talking about? I've
           done no harm to you. I've done no
           harm to anyone.
                         
          Conan confronts her, enraged.
                         
                          CONAN
           You lie. You are the very reason my
           people are dead.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Are you mad? I never met your
           people.
                         
                          CONAN
           But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed
           my people, looking for you.
                         
          Suddenly Tamara understands.
           48.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           The one who came for us? His name
           is Khalar Singh?
                         
                          CONAN
           You know this.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We did not know who sought us, only
           that we were sought.
                         
                          CONAN
           You hid from him. And while you
           did, others died in your place.
                         
                          TAMARA
           If we did not hide, countless more
           would have been killed! You do not
           know what purpose he has for our
           queen.
                         
                          CONAN
           And I do not care, for he will not
           live to see it bear fruit!
                         
          Tamara is shocked.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Wait -- you seek to kill this
           Khalar? We have the same aim. He
           takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I
           have sworn an oath to protect her.
           I can help you.
                         
                          CONAN
           Enough lies.
                         
          Conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROCK RIDGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan watches the Great Wall silently, absently playing with
          a DAGGER in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along
          the wall. The archers. The barrels of oil. The cavalry.
                         
          He feels eyes upon him and looks down at Tamara, still bound
          and gagged, her eyes burning holes in his forehead. Conan
          pulls out her gag.
                         
                          CONAN
           You will keep quiet.
           49.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           What use is talking? You won't
           believe a word I speak. I only want
           to know this -- how will you kill
           Khalar? You are too big to play the
           assassin.
                         
                          CONAN
           You will be the lure that will draw
           me close. Then I will scale the
           wall and cut him down where he
           stands.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And the archers and cavalry? They
           will be napping?
                         
                          CONAN
           They will not be a problem.
                         
          Tamara thinks about it.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. Not good enough.
                         
          Conan is shocked by her brazen response.
                         
                          CONAN
           Did I ask?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Should you fail, I'll be left
           without a weapon, helpless in my
           enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.
                         
          Conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth.
                         
                          CONAN
           I will not fail.
                         
          But still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of
          Conan's resolve bending.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. GREAT WALL - DAY
                         
          Khalar Singh stands atop the wall, awaiting Conan. Fariq
          draws close.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Let me take care of this thief,
           father. He's beneath your notice.
           50.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He killed Remo, likely his cavalry
           legion as well. Whatever he is, he
           is more than a mere thief.
                         
          Then, off in the distance, at the far edge of the desert
          clearing, two figures step out from amongst the boulders.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA
                         
          Conan holds a squirming, but bound Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Be still!
                         
          Conan thrusts Tamara in Khalar's direction.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           (yelling to Khalar)
           I have what you want! Where's my
           gold?!
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (YELLING BACK)
           Triple your price. Come and claim
           it.
                         
          GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA
                         
          stand a hundred feet ahead.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Send her to me.
                         
                          CONAN
           Send the gold.
                         
          Khalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between
          them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged.
                         
          But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --
                         
          From out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of
          the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked
          lances, and they surround Conan.
           51.
                         
                         
          The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE
          HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the
          rider's skull with his broadsword.
                         
          The next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their
          nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into
          the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first
          rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the
          second rider's neck.
                         
          The last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT
          THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both
          human and animal head tumble to the desert floor.
                         
          All four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Smiles. He's got Tamara by the neck.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You're fast. But are you fast
           enough?
                         
          Conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his
          archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming
          arrows stream toward him.
                         
          EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a
          huge dust cloud.
                         
          Conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack.
                         
          But Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the
          gates.
                         
          Baring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself.
                         
          Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who
          evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword.
                         
          Explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he
                         REACHES
                         
          THE GREAT WALL
                         
          Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a
          mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking
          half the vertical of the wall in a single leap.
                         
          Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops
          only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two
          upward bounds.
           52.
                         
                         
                         WALL WALK
                         
          Conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great
          Wall.
                         
                         FARIQ
                         
          Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan
          takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You should have run, while you
           could.
                         
          Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS
          THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the
          slight Fariq.
                         
          Fariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well-
          trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade
          cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fariq!
                         
          Khalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and
          flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to
          stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment.
                         
          Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall
          walk.
                         
                          CONAN
           I was wondering what it would take
           for you to stop cowering.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I wasn't cowering. I was studying.
           You're quite gifted with a sword,
           but it's not from schooling. Your
           speed and power makes up for a lack
           of -- finesse. I've seen such
           fighting before -- Cimmerian.
                         
          Enraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar
          Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds
          nothing but air. Khalar is fast.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Cimmerian it is. Now it makes
           sense. You came for blood, not
           gold.
           53.
                         
                         
          Conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a
          broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space,
          Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's
          attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his
          tulwar.
                         
          Conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have
          just as easily sliced his throat.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Your people barely afforded me a
           challenge. You're little more than
           beasts.
                         
          Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing
          entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades
          the attack.
                         
          Down the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar
          seems complacent enough just to defend.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           You've come a long way, barbarian,
           only to fail.
                         
          Khalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice,
          both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan,
          sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet.
                         
          CRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword
          clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a
          circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours.
                         
          Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off
          the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating
          punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.
          CRUNCH.
                         
          Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           So much for vengeance.
           (to his soldiers)
           Get me oil -- and a torch.
                         
          Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Is that really the best you could
           do? Is that as far as you could
           think ahead? Just rush in and kill
           me?
           54.
                         
                         
          Behind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her
          hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as
          well.
                         
                         TAMARA' HANDS
                         
          Between the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S
          DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds.
                         
          With all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick
          enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER,
          LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER.
                         
          Cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched
          arrows.
                         
                          CHEREN
           No!!
                         
          But it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan.
          BOOM.
                         
                         EXPLOSION
                         
          The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction.
          Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the
          concussion.
                         
          Khalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is
          THROWN AGAINST THE WALL!
                         
                         KHALAR SINGH
                         
          The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the
          explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire.
                         
          He grits his teeth and climbs the wall.
                         
          ATOP THE WALL
                         
          A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara
          are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two
          figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara
          holding Conan atop the horse.
                         
          Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Ukafa, you will take half our
           forces North, to the Sea. I will
           take the rest South.
                         
                          FARIQ
           What of me, father?
           55.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You will return to Khor Kalba. You
           will feed the women to the beast
           until you find our Queen.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I will not. I will track the
           barbarian with you --
                         
          Enraged, Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head,
          pulling him in close.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You think I care what you wish?!
           You want to play warrior? It is not
           in you. One day you will be king,
           but warlord, never.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I can. Let me prove it to you!
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You will not risk your life again.
           You are my line, my successor. You
           will not throw away all that I have
           worked for.
                         
          A smile creeps up on Ukafa's face, watching Fariq's
          embarrassment. He withdraws hastily, all eyes on him.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           (without looking at Ukafa)
           If I find you smiling before you
           bring me the girl, I will take
           every tooth I see.
                         
          Ukafa buries the smile as Khalar turns to the wall of flames
          left in Conan's wake.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          The flames become the blaze of the forge.
                         
           CORIN (O.S.)
           More wood boy! We must test the
           steel with our fire.
                         
          Conan, a young boy again, kneels beside the woodpile, pulling
                         OUT LOGS--
           56.
                         
                         
          But when he hands them to his father, he notices his father
          is covered with sword wounds, cut and bleeding.
                         
                          CORIN (CONT'D)
           What are you waiting for? The fire
           is dying.
                         
          Conan turns back to the wood pile. Instead of wood, the pile
          is full of the bodies of those he recently killed: Lucius,
          Remo, etc.
                         
          The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the
          forge. Still the fire diminishes.
                         
          Conan turns and there is no more wood. And no more bodies.
                         
                          CONAN
           It's not enough. I've failed you
           father.
                         
                          CORIN
           It will never be enough, Conan.
                         
                          CONAN
           I don't understand --
                         
          He spins. Behind him TAMARA stands, a look of sadness on her
          face.
                         
                          CORIN
           Through suffering, you will learn
           your purpose, boy. And you have not
           begun to suffer yet.
                         
                         
          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Conan's eyes pop open. He inhales sharply, gripped by the
          dream.
                         
          The room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies. Conan lies
          on a straw bed with white sheets, soaked through with his
          sweat. He looks to his wounds, all bandaged.
                         
          He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I wouldn't move so fast. I bound
           your wounds as best I could, but
           I'm no healer.
                         
          Conan looks over to discover Tamara sitting nearby.
           57.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Where am I?
                         
                          TAMARA
           On the Wasp. You told me where it
           laid, just before you passed out.
           Though I can't say as I feel much
           safer here.
                         
          Conan's response is to rise again, his face contorting in
          pain.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Don't embarrass me with thanks, I
           only saved your life.
                         
                          CONAN
           You were -- adequate.
                         
          Conan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround
          his bed. Behind it lies a staircase, which he ascends.
                         
                         
          EXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          Conan steps out onto the deck of a sixty-foot djunk,
          traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Look what we have here. A hill ape
           in over his head.
                         
          Conan spins to see the rough, brightly dressed Zamoran pirate
          ARTUS leaping down from the quarterdeck, his sword out.
                         
          The other ZAMORAN PIRATES draw near as well. Tamara sees the
          scene, suddenly uncomfortable.
                         
                          CONAN
           I was just wondering what that
           smell was.
           (sniffs near Artus)
           Now I know.
                         
                          ARTUS
           We take no stowaways. Only paying
           passengers. You've best be laden
           with gold.
                         
                          CONAN
           If it's metal you seek, perhaps
           you'd settle for steel.
           58.
                         
                         
          In a flash Conan's sword lunges forward. CLANG. It meets
          Artus's, sparking as they collide. Artus LAUGHS.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Still fast Artus.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly
           handsome.
           (to the pirates)
           All hail Conan!
                         
                          PIRATES
           All hail Conan!
                         
          Artus slaps his hand on Conan's back and Conan winces in
          pain.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Sorry, friend. Looks like you've
           had a rough road.
                         
                          CONAN
           It won't get easier. Khalar Singh
           lives. He'll be coming for me and
           the girl.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Good. We're scrapping for a fight
           these days.
                         
                          CONAN
           This one may be more than you wish.
           I need you to get me close to Khor
           Kalba.
                         
          Artus rubs his beard.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Rest up. We'll get you there.
                         
          Conan withdraws to his room.
                         
                         
          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Conan collapses on the bed as Tamara follows him inside.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We go to Khor Kalba?
                         
                          CONAN
           I do.
           59.
                         
                         
          Conan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. We do.
                         
                          CONAN
           Just leave me to sleep.
                         
          But Tamara doesn't leave, forcing Conan to respond.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           You would risk your life for
           royalty? Why?
                         
          Tamara pauses, realizing she must trust Conan to gain his
          help.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Because she represent freedom, not
           just ours but all Hyboria's. What
           do you know of Acheron?
                         
                          CONAN
           A tall tale. Meant to scare
           children.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It is no fable. It's my people's
           history. Acheron was an empire that
           swallowed all of Hyboria, led by
           the King and his legion of demon
           warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.
           Immortal. But still it had one
           weakness. For the true power of
           Acheron laid not with its King, but
           the Queen. Every twenty years, a
           new queen from the royal line would
           be coronated with a crown of iron.
           Spikes would pierce her, slowly
           drain her precious blood, and
           through her suffering Acheron would
           remain invincible. Until one of my
           ancestors, an Acheronian himself,
           put a stop to this tyranny. He and
           others spirited the new Queen away,
           hiding her from the empire and all
           those who would raise it again.
                         
                          CONAN
           What care I for queens and empires?
                         
          Conan turns to head back to his bed. Tamara grabs him,
          incensed.
           60.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Didn't you hear me? This evil faces
           us all. All of civilization will
           fall if the army of Acheron is
           raised again.
                         
                          CONAN
           I heard. Only I would happily put
           all of your "civilization" to the
           torch myself.
                         
                          TAMARA
           But -- you owe me a debt, you
           thankless oaf!
                         
                          CONAN
           My only debt is to my people. And
           it still lies unpaid.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAN OF WAR - NIGHT
                         
          The enormous siege vessel lies before a burning PORT CITY.
                         
          A SAILOR, crying, grovels on his knees before Khalar and his
          men.
                         
                          SAILOR
           It was a pirate ship. They left as
           soon as the girl and the large one
           boarded.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Which way did they sail?
                         
                          SAILOR
           North.
                         
          Khalar is surprised.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Are you certain?
                         
                          SAILOR
           Yes, please, I'm telling you the
           truth!
                         
          Khalar nods to one of his men, who slits the Sailor's throat.
                         
          Khalar turns to his FALCONER, with the huge bird of prey on
          his arm.
           61.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Send word to Ukafa. They come to
           him by sea.
                         
          The Falconer nods and heads off. Khalar looks to his
          soldiers.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Find me a warship.

          EXT. GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          The ship sails like a ghost over black water, the stars lit
          up impossibly bright. Artus finds Tamara sitting near the
          bow. He hands her a steaming bowl of food.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Try not to taste it going down
           would be my advice.
                         
                          TAMARA
           You've known Conan long?
                         
                          ARTUS
           We sailed with him for a while. I
           would like to say I know the man.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He is a riddle to me.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Aye, he's that too.
                         
                          TAMARA
           We have the same goal. Why will he
           not trust me?
                         
                          ARTUS
           Why would he? He's a stranger in
           every land he trods. A man with no
           home, no people, none but the
           company of ghosts. And he bears the
           weight of their deaths every moment
           of every day.
                         
                          TAMARA
           That is no way to live.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ARTUS
           He doesn't live. I've seen in him
           great mirth, only to watch it
           smothered by greater melancholy. He
           owes a blood debt, and he can
           entertain no other joy, no other
           cause, until it is fulfilled.
                         
                          TAMARA
           And yet you call him friend, and
           risk death to help him.
                         
                         
                          ARTUS
           Let me tell you something of Conan.
           He will never lie. He will never
           break a trust, once given. And he
           will never, ever give up.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He's a stubborn ass.
                         
          Artus LAUGHS.
                         
                          ARTUS
           He is that, lass. He is that.

          INT. DUNGEON - THE PIT - NIGHT
                         
          AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a
          large circular chamber, lit by many torches. Before them lies
          a PIT, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop
          it.
                         
          Fariq enters, an AIDE holding the iron box he used earlier.
          Fariq has a bandage on his face where Conan struck him, and
          he looks even more angry and malevolent than before.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Here we stand again. Will the queen
           reveal herself, or must another
           innocent suffer?
                         
          Fariq walks past the row of women, each recoiling. He slaps
          one. Then another, his rage only building.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           My father, he tires of your
           charade. He grows impatient. But I
           have no such haste. I enjoy
           watching you squirm.
           63.
                         
                         
          Fariq passes Ilira, slowing his pace. He closes in on the
          YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK, a true innocent with terrified eyes.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           Perhaps you'd like to see the end
           your sisters faced back at the
           monastery?
                         
          Fariq slowly opens the box before her.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN BOX
                         
          In the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque TENTACLE. The
          tentacle is severed, but still alive, thirsting for blood.
                         
          Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq
          closes the box.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           No? Your fear is not enough yet?
           Let's try harder.
                         
          Fariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           I've read all there is to know of
           mighty Acheron. Why would true
           Acheronians protect a traitor to
           their own? You once held the entire
           world in your grasp, now you hide
           and cower like pitiful mice.
                         
          He pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing
          down into the pit.
                         
          AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes.
          The girl looks below.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           And mice are meant to be swallowed
           whole.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one
          in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the
          young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the
          darkness below.
                         
          Her SCREAMS echo.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           What was in the box could only
           drink from you one at a time. But
           the beast of Acheron, it will claim
           four of you this night.

           Who will spare the rest and tell me
           which of you is the queen?
                         
          Not a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself,
          but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at
          her.
                         
          CU - ILIRA'S EYES
                         
          Her pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into
          her.
                         
           FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
           I am here, swine.
                         
          Fariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at
          him.
                         
                          FEMALE MONK
           I am the one you seek.
                         
          Fariq smiles.
                         
                          FARIQ
           At last. Some bravery. But of
           course, you wouldn't expect me to
           take your word, would you?
                         
          As the Fariq reaches for her--
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. GALLEY - ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara awakens with a SCREAM, her body resting against the
          curved hull of the ship.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No!!!
                         
          Tamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes
          where she is.
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           I hope I awoke with less clamor.
                         
          Their roles reversed, now it is Tamara's turn to see Conan
          sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead.
                         
                          TAMARA
           You're drinking? You were near
           death this time yesterday.
           65.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Is there a better reason to drink?
                         
          Tamara actually manages to LAUGH.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Do you think--I could try some of
           that? I'm curious of its taste.
                         
                          CONAN
           You've never tasted mead?
                         
          Tamara shrugs, embarrassed. Conan hands her flask. She takes
          a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. But she
          doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It's good.
                         
          Conan reaches for the flask, but Tamara ignores him, taking
          another swig. It quickly loosens her tongue.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Let me ask you something. Once
           you've killed Khalar and claimed
           your vengeance, then what? You will
           be free from your ghosts. What of
           your future, Conan?
                         
                          CONAN
           I have no future. It died with my
           people, as I should have.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So your life is penance? For what,
           for living? And when you too die,
           what do you believe happens then?
                         
          Conan just shrugs, taking back the mead.
                         
                          CONAN
           Nothing.
                         
          Tamara, her tongue loosened by drink, laughs.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Nothing? I couldn't live without
           some kind of belief in the world
           after this.
                         
                          CONAN
           I believe in the cold of steel, the
           warmth of flesh. All else is fairy
           tales.
           66.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Perhaps. But I still die with faith
           in my heart, belief in something
           greater than one's self. What will
           you die with?
                         
                          CONAN
           Purpose. I die with purpose.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - MORNING
                         
          Tamara steps out onto the deck, grabbing her pounding head.
          Her first hangover. She hears a THUMPING sound, followed by
          ANOTHER, and walks towards the side of the deck.
                         
          Tamara looks overboard, to the water below.
                         
                         TAMARA'S POV
                         
          THE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES! Bloated, they float in blood
          red water as flies buzz around them. One of them hits the
          hull of the boat. THUMP.
                         
          Tamara blinks, unsure if the vision is real -- but then she's
          joined by other PIRATES who gape at the bodies below.
                         
                          PIRATE 1
           To stations! To stations!
                         
          Tamara turns and up ahead spies --
                         
                         BLACK WARSHIP
                         
          The larger warship cuts through the water, manned by a legion
          of rowers. On the deck of the warship, UKAFA and his SPEARMEN
          stand. The SAILORS get the most out of the billowing black
          sails. The ship gains fast.
                         
                         THE GALLEY
                         
          Conan exits his room, sees the danger. Artus appears at his
          side.
                         
                          ARTUS
           What do you think? They have us
           outnumbered, but we might beat
           their speed.
           67.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           That is what they wish. They drive
           us to another force, approaching
           from the south.
                         
                          ARTUS
           Then we fight?
                         
                          CONAN
           No. We give them what they think
           they want.
           (to the Pirates)
           About ship! Now!
                         
          The pirates leap into action, tacking and turning the galley
          with great speed and efficiency.
                         
                         THE WARSHIP
                         
          Ukafa smiles, his gold teeth shining. The ship's CAPTAIN
          stands beside him.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           They're turning to run.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Good. We only need stay close.
                         
                         THE GALLEY
                         
          Is turned around now, fleeing. ARCHERS from the Warship fire
          arrows that barely reach the Galley. The Pirates dodge the
          few that land on deck.
                         
          Tamara reaches Conan and Artus. She's worried to say the
          least.
                         
                          ARTUS
           And now?
                         
                          CONAN
           Let us show them why she is called
           the Wasp.
                         
          Artus smiles. He was hoping Conan would say that.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Why is she called the Wasp?
                         
                          ARTUS
           Open astern! Load the stinger!
                         
          The Pirates rush to the back of the ship.
           68.
                         
                         
          THE BLACK WARSHIP
                         
          The Captain stares ahead, confused.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           They are doing -- something.
                         
          Sure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing -
                         
          A MASSIVE CROSSBOW
                         
          Mounted with a barbed harpoon, fifteen feet long.
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire!
                         
          They fire the weapon. The harpoon races for the bow of the
          Warship, a thick rope trailing it. It smashes into the wood,
          ripping through it like it was paper.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Rip her apart!
                         
          The Pirates grab the heavy rope and run, pulling the rope,
          and the harpoon back towards the Wasp.
                         
          As it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole
          in the warship.
                         
                         WARSHIP
                         
          The Captain and crew are in a panic. Men rush to patch the
          gaping hole in the hull.
                         
                          SAILOR
           We're taking on water!
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           Hard to port!
                         
                          UKAFA
           No. Let them fire again!
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           We will sink.
                         
          Ukafa guts the captain with his spear.
                         
                          UKAFA
           So be it.
           (to his spearmen)
           Get below. Be ready.
                         
                         GALLEY
           69.
                         
                         
          The pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second
          time.
                         
                          CONAN
           Fire!
                         
          It fires, smashing again into the wooden hull of the Warship.
                         
          WARSHIP - INSIDE
                         
          The harpoon lodges deep inside the hull -- where Ukafa and
          his spearmen wait.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Now!
                         
          They rush forward and grab onto the harpoon.
                         
                         GALLEY
                         
                          ARTUS
           Bring her back!
                         
          Again, the pirates pull the harpoon back out. It falls into
          the water as they pull on the rope tied to it.
                         
          They do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the
          very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley.
                         
          Artus looks at the Warship. It's foundering and sinking
          quickly.
                         
                          ARTUS (CONT'D)
           She's dead in the water!
                         
          A CHEER goes up among the pirates --
                         
          And then one PIRATE takes a spear through the chest. All eyes
          turn to the side of the Wasp, where Ukafa and his men climb
          aboard.
                         
          Conan's eyes alight with fury.
                         
                          CONAN
           Good. I was growing weary with
           boredom.
                         
          Conan motions to a pair of pirates.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Hide her below.
                         
                         BATTLE
           70.
                         
                         
          The Spearmen rush to the attack. The pirates spring to the
          defense of the ship, countering the Spearmen with cutlass and
          dagger. Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Find the girl!
                         
          The Spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the
          galley, throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan grabs the nearby jib, swings over, and plants both feet
          in the face of one of the spearmen, knocking him over the
          side.
                         
                         ARTUS
                         
          The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing
          the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it down
          to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the Spearman's eye on a
          handspike.
                         
                         UKAFA
                         
          The massive warrior shows incredible speed as well, dodging
          one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another
          pirate.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          The Cimmerian cuts through a Spearman, his gaze focused on
          Ukafa. Ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of
          pirates. Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart.
                         
          The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. Ukafa's
          frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           We are each the last of our tribe,
           Cimmerian. Yours dies this day.
                         
          Conan responds by lunging forward, swinging his sword in a
          broad arc. Ukafa is just as quick, stepping back and allowing
          his spear to block the swing.
                         
          Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles, forcing Conan to
          parry, stepping back beyond the spear's reach.
                         
          The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth, neither
          able to gain the advantage.
           71.
                         
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           Your head will top my spear today,
           but know Khalar's pig son will soon
           share your fate.
                         
          Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest, and Conan
          decides to drop his sword, grabbing the spear as it passes by
          him.
                         
          Conan then pulls on the spear, throwing Ukafa off his
          balance, towards Conan. Conan then kicks the warrior in the
          chest, hurtling Ukafa backwards.
                         
          Now Conan turns the spear on its master. Ukafa, unarmed, is
          forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him. A pair
          of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and
          arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.
                         
          The battle goes to hand-to-hand. It's primal, each of them
          covered in blood. Ukafa bear hugs Conan, then resorts to
          using his teeth to bite into Conan's shoulder.
                         
          Conan YELLS IN PAIN, butting Ukafa's head and knocking him
          back. Conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against
          the harpoon crossbow.
                         
          Ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby. He
          picks it up.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           Now finally, you die.
                         
          He raises up to hurl the spear through Conan, only to see
          Conan manning the harpoon, NOW TURNED TO FACE UKAFA.
                         
          The crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole
          through Ukafa, its momentum throwing him off the galley, into
          the sea beyond.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She hides inside a small compartment of the ship. She hears
          FOOTSTEPS walking past, then returning. An ARM suddenly
          reaches in and grabs her.
                         
          As she's pulled out, Tamara SCREAMS right in Conan's face. He
          doesn't even flinch.
                         
                          CONAN
           Time to go.
           72.
                         
                         
          EXT. GALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          The battle ended, the pirates toss the dead Spearmen into the
          sea and prepare to make sail again.
                         
          Meanwhile, Conan lashes his sword to his back, standing by
          the gunwales with Tamara and Artus, a SMALL DINGHY waiting
          below.
                         
                          ARTUS
           I could get you closer. Another
           half day along the coast --
                         
                          CONAN
           I need you head west, to draw off
           our pursuers. I'll find another
           path to Khor Kalba.
                         
                          ARTUS
           So be it. Swift wind at your backs.
                         
                         
          EXT. DINGHY - DAY
                         
          Conan rows away from the galley with powerful strokes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So you are taking me with you to
           Khor Kalba.
                         
                          CONAN
           I never said that. But I won't
           leave a virgin onboard a pirate
           ship, alone.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I -- but -- who said I was a
           virgin?
                         
          Conan just shakes his head as a parting fog reveals a large
          Colossus head, the fallen remains of an enormous statue,
          lying agape on the shoreline.
                         
                         
          INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - DUSK
                         
          Conan pulls off his jerkin, revealing a torso rippling with
          muscles.
                         
                          CONAN
           We'll rest here until morning.
           73.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Will I awake alone? Do you intend
           to leave me?
                         
                          CONAN
           I would do you a kindness. Khor
           Kalba will bring only death.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Please, Conan. Artus told me of how
           you lost your tribe. I too had to
           watch as my people were taken from
           me.
                         
          Conan ignores her, gathering wood for a fire.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           All I ask is that you let me travel
           with you. I too have a purpose. I
           must get to the queen. I would
           rather you kill me here, than fail
           her again.
                         
          Conan continues collecting, infuriating Tamara.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I was wrong about you. You are no
           fearless warrior. Your heart is
           closed to all but fear -- and hate.
                         
          Conan draws flint, starting the fire. Only once his task is
          complete does he answer Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           We leave at dawn. I will not break
           stride for you. Not once. I will
           get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond
           that I have my purpose, and you
           yours.
                         
          Tamara offers a thankful nod, her anger subsiding.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Nice fire. Does it mean you'll
           actually cook the meat this time?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. KHALAR SINGH'S WARSHIP - DUSK
                         
          Khalar looks at the destruction of Ukafa's warship, the
          bodies filling the water. Khalar spots Ukafa's dead body
          floating there, harpoon still lodged in his chest.
           74.
                         
                         
          The ship's CAPTAIN approaches.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           The pirate ship sailed to the west.
           Even under full sail it'll be no
           easy task to overtake her.
                         
          Just then, a FALCON approaches. The Falconer retrieves it, a
          parchment tied to its talon. He passes it on to Khalar Singh.
                         
          Khalar Singh reads it, a smile creeping upon his face.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fariq has done well.
           (to the Captain)
           Head east, back to Khor Kalba.
                         
                          CAPTAIN
           But our chase points the other way.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           The chase is over. They come to me
           now.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY
                         
          Tamara watches Conan from a distance. He silently stalks prey
          with nothing more than a knife.
                         
                         A BOAR
                         
          Its ears listen intently, aware. Suddenly, it bolts.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Is just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting
          course with the great beast. He leaps over a fallen log,
          throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm.
                         
          The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan
          walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as
          he mercifully SNAPS its neck.
                         
                         
          INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - NIGHT
                         
          The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire. Conan
          turns the meat.
                         
          Behind him, Tamara approaches. She has cleaned herself up,
          her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair
          glistening.
           75.
                         
                         
          Conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. He
          stops chewing.
                         
          Tamara notices. Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only
          see her side. Conan returns to his food.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What were the women of your tribe
           like, Conan?
                         
                          CONAN
           They fought beside the men.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So they were equals. And your
           mother?
                         
                          CONAN
           She died in battle, even as I was
           born.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So you never knew her. It was the
           same with me. I've always known
           being a mother was somehow not my
           fate. But--
                         
          Tamara falters, unsure. But Conan's quiet eases her.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           You said earlier Khor Kalba will
           bring only death. Were you trying
           to scare me, or do you really
           believe our end lies there?
                         
                          CONAN
           I don't lie.
                         
          Tamara nods, having heard as much about Conan. She turns back
          to face him, no longer hiding her body.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then we don't have much time. Your
           mother perished too young, but at
           least she died having known the
           touch of one who cared.
                         
          Tamara steps closer to Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           So -- do you care, Conan?
                         
          Conan rises to her, his broad form looming over her slight
          build.
           76.
                         
                         
          But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe
          and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a
          desperate kiss.
                         
                         LOVE SCENE
                         
          Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs
          intertwined, fingers locked together. He thrusts into her,
          causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain.
                         
          The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top, undulating as
          their pace quickens. Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy.
                         
                         AFTERMATH
                         
          Tamara stares into the fire, her body wrapped around Conan's.
          She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I've only ever heard you speak of
           what you'd die for, Conan. What
           would you live for?
                         
          Conan, his eyes closed, keeps them shut.
                         
                          CONAN
           Do you ever tire of talking? Let me
           rest, woman.
                         
          Tamara reaches down between Conan's legs. His eyes open.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I thought that may work.
                         
          Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara. Looking down at
          her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the
          soft glow of the firelight.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I see you clearly now, finally,
           after all this time.
           (she kisses him deeply)
           I would be that which you live for,
           Conan, if you would have me. You
           may have faith in nothing, Conan --
           but I have faith in you.
                         
          Conan lowers himself back down upon her.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
           77.
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY
                         
          Conan powers his way to the top of a high ridge, spotting
          down in the vista below:
                         
                         KHOR KALBA
                         
          Surrounded on three sides by the coastline, the stone
          fortress of Khalar Singh rests on a plateau, overlooking a
          bustling, tented city below.
                         
          Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their way
          towards town, driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem.
                         
                          CONAN
           We'll slip in, along with those
           traders. But you'll need a change
           of clothes, those monks' robes will
           draw attention.
                         
          Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What will I wear?
                         
                         
          EXT. KHOR KHALBA - ENTRANCE - DAY
                         
          The caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city,
          guarded by Khalar's troops. Blended in amongst the others,
          Conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of
          Shemish traders, obscuring all but his eyes.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl, her taut body
          barely covered by silken drapings. She glares at Conan,
          miserable.
                         
                          TAMARA
           I don't understand why I couldn't
           be dressed as you are. I look like
           a whore.
                         
                          CONAN
           And what better disguise for a
           monk?
                         
          Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster. The
          Camel BRAYS and rears. Conan yanks harder and the camel flies
          forward, its eyes wide.
                         
          Conan meets its eye.
           78.
                         
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Do not test me, beast.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Is there not a living thing you can
           be at peace with?
                         
          They ride into the city, past the troops.
                         
                         
          EXT. KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE - DAY
                         
          Conan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a
          otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled
          faces and not a hint of morality.
                         
                         STRANGER
                         
          A FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and
          Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them.
                         
                         WOODEN PLATFORM
                         
          The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the
          plateau. There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a
          massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising
          back up to the fortress above.
                         
                          CONAN
           It's probably only way into
           Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is
           heavily guarded at all times, day
           and night.
                         
                          TAMARA
           So we must try to scale the cliff.
                         
                          CONAN
           And dodge arrows as we do so?
                         
          Conan motions up to the winch. Standing beside it are a half
          dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           During the day, we'd easily be
           spotted on the climb. And it would
           be useless to even attempt at
           night. No, we must find another
           way.
                         
                         STRANGER'S POV
                         
          As Conan continues around the base of the mesa, the Figure
          following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS.
           79.
                         
                         
                         ALLEYWAY
                         
          Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village
          when a VOICE rings out behind them.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Halt.
                         
          Conan spins, sword at the ready. From out of the shadows
          comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Thieves. You'll regret finding me.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I think not.
                         
          From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same
          one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings. He smiles at
          Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           It took longer than you think to
           cut this out of Lucius' stomach.
           After all that work, I figured I'd
           keep it -- for old times' sake.
                         
                         
          INT. THIEVES' TAVERN - AFTERNOON
                         
          A rundown hall, built beneath the city. Wooden supports hold
          up the buildings of the entire city block overhead.
                         
          And within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES.
          They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or
          even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice.
                         
          They eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and
          SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian
          outsider.
                         
          The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and
          immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan,
          caressing him.
                         
          Tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even
          as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table.
                         
          Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile
          women, their breasts practically framing his face.
           80.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           What? Do you wish to join in?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the
          One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           --so you were right about the
           platform. You'll be long dead
           before you make it top. Same with
           scaling the cliff. There's no known
           way to break into the fortress.
                         
                          CONAN
           So that's it?
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           I didn't say that. I just said
           there's no known way in -- because
           no one has ever tried to. But
           breaking out -- that's another
           story. It's not much easier, but
           it's possible.
                         
          The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF (CONT'D)
           You just need to find someone crazy
           enough to show you the way.
                         
                         
          INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
                         
          Tamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and
          the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder. Below lies
          a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           These catacombs run underneath the
           entire city, even to the cistern
           that drains out from the fortress
           dungeon.
                         
          Tamara's foot drops into knee high water. She immediately
          grabs her nose.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Catacombs? You mean sewers.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           Piss and shit are the last things
           you need to worry about down here.
           81.
                         
                         
          Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its
          murky surface.
                         
                         
          INT. OTHER SEWERS - NIGHT
                         
          The group wades through the water, single file. Conan notices
          HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb.
          Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.
                         
                          CONAN
           What is it?
                         
                          TAMARA
           A warning. These catacombs are
           connected to the sea. It says that
           the beasts of Acheron protect its
           secrets.
                         
                          CONAN
           Not from me.
                         
          Conan presses on, into the darkness.
                         
                         
          INT. CISTERN - NIGHT
                         
          The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its
          walls rising up high into the darkness. As the torches bring
          light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES.
                         
          As Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the
          other stop at the entrance.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've
           heard too much about what lies
           within to go any further.
                         
          Conan simply nods and the thieves depart. Conan raises his
          torch, illuminating the near wall.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Where now?
                         
                          CONAN
           Around. Up.
                         
          Conan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the
          other half. Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. She
          inhales deeply and takes her first step.
                         
                         CONAN
           82.
                         
                         
          Following the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but
          only one catches his eye. He stops before it.
                         
                         DEAD WARRIOR
                         
          Nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. But
          he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that
          resembles his father's own.
                         
          Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. It fits
          perfectly.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high
          sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Oh!!!
                         
          Tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water.
          Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           What?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Something touched me. Something
           slimy.
                         
          Conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on
          Tamara's leg. It's a SLUG, which he flicks off.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom! Stop wasting time.
                         
          But when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right
          before him. He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its
          submerges back into the water.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Crom indeed.
                         
          Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the
          water, wrapping around her waist. Tamara grabs hold of the
          wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater.
                         
          Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away.
          The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood
          everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with
          roiling intensity.
                         
          Conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into
          the far cistern wall.
           83.
                         
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Let's go.
                         
                         
          EXT. CIRCULAR STAIRWAY - CISTERN
                         
          As they work their way up the circular stairwell, towards a
          thin shaft of firelight up ahead.
                         
                         
          INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT
                         
          Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad
          corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors,
          leading to prison cells.
                         
          Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way
          to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on
          Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing.
                         
          The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in
          varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with
          entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her
          mouth.
                         
          Conan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear
          the sound of EERIE CHANTING.
                         
                          TAMARA
           What is that?
                         
          Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as
          the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to
          peer into the black void.
                         
                          CONAN
           Nothing good.
                         
          Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND
          blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A
          GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND.
                         
          In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Welcome.
                         
          A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the
          gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a
          vast CAGE built around a massive PIT.
           84.
                         
                         
          INT. THE PIT - NIGHT
                         
          The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only
          now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the
          void.
                         
          Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS,
          including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL
          out Tamara's name as they see her.
                         
          And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage,
          is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers.
                         
                          AKHUN
           Which ever one of you slaves gets
           me the girl, lives.
                         
          The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking
          a different plank way to get to them.
                         
                          CONAN
                          (TO TAMARA)
           Stay behind me.
                         
          Tamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to
          her.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Who dies first?
                         
          The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a
          short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first,
          Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending
          the wielder off balance and into the abyss.
                         
          The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better,
          as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single
          blow.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the
          top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage,
          her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo.
          Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have
          the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much
          like the one Conan cut through earlier.
                         
                         TENTACLED MONSTER
           85.
                         
                         
          Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a
          gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that
          feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth.
                         
          The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING
          combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in
          its gnashing maw.
                         
          The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the
          tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to
          check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there.
                         
          He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty
          feet directly above him.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Crom!
                         
                         AKHUN
                         
          The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the
          prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers.
                         
                          AKHUN
           Get her!
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the
          baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing
          towards her from either side.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her,
          evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety
          planks.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first
          Jailer reaches out to grab her. She reacts by GASHING his
          eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS
          THE PIT.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer
          SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to
          another.
                         
          Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian,
          forcing him to defend while still not balanced.
           86.
                         
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. He
          struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES
          HIS EAR OFF.
                         
          The Jailer drops Tamara, who SCREAMS as she falls.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him. In one swift move,
          he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing
          tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE
          FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold
          onto Tamara.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster
          below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and
          Conan aloft.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at
          the edge of the pit.
                         
          But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun
          entering the arena.
                         
                         AKHUN
                         
          The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan.
          He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to
          bend and warp.
                         
          Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his
          training in Cimmeria serves him well.
                         
          Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his
          legs. Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank
          close enough for him to jump to.
                         
                          AKHUN (CONT'D)
           You'll make a nice meal.
                         
          Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time
          Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.
                         
          Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him
          focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one
          great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.
           87.
                         
                         
          Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the
          abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. ARENA OF THE PIT - LATER
                         
          Conan lowers down the last of the baskets. Tamara use a sword
          to smash open the lock, freeing the prisoners inside.
                         
          Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock.
          The women look worn, but unbroken.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Where is Ilira?
                         
                          FEMALE MONK
           She was taken away by Fariq.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then I'm too late.
                         
          One of the stronger looking women, an ELDER MONK, steps
          forward.
                         
                          ELDER MONK
           No. She was just taken this
           morning. It's not yet midnight,
           and Khalar still must bring her to
           the cave of Acheron.
                         
          Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES. Conan
          shakes his head at the rag-tag group.
                         
                          CONAN
           You're going to fight Khalar's
           troops? Just you?
                         
          The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly
          about her body, clearly well versed in it use.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Cimmerians aren't the only women
           who know how to fight. And to kill.
                         
          Tamara looks at the other monks.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Our duty was to keep the queen
           safe. We failed. But if Khalar
           brings her to Acheron, it will rise
           again -- and all our peoples'
           sacrifice is for nothing.
                          (MORE)
           88.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           So if the queen is not free by the
           stroke of midnight -- she must be
           already dead.
                         
          The other monks nod and they start to head off. Tamara is the
          last to head off, her eyes burning into Conan's.
                         
                          CONAN
           You want my help again.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. You kept your word, I'll keep
           mine. I pray you fulfill your debt.
                         
          Tamara kisses Conan's cheek one last time and heads off.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
                         
          The monk travel in single file, the Elder Monk leading the
          way. Suddenly, she stops, motioning to an entranceway ahead.
                         
                          ELDER MONK
                          (WHISPERING)
           Guard.
                         
                          TAMARA
                          (WHISPERING)
           Don't kill him. We need to find out
           which way Ilira was taken.
                         
          The Elder Monk nods and slips up ahead. We hear a SMASH.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMB ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The stunned GUARD lies before the assembled monks. Tamara
          glares down at him.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Tell us where the last girl was
           taken.
                         
          The Guard just LAUGHS at them through bloody teeth.
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           Let me ask.
                         
          The Guard's face drops as Conan steps out from the darkness.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Your debt --
           89.
                         
                         
                          CONAN
           Will be where your queen is.
                         
          Tamara smiles. She knows it is a half truth.
                         
                         
          INT. FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          As Conan and the monks enter, the throne room is empty,
          scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber.
                         
          Ilira sits on the throne, crown on her slumped head. Tamara
          runs over to her.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Ilira!
                         
          She raises Ilira's head, only to discover lifeless eyes.
          Tamara cradles her best friend's face.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           She's dead. It's over.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Not yet.
                         
          Before the monks can react, ARROWS STREAK OUT FROM THE
          DARKNESS, killing them all. Only Conan is quick enough to
          dodge his arrow by diving aside.
                         
          When he comes up, Khalar has Tamara, his sword at her neck.
          Several ARCHERS stand behind him, at the ready.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           It's only begun. Because that one
           was not the heir to Acheron.
                         
          Khalar smiles down at Tamara.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           She is.
                         
          Slowly, what he's saying dawns on her.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No. It can't be --
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Secretive, the traitors of Acheron.
           It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally
           wrung honesty from the girl. That
           poor innocent was forced to live a
           lie, even as the truth was kept
           from the queen herself.

           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
                          (TO CONAN)
           And you did the rest, barbarian. My
           thanks for delivering the Queen to
           me.
                         
                          TAMARA
           No!
                         
          Suddenly, a trap door opens beneath Conan and drops down in
          the darkness, landing with a heavy THUD.
                         
                         
          INT. FORGE - NIGHT
                         
          Conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade SIZZLING
          as it hits the cooling vat.
                         
          But this is no dream of his father's forge -- as he looks up
          to see Fariq holding a sword, its tip still red hot, the
          flames of the fortress's forge behind him.
                         
          Conan's thrusts forward, only to find his armed chained
          around a heavy mortar and stone pillar.
                         
          Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.
                         
                          FARIQ
           At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's
           been hours you've made me wait for
           my fun.
                         
          Conan says nothing, but his eyes scan the room, taking in
          everything.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           You made me lose face in front of
           my father. That wasn't wise. But
           what should I expect from a
           Cimmerian?
                         
                          CONAN
           A swift end!
                         
          Conan strains at the chain, ripping the skin beneath his
          shackles -- but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the
          pillar.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Hardly. But that is a difference
           between you and me. A swift end
           would be a mercy I do not intend to
           grant. No, you must suffer for your
           transgressions.

           91.
                         
                          FARIQ (CONT'D)
           You must beg for your suffering to
           end. Just as your people did.
                         
          He waves the glowing sword tip in front of Conan's face.
                         
                          CONAN
           You lie. I was there. My father
           never uttered a sound.
                         
          Fariq LAUGHS, amused.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You were there? What were you
           doing, warrior? Watching your
           father die, without saying a sound?
           Taking your eyes will be justice
           indeed, coward.
                         
          Fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against Conan's skin.
          Conan's face reddens with pain, but he doesn't utter a sound.
          But as Conan pulls on his chains -- more mortar falls. As
          Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, Conan
          notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is
          LOOSE.
                         
                          CONAN
           I saw my father die. Slain by one
           who can only kill men already on
           their knees.
                         
          Fariq turns, his eyes blazing. He glances over at the two
          GUARDS by the door, who try not to listen.
                         
                          FARIQ
           I've killed many in battle, cur.
                         
                          CONAN
           Really? Then why did your father
           not let you face me before, when I
           had sword in hand. He thought you
           unequal to the task.
                         
          Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conan's
          chest. Conan just YELLS back at him.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Coward! Prove your strength!
                         
          Again, Fariq pushes the hot blade against Conan's skin.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.
           92.
                         
                         
          Fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at Conan's head.
          Conan lifts his manacles, forcing the blade up into the brick
          holding his chain.
                         
          Then Conan pulls on the chains with all his might, loosening
          the heavy brick, which falls to the ground.
                         
          In one powerful movement, Conan begins SWINGING the chain
          with the mortar block on the end, a homemade ball and chain.
                         
          The two Guards come forward, sword drawn, only to meet with a
          CRUNCHING blow by Conan's weapon. Both their heads get caved
          in.
                         
          Fariq rushes Conan, getting in too close for Conan's wide
          swings. Conan simply meets Fariq's sword with the heavy
          chains, then encircles Fariq's neck with the steel bonds.
                         
          Fariq CHOKES, falling to the ground, gasping for air. But
          Conan doesn't kill him -- yet.
                         
                         THE FORGE
                         
          A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge.
          Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.
                         
                         FARIQ
                         
          Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of
          Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward
          his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS.
                         
          Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword. THE SWORD
          CONAN'S FATHER MADE FOR HIM.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA PENINSULA - NIGHT
                         
          By torchlight, Khalar Singh leads his black-armored PERSONAL
          GUARD, two dozen men strong, across a rocky peninsula,
          jutting out into the sea. On the back of Khalar's horse,
          bound, rides the helpless Tamara.
                         
          As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe
          inspiring sight. A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock
          formation, rises over the peninsula.
                         
          As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the
          mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty
          feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone. It has the
          appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.
           93.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous
          doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of
          the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces
          of demonic warrior statues.
                         
          At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too
          numerous to count.
                         
                          TAMARA
           This is no empire, only a
           graveyard.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You see only with your eyes.
                         
          Khalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and
          light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain
          reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing
          the true scope of this place.
                         
          An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns
          that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.
                         
          And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised
          THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty.
                         
          Khalar turns to his guards.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Close the gates and stay here. Send
           my son to me when he arrives.
           (motioning to two of them)
           You two, come with me.
                         
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of
          purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for
          the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles
          of bone.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           The Acheronians had a wonderful
           sense of balance, don't you think?
           For one to ascend to royalty,
           another must fall.
                         
          With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.
           94.
                         
                         
          Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar
          absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the
          altar, his two guards shackling her in place.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           For a hundred generations the kings
           of Acheron were crowned, and the
           queens were sacrificed.
                         
          Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately
          carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a
          Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of
          skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.
                         
          And from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A
          CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately
          detailed gold that glows in the firelight.
                         
          But the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend
          from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than
          a crown.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           What a day for you. This morning
           you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you
           are a queen giving birth to an
           empire.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Bloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock. He has
          nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP
          SACK tied to his hip.
                         
          He stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a
          grave toll. Still he stands and presses on.
                         
          He pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He
          puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining
          to their utmost. Again -- no movement.
                         
          Conan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs
          up the side of the rock.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          Khalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian. Ancient, harsh words, as
          he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the
          statues of dark gods all around.
           95.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop. You don't know what you are
           about to do.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           But I do. For thirty years I have
           dreamed of this day. The day our
           people rise from the ashes.
                         
          Khalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown
          upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon
          reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an
          unnatural glow.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout
          the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds
          like the heartbeat of a giant.
                         
          Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She
          thrashes and struggles but to no avail.
                         
          Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes
          around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE
          THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony.
                         
          Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels
          around the edges of the altar.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           It begins. You give birth to an
           empire.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE SIDE OF THE SKULL - NIGHT
                         
          Conan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on
          by one hand -- and climbing again.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth
          does. Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom.
                         
          He reaches the eye of the skull.
                         
                         REVERSE ANGLE
                         
          With the moon over his shoulder, Conan stares down at the
          unholy sight before him. We pull back revealing Tamara, her
          blood draining from her body.
           96.
                         
                         
          INT. ACHERON CAVE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in
          pained whispers.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           It's good that you pray. Gods will
           be here soon.
                         
          Tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.
                         
                          TAMARA
           He'll--be---here--sooner.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Who?
                         
           CONAN (O.S.)
           Me!
                         
          Khalar turns to see the outline of Conan, framed by the
          moonlight, looking down at Khalar from atop of one the
          warrior statues. A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route
          down from the cave roof above.
                         
          Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before
          the altar. It is a killing floor.
                         
          The two Guardsmen leap for him, but Conan dispatches them
          with a pair of strikes. Both fall down dead.
                         
          Conan meets Tamara's eyes, a look of determination,
          assurance. He starts toward the altar.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I will say this for you, barbarian.
           You are hard to kill.
                         
                          CONAN
           Let her go.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You've faced me before and lost.
           What do you think has changed now?
                         
                          CONAN
           My purpose.
                         
          Conan lunges for Khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of
          sparks. They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP,
          THUMP.
                         
                         THE ALTAR
           97.
                         
                         
          Tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her
          head. More blood pours forth. The blood in the channels
          speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the
          sacrificial pool.
                         
          Conan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar
          nimbly blocks his path.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You are strong, Cimmerian, but we
           both know you are not my equal.
                         
          Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.
                         
                          CONAN
           Once you used my father to teach
           your son a lesson about strength.
           Now let me teach you.
                         
          Conan tosses out what is inside. It falls to the ground,
          rolling to Khalar Singh's feet.
                         
                         FARIQ'S HEAD
                         
          Khalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his beloved
          son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. Khalar trembles
          in shock and rage.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           No.
                         
          Khalar reaches for the severed head, giving Conan a brief
          window to rush to Tamara's side. Conan tries to lift her off
          the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Cimmerian!!!
                         
          Enraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and
          force into an all-out attack. Conan simply sidesteps it, then
          shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists.
          Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again.
                         
          Khalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just
          inches from his face. Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking
          the warlord back ten feet. Khalar's attack is feral,
          uncontrolled. He's lost his balance.
                         
          Spinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second
          shackle on her wrist. He continues his motion, bringing his
          sword around to meet Khalar's next strike.
           98.
                         
                         
          Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more
          polished warrior. Their battle takes them away from the
          altar.
                         
          With her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out
          and remove the crown.
                         
          THE KILLING FLOOR
                         
          Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking
          Khalar's chest and drawing blood. The Guardsmen arrive from
          the other side of the cave, drawing their swords.
                         
          Khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           The Queen. Shackle her!
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          In agony, Tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another.
          She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off
          her bloodied head --
                         
          When the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the
          crown back on.
                         
          THUMP, THUMP! The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper
          as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the
          altar.
                         
          WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in
          a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around
          the altar until reaching the channel's end --
                         
          THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL
          POOL. It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially,
          bubbling forth and filling the entire pool.
                         
          AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. A massive earthquake jolts the
          entire cave.
                         
          THE KILLING FLOOR
                         
          As Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on
          the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP! The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor
          of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.
          Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can
          reach to prevent them from falling further.
           99.
                         
                         
          Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the
          cave. Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred
          pool.
                         
          Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. They look
          below, searching for the source of the glow.
                         
                         ACHERON
                         
          Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of
          ancient Acheron. The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest
          taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.
                         
          And as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows
          there MOVE.
                         
          Is it a trick of the light? No. Whatever the dark forms are,
          they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires
          and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar
          Singh.
                         
          Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Beyond my dreams --
                         
                         THE ALTAR
                         
          Tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to
          the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised
          to fall into the fiery depths.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan!!!
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales
          the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly,
          trying to get to Tamara.
                         
                         KHALAR SINGH
                         
          Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures
          rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects,
          clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying
          mantis.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human,
          part demon. Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of
          black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red
          eyes and gnashing teeth.
           100.
                         
                         
          They advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that
          Conan climbs upward towards Tamara.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron.
           I command you to kneel!
                         
          And this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor
          sharp teeth bared. Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight.
          The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel. They
          climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads
          before Khalar Singh.
                         
          Out of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing
          near.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           Show him the might of the army of
           Acheron!
                         
          But they do not rush to follow the order. They stir. One of
          them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at
          Khalar's Guardsmen.
                         
                          ACHERONIAN COMMANDER
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           First, we feed.
                         
          Its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fine. Take your fill. I will kill
           him myself.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across
          chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave
          of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining
          Guardsmen.
                         
                         KHALAR'S GUARDSMEN
                         
          Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with
          mouths agape, realize the danger too late. The horde of
          Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues
          between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.
                         
                         CONAN
                         
          His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling
          the cliffs of Cimmeria.
           101.
                         
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the
          ready.
                         
                          CONAN
           Your story ends here.
                         
          The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to
          the statues.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip
          their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the
          blood of their victims. It is a violent ritual, both
          Bacchantic and gruesome.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone
          statuary. Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.
          Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely
          misses his throat.
                         
          Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. Conan's eyes
          narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Like a woman, Fariq cried and
           begged me to spare him.
                         
          Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive. Conan
          backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.
                         
          And it comes quickly. Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS
          Khalar across the stomach. Khalar loses his balance and
          falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling
          over the abyss.
                         
          Conan raises his sword to finish the job.
                         
           TAMARA (O.S.)
           Conan!!!
                         
          Conan glances down. The Acheronian Commander drank his fill,
          and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's
          body. With one touch, the shackles open. He and the
          Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.
                         
          Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.
           102.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           They take her to a place you can
           never follow. Who will you fail,
           Cimmerian? Your father or your
           woman?
                         
          Conan leaps down to the altar. The Acheronian Warriors
          attack. Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers,
          cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Tamara!!
                         
          They leap on Conan, impossibly fast. They stab him. They cut
          him. But he does not stop. Even wounded, he throws them into
          the abyss.
                         
          And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her
          below. He grabs her arm. The Commander grabs her other arm,
          baring his shark-like teeth.
                         
          BLAM! Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and
          the Commander falls into the abyss.
                         
          The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms. Only for
          Tamara to scream.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Conan!
                         
          Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes. Khalar's tulwar
          narrowly misses, and Conan counters. His father's sword runs
          Khalar Singh through.
                         
          Khalar's body falls into the abyss.
                         
          But the Acheronian Warriors surround them. Thousands climb
          out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded
          Conan. Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.
                         
                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Conan, you know what you must do.
           Kill me.
                         
                          CONAN
           No.
                         
                          TAMARA
           It is the only way to end this. My
           death gives others life.
                         
                          CONAN
           I cannot.
           103.
                         
                         
                          TAMARA
           You must. Your parents both
           understood that purpose. Now it is
           yours. Live, Conan.
                         
          A tear falls from Tamara's face. The demonic warriors prepare
          to strike.
                         
          Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart. The crown spikes
          retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.
                         
          BOOM! A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly
          GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into
          the abyss.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN CAVE
                         
          The cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof
          dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.
                         
                         ALTAR
                         
          Conan pulls Tamara's body away, even as the world descends
          into dust and debris.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Khalar's HORSE stands near the entrance. Conan puts Tamara's
          body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. He
          positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her.
                         
          Conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood
          staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGH PLATEAU - DAWN
                         
          A blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains.
          Conan holds a single torch in his hand. His look is hard.
          Grim.
                         
          We pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, Tamara's body atop it.
          Conan places the torch to the pyre. It quickly spreads.
                         
          We move in, closer and closer upon Conan's ice blue eyes, a
          blazing fire erupting in them. A fire that will never be
          extinguished.
                         
           TAMARA (O.S.)
           Live, Conan. Live.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.

                             EARLY PRODUCTION DRAFT

                             November 14, 2002




FADE IN:





EXT. ISTANBUL - DUSK

Glimpses of an ancient city.   Almost motionless against
the tide of time.
Sea swelled along an endless wall. Billowing silk frozen
against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine columns.
FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees.




INT. PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE

Corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite
darkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like
atomized ether.
There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES.
DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief
flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --




FINAL CELL

A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a
wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying.
He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he
scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year,
the spoon finally breaks through.




INT. NARROW CHANNEL

Prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a
dead end against a thick wooden door. He nudges a
shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS
open, sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER.




INT. PRISONER'S CELL

The tapestry covering the HOLE is pulled against the
wall, then billows outward like a sail.




INT. CHAMBER - PRISONER

pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. He scans
the musty room. Antique furniture. A few empty crates.
And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       2.





CONTINUED:

He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above
through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to
reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed
corner and slides it under the light.
He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole
and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives
way and his foot crunches through.
Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees
something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it
out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a
Nazi flag.
At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches
long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of
some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead.
As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.




MYSTERIOUS POV

From BEHIND. As if he's being watched by someone else.
Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing.




PRISONER

starts toward the way out.




INT. PRISONER CORRIDOR

The Guard's flashlight beam probes the cell -- one by one
-- falls on the tapestry. Christ billows out from the
wall, revealing the hole.




INT. PRISON - VARIOUS SHOTS

ALARMS SOUND.    Lights BLAST ON.   Guards with weapons rush
through.




INT. NARROW CHANNEL

Prisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight.




EXT. PRISON - NIGHT

SIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS sweep across the ominous
structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for
the trees on the other side of the wall.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         3.





CONTINUED:


                            GUARDS

                      (in Turkish)
             Stop!   Stop!
Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. GUNSHOTS RING
OUT. Bullets streak toward him but never hit their
target. Guards check their weapons on the run.




EXT. NEAR A ROAD - NIGHT

Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road.
Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner
spins, is right in the path of a car.
BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS
Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap.
CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front
end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires.
He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is
stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured.
Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in
his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL
has appeared as if embossed in the flesh.
Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off.
OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM.




INT. APARTMENT - DAY

FATHER HENNESSEY (50), stands over a young teen (13),
JEANIE, splashes holy water on her body. She screams
again.

                           HENNESSEY

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes!
Her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her
hands and feet to the bed frame. Notice her fingernails.
Drained of color. Almost black.
Her MOTHER is off to one side, completely hysterical.
On the other side is a crowd of bewildered TENANTS, all
crammed into the hallway outside the opened door.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     4.





CONTINUED:

Nothing can compare with an exorcism.   Especially one
that's gone bad.
The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his
heart. It's obvious he's totally out of his league here.
GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER --




EXT. AGING APARTMENT BUILDING

Not in a third world country but smack center in one of
America's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in
the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest
fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt
liquor.

SUPERIMPOSE:   LOS ANGELES - TODAY





EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT

A faded yellow taxi PULLS UP and stops. Someone steps
out, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt.




INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - FOYER

Doors open, flood the musty darkness with a brief relief
of sunlight. A MAN -- whose face we don't see -- steps
inside, his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of
a raven.
He pauses, pulls an ORNATE LIGHTER and lights a
cigarette. Takes a puff and pushes on inside.




INT. NARROW STAIRCASE HALL WALL

Lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the
unexplainable.
The Stranger pushes through. Suspicious faces step out
of his path. The ones that don't he pushes aside -- even
the gangbangers.
The man has no patience for politeness, no time for tact,
no fear of anything.
This man is JOHN CONSTANTINE.
He arrives at his destination, barges into --




                                                      5.





INT. APARTMENT 7B

One scan of the situation is all it takes. The bed --
the child -- the panicked priest -- who rushes to John.

                        HENNESSEY

                  (whispering)
          Thank God you're here...
John shoots him a disgusted look.    Hennessey gives him a
wide berth.
John walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a
glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing
tip drooped over the edge. He puts a gloved hand to the
child's face and it burns on contact. His demeanor
instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of
the little girl and whispers --

                        JOHN

          This is Constantine. John
          Constantine, asshole.
The girl JOLTS, bandages on her arms cut into her skin.
Eyes snap open -- glare right through him.

                          JOHN

          How ya doing?

                        JEANIE

          Vamos juntos a matarla.
John whips out a key chain crammed with medallions.

                        JOHN

          Let's see who we got here...
He holds them up so they cast shadows across Jeanie's
face. He flips through each of these sculptured SAINTS
until the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look
away.
John stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely
puzzled. He turns to the Mother -- very serious.

                        JOHN

          I need a mirror. Now.
Shaken, the Mother produces a small compact.   John pushes
it away, turns to the doorway crowd.

                        JOHN

          A large mirror. At least --
                  (sizes up the child)
          -- three feet high.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                        6.





CONTINUED:

The hallway crowd discusses possibilities.

                             JOHN


             MOVE.

Tenants run to retrieve a mirror.     Hennessey looks
worried.
John grabs the bed -- shoves Hennessey aside as he swings
the bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way. Faces
it toward the window.




INTERCUT - APARTMENT 5G BELOW

Several of the MEN from the hallway crowd storm through
an OLD WOMAN'S stuffy apartment, locate a huge iron-
framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the
wall.




JOHN

centers on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard. Drapery HOOKS
EXPLODE off the curtain rod as he swings open the window,
looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is
parked.

                             JOHN

             Chaz?
CHAZ (20s) looks up from his cab. Cool. Frustrated.
You just know he'd love to be up there, not down here.

                             JOHN

             Move the car.

                             CHAZ

             Why?

                           JOHN


             MOVE THE DAMN CAR.

John frees the drapery rope, ducks back into the room.

                           CHAZ

             Park the car -- Move the car...
Chaz shifts into reverse, moves the car three feet.

                           CHAZ

             There, I moved the damn car.




                                                      7.





INT. HALLWAY

Four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror. The
Old Woman follows, begs them to be gentle. They swing
the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. She
freaks.




INT. APARTMENT 7B

Hennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope
through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through
the window and loops it over the ceiling fan.
He climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes
have closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to
be going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this.
John has no choice -- slaps her. Eyes pop back open.
Dark and dilated. He yells down at her in Aramaic and
English.

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --
The girl chokes as if ready to spit.

                        JOHN

          That's it -- time to go home.
Jeanie SCREAMS --

                        JEANIE

          Tiempo para morir!
Her body suddenly PULSES half again larger. John recoils
for a beat. Odd. He continues in Aramaic --

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar --
Another PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen
expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon
inside were trying to burst right through.
John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh,
like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances
to Hennessey. What the hell?
MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM.
John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room.

                         JOHN

          Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                           8.





CONTINUED:

John ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over
him.

                           JOHN

             Hennessey, tie it off --
Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly
ties one end of rope to the mirror. John straddles the
girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above
him.

                           JOHN

             Now close your eyes -- all of you
             -- and whatever happens -- do not
             look into the mirror.
The men close their eyes.        Muscles tense under the
weight.

                           JOHN

             Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind
             from the flesh I command thee!
Jeanie reacts -- that SHAPE reappears, contorts the young
body all out of proportion.
John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is
reflected inside. It's not just the image of a young
girl in there, but something else. The surface of the
mirror FLEXES in the hands of the men. One starts to
look --

                             JOHN

             No!
Jeanie SCREAMS -- breaks free of the straps. She rises
up, grabs John tight around the throat. Nails dig deep.

                             HENNESSEY

             John?!

                              JOHN

                        (looking into
                         mirror)
             Not yet!
John struggles, puts his hands over her mouth -- cutting
off her air supply. Question is, who's going to pass out
first?
Jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. She
goes into shock, body collapsing -- shaking -- close to
death.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                       9.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             Look!   Look at me!
But she's passing out first. John quickly takes the
medallion that caused the earlier reaction --

                           JOHN

             Goddamit -- look!
-- and presses it against her forehead. Eyes snap wide
and John unblocks the mirror. Jeanie locks on her
reflection and the image in the mirror changes
drastically.

                           JOHN

             Smile pretty you vain prick.
The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off
DEMON. One that knows it just got suckered in.
MIRROR VIBRATES wildly in the men's grip. Demon
reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into
three-D space as the girl takes her last breaths --

                           JOHN

             Now, Hennessey. Now!
Hennessey PULLS the rope with all three-hundred-plus
pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended

FINGER.


                             JOHN

             For your boss.
Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion.
Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of
wood --

                             JOHN

             No you don't.
John jumps up and helps push the mirror free.




EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HUGE MIRROR

Falls SLOW MOTION from the 7th story -- tumbling end over
end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, PROJECTING
the image of the Demon into the LA cityscape. ONTO
buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three
hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON
the taxi's hood.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                       10.





CONTINUED:


                           CHAZ


             SHIT!

Demon's image SHATTERS on impact -- GLASS SPLINTERING
into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air.
The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city
beyond.
Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet.




INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jeanie GASPS -- takes her first breath as a child again.
And CRIES. Mother pulls her in, hugs her tight. Note
the girl's fingernails. No longer black.
John's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still
burning. Takes a drag. He pushes past Hennessey who is
approaching the mother.

                           HENNESSEY

             Now about the fee...
John slips FROM VIEW into the kitchenette, hides the fact
that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance.
He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a
child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. A drawing
of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick.
This image is repeated over and over.
John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away.




INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - LATER

Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing
the gathered tenants. A few are freaked, cross
themselves. Others horrified. But many want to touch
them, shake their hands.
A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail
at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the polished
veneer.
This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here.
He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers.
JOHN pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing
something. No one there. Balthazar is gone.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         11.





CONTINUED:

JOHN shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps
where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the
tenants. They're gladly giving to the cause.

                              HENNESSEY

             Thank you.     Yes... Gracias...

                             JOHN

             Hennessey.
Hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the
exit.




INT. FOYER

John and Hennessey stop near the front entrance.      John
rips the white collar from Hennessey's neck.

                           HENNESSEY

             I know, I know, but I didn't think
             she was really possessed, not like
             that.

                           JOHN

             I'm not back an hour and you drag
             me into --

                           HENNESSEY

             -- Don't be mad, John, don't be --
John rummages through his coat pockets --

                           HENNESSEY

             On the left side.
John keeps searching.

                             HENNESSEY

             Vest pocket.
John rips his smokes from the left vest pocket --

                           JOHN

             Don't do that shit on me --

                             HENNESSEY

             Sorry, sorry.    Here, you can have
             half.
Hennessey starts to divvy the cash but John snatches the
hat.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        12.





CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             I should take it all, save you
             from yourself.
He gestures that bagged BOTTLE in Hennessey's jacket.

                           HENNESSEY

             It keeps them out, so I can sleep.
             Please, John, I need to sleep.
John stares at his pathetic friend, sighs, finally slips
a few bills from the wad and hands them over.
Hennessey is bubbling with appreciation, starts to
follow. John simply holds up a hand. Hennessey stops,
watches John walk out. Alone.




EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT

John turns the corner, spots Chaz punching a dent from
the taxi's hood.

                           JOHN

             I told you to move it.

                           CHAZ

             Well maybe if you had told me you
             were dropping a three-hundred
             pound mirror with a pissed-off
             demon in it I would have moved it
             further.
Chaz slams the hood.      They slide into the car.

                           CHAZ

             Well?

                           JOHN

             Well what?
Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls
out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills.

                           CHAZ

             Shouldn't have cut your stay in
             the land of enlightenment. You
             were so close to growing a
             conscience.
John grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and
sits back.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                        13.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Los Angeles...
He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled.

                           JOHN

             Never ceases to entertain.
Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs.




EXT. THE SKY

One of those perfect days. With perfect clouds. So
clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven.
Two young girls rise INTO FRAME on side-by-side swings.
For a moment they're suspended against that incredible
sky. Then gravity takes hold and they fall back to
Earth.

                           MAN (V.O.)

             You still with me?




INT. SUBWAY - DAY

ANGELA'S (30) weary eyes open. She's on her belly hidden
between track ties and shadows even deeper. Grips a
police-issue revolver tight. She's pinned down, unable
to move.

                           ANGELA

             Yeah...
The MAN is thirty feet down the same track. Their VOICES
ECHO off the curved walls, come from everywhere.
How either of these two got here isn't important.      Who
will get out is.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             So what's next, Detective?   We
             gonna do a full marathon?
Intermittent RADIO CHATTER buzzes from Angela's WALKIE-
TALKIE. You get the sense Angela is not alone in here.

                           ANGELA

             Put your weapon on the tracks and
             step out with your hands above
             your head.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                           MAN (O.S.)

             Or how 'bout you show yourself and
             I put a bullet in your skull just
             like I did hers!

                           ANGELA

             That's just not going to happen.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             You sure about that?!
Angela checks the chamber -- sees she has one bullet
left.

                           ANGELA

                     (almost pleading)
             Now put down your weapon on the
             tracks and --
GROUND BEGINS to VIBRATE.     Tunnel starts to GLOW.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             Well ain't this a peach?!
Angela looks back, sees several SHADOWS of figures waving
far off. Her RADIO is flooded with futzed CHATTER.

                           DETECTIVE WEISS (V.O.)

                     (over radio)
             Get off the tracks! Blueline is
             coming! Clear the tracks!
Angela peeks over the track.     Still no sign of her perp.
The TRAIN is coming INTO VIEW and its BEAM shoots through
the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova.
The SOUND is DEAFENING.

                           MAN (O.S.)

             C'mon, Detective, step into the
             light and be saved!!
Angela looks back, squints into the brilliant LIGHT.
She grips her GUN and in one burst of flat-out bravado --
rises as she AIMS.
And there he is -- the Man rising with his own gun.
Angela FIRES as both dive off the track. His BULLET
RICOCHETS behind her. Hers finds its mark. Man goes
down right in the train's path.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       15.

Angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her
breath. She closes her eyes and crosses herself as the
train roars past in a staccato blur.




EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Chaz's taxi pulls up, parks.




TAXI TRUNK

OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA.   John
starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells --

                           CHAZ

             There are four bags. I have two
             hands. This give you any ideas?

                           JOHN

             Make two trips?
John walks in.     Chaz curses under his breath.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Evening leagues are going strong. John walks in, looks
totally out of place. He moves down the BALL RACK area,
runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally
stops at a pearl-white dazzler.
He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep
area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use.
Number 13.
John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead,
scribbles right on the ball -- "PROVISIONS DEPLETED."
He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished
wood with his well-traveled Oxfords.
Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity.
An attractive brunette is rather curious. John gives her
a wink. Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it.
John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins.
John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the
pool tables.




                                                      16.





INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT

Seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as
a bowling lane. Makes that cage enclosed bed at one end
seem like it's a mile away.
Chaz throws the suitcases on it as John arrives.

                        CHAZ

                  (yells across room)
          Simple question. How much longer
          do I have to be your slave?
John pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open.

                        JOHN

          You're not my slave, Chaz. You're
          my very appreciated assistant.
          Like Tonto and Robin and that
          skinny fellow with the fat friend.
Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon
Sparkletts bottles. Each is adorned by a small hand-
marked CROSS. John takes a moment to adjust one out of
place.

                        CHAZ

          How much longer?
John doesn't like his tone.

                        JOHN

          Well I don't know, what's the
          going rate for saving a taxi
          driver hanging from his
          fingernails about to be swallowed
          into the jaws of Hell?

                        CHAZ

          So what time you want me back?
John gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his
pockets.

                        JOHN

          I need to make an appearance at
          Midnite's. Say ten-ish?
Chaz sighs, starts out --

                        JOHN

          Chaz...?
Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         17.

                           JOHN

             A little something from Delphi.
It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow.
Chaz tips it.     Moooooo.   John finds it rather amusing.

                             CHAZ

             Gee, thanks.
Chaz leaves. John removes a small BLACK BOX from his
jacket. He sets it carefully on its own shelf by the
window -- stares out.

                           BEEMAN (O.S.)

             'Provisions depleted?'
John turns to see BEEMAN waddle in.

                           BEEMAN

             I gave you three months worth.
             You were gone only one.
This diminutive occult version of Bond's "Q" carries a
custom bowling bag and squints in the light like a mole.

                           JOHN

             What can I say, Beeman, India was
             a real drain.
They shake hands.     Beeman sets his bowling bag onto the
table, unzips it.

                           BEEMAN

             So what do you need?

                           JOHN

             Everything you got.

                           BEEMAN

                     (pausing)
             You smell something, John?

                           JOHN

             Maybe. Incubus in this girl I
             just exorcized seemed a bit more
             spirited than usual.
Beeman starts pulling things out.      First is a frayed RAG.
Then glass containers...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         18.





CONTINUED:


                           BEEMAN

             Well, I've got your stone
             fragments from the Road to
             Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea
             Scrolls -- oh, you'll love this --
Out comes a little MATCHBOX with a smiling bug graphic.

                           BEEMAN

             Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.
He shakes the matchbox and the BEETLE flutters inside.
It's WINGS create an eerie HIGH-PITCHED WHIRL. John
shrugs. So?

                           BEEMAN

             Yeah, to you it's nothing but to
             the Fallen -- like fingernails on
             a chalkboard.

                           JOHN

             What is it with you and bugs?
Beeman pulls out a set of sculptured BRASS KNUCKLES.
Actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings.
John takes them, tries them on. Nice fit.

                           BEEMAN

             Gold was blessed by the Bishop
             Anicott during the Crusades.
John spots a foot-long COPPER TUBE in the bag, pulls it
out, grips the bicycle handle on one end.

                           BEEMAN

             Watch it there.
With this puny little thing? John gives the handle a
squeeze and WHOOOOSH -- ten-foot FLAME BELCHES out.

                           BEEMAN

             Dragon's breath.

                           JOHN

             I thought you couldn't get it
             anymore.
Beeman shrugs, modesty. John starts to put it down on
the table and Beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away.

                           BEEMAN

             Whoa, don't want to get a flame
             near this.
                     (off John's look)
             Piece of the shroud Moses wore to
             the mountain.
John picks it up -- You're shitting me, right?    Nope.

                           JOHN

             Got any callinicus?

                           BEEMAN

                     (intrigued)
             How spirited was this incubus?

                           JOHN

                     (coughs)
             Like it was trying to come right
             out through the girl
Beeman just stares at him -- is this a joke?

                           JOHN

             I know how it sounds...

                           BEEMAN

             We're finger puppets to them,
             John, elaborate costumes -- they
             can work us but don't come through
             us. They can't. You know that.

                           JOHN

             Check the scrolls anyway.
             Corinthians. See if there are any
             precedents.

                            BEEMAN

             Sure, John.   Anything else?

                           JOHN

                     (coughs again)
             Wouldn't happen to have anything
             for --
Beeman sets down a bottle from the bag -- Vick's 44.

                             BEEMAN

             On the house.




EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Lots of blue on blue in this parking lot.




                                                          20.





INT. LOCKER ROOM

Locker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the
grime of the subway. She's pained as she pulls off her
shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror.
Tired, aging eyes stare back.

                        WEISS (O.S.)

          Gutsy move out there, Dodson.
Angela glances at DETECTIVE WEISS as he opens his locker.

                          ANGELA

          Gutsy?    Well that's a new one.
The two exchange a look.

                        WEISS

          You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No
          point in using the other words.

                          ANGELA

          Thanks.

                        WEISS

                  (shuts his locker)
          Even though it was reckless --
          irresponsible -- stupid...

                        ANGELA

          I knew you still cared.

                        WEISS

          You're good, Angela, real good but
          one of these days...

                         ANGELA

                   (heard it before)
          I know, nobody's luck lasts
          forever.
He meets her eyes.    Exactly.     He really does care.
Weiss breaks it off, leaves. Angela turns to close her
locker door, notices her reflection does not turn.
She grabs the door, looks back in. Reflection is as it
should be. She shudders, slams the locker door.




EXT. CLUB MIDNITE - 10 PM

So exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a
pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     21.





CONTINUED:

Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A
Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front
are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which
is --

                           JOHN

             Two frogs on a bench.
Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him --
he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS.

                           CHAZ

             Two frogs on a bench.
But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card
shows a BEAR in a dress.

                            CHAZ

             What?   But I'm with him!   Right,
             John?   John?
John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz
backs away, stares after him. Someday.




INT. CLUB MIDNITE

MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash
of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro
speakeasy for the new millennium.
John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies
of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses,
sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing
off for several ladies.
One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water.
Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into
RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up.
NICO, a young black man, walks past John.

                           NICO

             Neighborhood's going to Hell.
John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on.
One of the men in the group turns, watches John.
Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN.




INT. HALLWAY

John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of
two very large doors.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         22.





CONTINUED:

Their surface is ancient, the wood petrified over
countless centuries. John places his fingers into the
gnarled folds, closes his eyes --

                           JOHN

             Numquam leadatur a morsu.
A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors
don't budge.

                           JOHN

             Bastard changed the code again.
                     (bangs the doors)
             Midnite! Come on, do I have to
             huff and puff here?!
The doors unlatch.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE

SWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific
sculpture that normally displays our solar system in
relative motion. But the planets here are ancient RELICS
with symbols and names -- MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL,
ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center -- "CREATOR."
This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And
it's not moving.

                           MIDNITE (O.S.)

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes...
John steps in through the doors behind.

                           JOHN

             Deciding which color to paint this
             place again?
PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office.
Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A
full six and half feet of solid contradictions.

                           MIDNITE

             You're back early.

                           JOHN

             I got tired of spending your
             money.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         23.





CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             But I'm sure you spent enough.

                           JOHN

             Well I do have a certain standard
             of living.

                           MIDNITE

             Tell me you found it.

                           JOHN

             I found the vault.

                           MIDNITE

             That's not what I asked.

                           JOHN

             Hey, can I help it if Buddhist
             monks don't take bribes?
Midnite strides toward him when John calmly pulls from
his pocket a small ebony and gold RELIC. It stops
Midnite cold.

                             JOHN

             Gotcha.
A reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features. He
takes the relic in his thick fingers -- stares
breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a
cosmic wind.

                           MIDNITE

             Second century depiction of a
             sephiroth in the 4th realm...

                             JOHN

             Right.    So we good here?
Midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic
precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the
Universal orrery.

                           MIDNITE

             It should counter the iconic
             plane --

                           JOHN

             That damn thing's never going to
             balance.
Midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts
to move. To turn.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          24.





CONTINUED:

John is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic
collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt.
Midnite deflates, stares at John, suspiciously.

                           MIDNITE

             Must I remind you of what selling
             fake relics will do to your
             health?

                           JOHN

             It's authentic, Midnite, you just
             have the wrong piece. Jesus...
The two have a mini stare-down. John's rigid poker face
is only broken by a cough. Midnite sighs, breaks it off.

                           JOHN

             What? -- I didn't blink -- that
             was a cough. You never cough?
Midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a
thick stack of HUNDREDS.

                           JOHN

             Better not be any Washingtons in
             here this time.

                           MIDNITE

             Why did you cut your trip short?
John stops the counting, actually thinks about it.

                           JOHN

             I don't know... Just a feeling --
John suddenly spins toward the entrance doors, is stunned
to see --

                           JOHN

             Balthazar.
Balthazar is behind him.     Utterly confident.     Chillingly
so.

                           BALTHAZAR

             We're not still whining about
             Manhattan, are we?
John's attempt to disguise his anger fails.

                           BALTHAZAR

             That expression alone has made my
             entire night.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                          25.





CONTINUED:

John takes several steps toward him.       Grins.   Malevolent.
There's history here.

                           JOHN

             I'll make your night -- I'll
             deport your sorry ass right where
             you stand --

                           MIDNITE


             JOHN.

John stops in his tracks.

                           JOHN

             It's bad enough that you let these
             half-breeds in at all but this
             piece of shit --

                           BALTHAZAR

             Perks of becoming a primary
             investor.

                           JOHN

             What?!
Midnite's eyes say it all -- not here, not now.

                           BALTHAZAR

             Things change, balances shift.
             Get used to it, Constantine.

                           JOHN

             Not while I'm still breathing --
John starts to cough again.

                           BALTHAZAR

             I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
John tries to catch his breath, can't. And that scares
him a bit. He tries to hide it, pushes out.




EXT. CLUB MIDNITE

John SLAMS out the exit -- coughing. He pulls the Vicks
44 from his jacket, struggles with the child protector
cap.

                           HENNESSEY

             Hey, John.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         26.





CONTINUED:

John is surprised to see Hennessey waiting. He chokes,
is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle.   Hennessey grabs
hold, twists off the cap with one flick. John guzzles
the syrup.

                           HENNESSEY

             I'm real sorry about this morning,
             John, real sorry. Please don't
             hate me for draggin' you into
             that. Please don't...
John can finally breathe.

                           JOHN

             I don't hate you.

                           HENNESSEY

             That's good to hear. Real good...

                           JOHN

             But could you at least wait until
             I call for you before you show up?

                           HENNESSEY

             You didn't call?

                           JOHN

             Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you
             freak me out sometimes.

                           HENNESSEY

             So you want me to go away and come
             back?

                           JOHN

             No. I've got an assignment for you.

                            HENNESSEY

             Really?   What kind of assignment?

                           JOHN

             The kind you'll have to be sober
             for.

                           HENNESSEY

             Oh God, you want me to surf the
             ether.
He instinctively touches an AMULET around his neck.       Four
intersecting crosses.

                           JOHN

             Come on, you know that exorcism
             wasn't right.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       27.

                           HENNESSEY

             I... I don't have the Sight
             anymore.

                           JOHN

             Don't have it or don't want to use
             it?
Hennessey vacillates.     This is obviously tough for him.

                           JOHN

             Just look around. A few days.
             You spot anything unusual,
             anything -- you let me know.
             Okay?
John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy,
then reaches behind his neck --

                           JOHN

             It'll be like old times.
-- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That
unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's
pocket.

                           JOHN

             Just for a few days.

                           HENNESSEY

             Okay, okay... for you, John.      Like
             old times. Right.
Hennessey takes one last sip from his drink, hands the
bottle over. John downs the rest. Nods.

Angela sits inside.

             I killed a man today.   Another

FATHER GARRET sits on the other side of the mesh window.

                           FATHER GARRET

             I'm sorry, Angela.

                           ANGELA

             Most cops go twenty years without
             firing their gun. Not me. I
             always seem to be in the wrong
             place at the wrong time.

Angela arrives home. Pours milk for a cat.     Lets her
hair down. Slips off her shoes.

                        ANGELA (V.O.)

          I didn't even see his face. I
          just pulled the trigger and he
          went away. Just like all the
          others...
Angela in the SHOWER -- trying to wash off the guilt.

                        FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

          These feelings are natural in your
          line of work, Angela. I'd be
          worried if you didn't have them.
Angela now in a recliner, cat in her lap.   She's tired.
Eyes are heavy.

                        FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

          But you have to be strong. You
          can't allow your faith to be
          overshadowed by guilt.

                         ANGELA (V.O.)

          I'm trying.
Her eyes close.

                        ANGELA (V.O.)

          I'm trying real hard.




INT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT

Angela's eyes open. An Angela whose frightened features
are dripping with a fever sweat.
She's in a hospital gown, stares around a corner.
Janitor polishes the floor in the distance. A nurse
checks off charts in the f.g. And right between the two
darts Angela, unseen by anyone.




EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

A metal fire door swings open and Angela bursts out --
breathing deep. She runs across the tar roof, almost
afraid to look back.

COURTYARD

-- where it SHATTERS --




INT. GROUND FLOOR HOSPITAL ROOM

The sound has drawn the attention of BARRY (10) lying in
bed. He moves up and stares out the window -- sees the
broken glass in the courtyard. He scans up the building
and spots a FIGURE standing on the roof.




ROOFTOP - WIDER

Chilling April air flutters Angela's gown, vaporizes her
breath. Tears stream down her cheeks as she contemplates
the unthinkable.
Cityscape of lights are spread out below but Angela is
seeing something else.

REFLECTED IN HER EYES --

is a city engulfed in RED FLAMES. Follow that tear with
the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek
and slips into her mouth.
ANGELA shudders, rubs her wrist where we see the skin has
swelled and reddened just like the Prisoner's. And
there's that same circular symbol in the flesh.
She wipes her tears -- tries to be strong. Takes a few
breaths for courage, them simply steps off.




INT. BARRY'S ROOM

BARRY'S WIDE EYES follow her down.




EXT. COURTYARD - LATER

Barry approaches across the barren courtyard, leans down
to Angela's contorted body. But she's still alive.
Barry stares into eyes that are fading fast. He reaches
out, touches her face. Eyes close. She's gone.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT

Angela stirs awake.   Disturbed.
OVER this we hear INCESSANT COUGHING --




                                                       30.





INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

John switches on the light, leans up from the sink and
wipes his mouth with a towel. It's covered with blood.
More runs down the drain. He stares at himself in the
mirror. ON John's worried eyes --

                                       MATCH CUT TO:





ANGLE - ANGELA'S EYES

looking equally distraught.

                        WEISS (V.O.)

          It's her, Angela...




EXT. RAVENSCAR HOSPITAL - WIDER - CONTINUOUS ACTION -


DAY

Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several officers
and medical personnel.

                         WEISS

          It's Isabel.
They arrive at the covered body in the courtyard.
Coroner sees Angela approach and lifts the sheet from the
face.
Angela comes to a dead stop, emotions coming fast and
furious.
She leans close and we see a mirror of Angela. That's
when you realize that wasn't a dream. This is her twin.
But that circular symbol is nowhere on her wrist now.
Angela's eyes well with tears. It takes everything she
has to stay in control. Helps to wrap herself in the
job. She steps back, looks up at the tall building.

                        ANGELA

          She... she fell from the roof?

                         WEISS

          No.   She jumped.
Angela gives him an incredulous glare.   Shakes her head.

                        WEISS

          I know it's hard to accept but --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                        31.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             Isabel would never in a million
             years take her own life. Never.

                           WEISS

             Angela... there was a surveillance
             camera on the roof.




INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

John marches down a hallway, his trench coat a step
behind. He unconsciously rubs his left wrist, coughs.
Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers.
John stops at a doctor's office door -- hesitates.




INT. RAVENSCAR - SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

View of the rooftop. There's Isabel in her nightgown,
stepping up -- pausing just a second. Then one step and
she's gone. So clear. So unrefutable.




WIDER

Angela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on her
shoulder.

                           WEISS (O.S.)

             Take some time...
Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the
others on the other side of the room. Whose hand was
that?




INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

A LINE OF LIGHT BOXES illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A
DARK sinister splotch snakes through both LUNGS. John
stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief.

                           JOHN

             No -- I've beaten things,
             insurmountable things, things most
             people have never even heard of
             and after all that you think I'm
             going to be done in by THIS?
He raises a puny little cigarette. DR. LES ARCHER (50)
sighs. A delicate bedside manner is not his specialty.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         32.





CONTINUED:


                           DR. ARCHER

             You wouldn't be the first, John.

                           JOHN

             It can't be that simple. I mean
             come on, Les, you saved me before.
             You can do it again, right.

                           DR. ARCHER

             This is different. This is
             aggressive.
John tries to stay cool -- fails.     He TRASHES the X-ray
boxes. Diseased lungs disappear.      Doc shakes his head.

                           DR. ARCHER

             Twenty years ago you didn't want
             to be here. Now you don't want to
             leave.

                           JOHN

             That's because I know exactly
             where I'm going this time.




INT. HALLWAY

John steps outside of the Doctor's office, pauses to
gather himself. He starts walking. Wants out of here
fast.




INT. RAVENSCAR - HALLWAY

Angela is on the move. Emotions are coming in strong.
She can't get out of here fast enough.
She aims for the elevators, sees a MAN has just entered
one.

                           ANGELA

                     (rushing toward it)
             Wait, hold the door!
Angela, gets to the elevator, looks in. John stands
inside alone. This should be the first time we realize
they were in the same hospital.

                           ANGELA

             Going down?
John pauses as the doors start to close.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                      33.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Not if I can help it.
The doors close right on Angela.




EXT. SOMEWHERE IN ISTANBUL - DAY

A PICKUP TRUCK crosses a barren landscape.
In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner.
He grips the relic tight in one hand.   That anxious fever
has returned.
Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising
jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're
on -- heading the opposite way.
Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic
tighter.
Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through
the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks
his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the
process.
Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. He
swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over
as driver.
Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and
into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising
airliners in the distance.




EXT. L.A. APARTMENT - DAY

Close to condemned status. SCAN UP floor after floor,
COMING TO REST ON a window covered with aluminum foil.




INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT

Every wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum
foil. A sober Hennessey stands surrounded by decades of
newspapers and periodicals -- tries to get his breathing
in check.
He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet
but it's not there. Oh yeah -- in the pocket. Decision
made, he reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the
walls and the window.




                                                       34.





EXT. ECHO PARK (DOWNTOWN L.A.) - DAY

John sits at a park bench. Motionless. Taking in the
world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows drifting across
the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars.
John just sits there, HEARING every breath he takes,
wondering which one will be his last.

                         ELLIE (O.S.)

          Lung cancer?   Lung cancer?!
John turns to see ELLIE (23) strutting up the sidewalk.
Uninhibited. Oozing sex appeal. But dangerous. In more
ways than you think.

                        ELLIE

          That's funny as shit, John.

                        JOHN

          As if you guys didn't have
          something to do with it...

                        ELLIE

          Hey, I think you brought this one
          on yourself.
John stares at her, tries to get a read.

                        ELLIE

          Now why wouldn't you trust me?

                        JOHN

          I don't know, something in the
          air --
She sits right on his lap, playfully.

                        ELLIE

          Don't worry, John, you'll beat
          this. You beat everything.

                        JOHN

          Not this time, Ellie.
John lifts her off of him, sets her aside.

                        ELLIE

          Oh wow, you're serious... No
          wonder the Boss is in such a good
          mood.

                        JOHN

          Yeah, I thought maybe you could
          talk to him for me. You know...?

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       35.





CONTINUED:

Ellie jumps off the bench, creates an odd SOUND as she
does.

                           ELLIE

             What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe
             you but to even ASK that? All
             those saints and martyrs slipping
             through his grasp -- his own foot
             soldiers sent back to him in
             chunks. He's going to take all
             that out on you, John, and he's
             going to enjoy ripping your soul
             to shreds until the end of time.

                           JOHN

             So I take that as a 'no?'

                           ELLIE

             You're the one soul the man
             himself would actually come up
             here to collect. And you know how
             much he despises this place.

                           JOHN

             I'm starting to see his point.
Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm.

                           ELLIE

             Have you gone to see the Snob?
Like scratching fingers across a blackboard.     No way.

                           ELLIE

             Look, don't let your ego get in
             the way on this. I'd miss having
             someone up here I can... relate
             to.
She gives him a kiss. And for a second John's leg is
brushed by a tail. John doesn't react. Just turns and
walks away.




INT./EXT. CHAZ'S TAXI - DAY

Seen through a mild rain is the Theological Society
building, a foreboding structure that looks out of place
for this city. John stares out the back seat window,
takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor. He turns to
Chaz --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         36.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             I'm sure I can get you in here.
Chaz gives the building another glance, shoves the meter
flag back down. Tick... tick... tick...

                           CHAZ

             Pass.




INT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - LATER

A few bishops talk quietly. A cardinal studies
Scriptures. Definitely not the place for atheists.
John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the --




LIBRARY

John stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front
of a fireplace. One is a young man of pure class wrapped
in Armani's best. The other is Father Garret.
John stands to the side and waits for their conversation
to end. An ATTENDANT makes the rounds.

                           ATTENDANT

             Can I take your coat, Mr.
             Constantine?

                           JOHN

             No thanks, I'm not staying long.

                           ATTENDANT

             How about you, ma'am?
Attendant turns to Angela standing just a few feet away,
her gaze fixed on the same two men.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not staying long either.
John glances over and for the second time they make
contact. Something about her eyes. John stares a bit
too long. Angela looks back toward the fireplace.

                           ANGELA

             My business with him is urgent.

                           JOHN

             First come, first served.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         37.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             So you're rude no matter where you
             are.
John gives her a look. The two men shake hands and start
to part. John and Angela make their move toward the men.
Both are surprised when Angela goes for Father Garret and
John goes for --
-- the SNOB, officially known as GABRIEL.       Yes, that one.




FATHER GARRET

and Angela have retreated to another area for privacy.

                           ANGELA

             Why is he stalling on this? My
             sister needs a Catholic funeral.

                           FATHER GARRET

             Angela, it's still considered a
             mortal sin --

                           ANGELA

             She didn't commit suicide.

                           FATHER GARRET

             The Bishop has read otherwise.

                           ANGELA

             Father... David -- this is Isabel.
                     (meeting his eyes)
             Please...
Father Garret stares at her, tries to be compassionate.

                           FATHER GARRET

             I'll talk to him again.
But Angela has just lost a load of faith.




BY THE FIREPLACE

Gabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with
unblinking eyes. John approaches from behind and against
the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings.
The ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat.

                           GABRIEL

                     (without looking back)
             I know what you want, son.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         38.





CONTINUED:

John sits across from him.

                           JOHN

             Been keeping your all-seeing eye
             on me, have you?

                           GABRIEL

             I could offer how a shepherd leads
             even the most wayward of his flock
             but it might sound disingenuous.

                           JOHN

             So you're going to make me beg?
Angela pauses on her way out, looks over.

                           GABRIEL

             It wouldn't help. You've already
             wasted your chance at redemption.

                           JOHN

             What about the minions I've sent
             back, the souls that I've saved --
             that should guarantee my passage
             across --

                           GABRIEL

                     (keeping it private)
             -- No -- passage requires faith
             and faith by definition is belief
             without proof. You have proof.
             And that means you're not playing
             by the same rules as everyone
             else. Your work has mostly been
             for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.

                           JOHN

             This is bullshit -- bullshit!
Now he's really got Angela's attention.

                           JOHN

             It's like you've got some cosmic
             scale weighing everything we do --
             help an old lady across the
             street -- put in a nickel, kick a
             dog, take out a dime -- you're
             fucking nickel and diming us to
             death down here!

                           GABRIEL

             Keep your voice down.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                     39.





CONTINUED:

John jumps up, leans into his face.

                           JOHN

             And you know what, you're the ones
             with the problem, not us -- You make
             these impossible rules to decide who
             goes up, who goes down and you don't
             even understand us --
This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin.

                           GABRIEL

             Each of you is born with the
             promise of salvation preordained.
             The cost of your redemption is
             simple belief. And yet you whine
             about impossible rules. Sometimes
             I imagine you hardly deserve the
             gift you have been given.

                           JOHN

             Gift?! More like a curse the way
             you manage things.
Gabriel stands and towers over John.

                           GABRIEL

             I am taking your situation into
             account, John, but don't push me.

                           JOHN

             Why me, Gabriel? It's personal,
             isn't it? I didn't go to church
             enough? I didn't pray enough? I
             was five bucks short in the
             collection plate? Why?
Gabriel moves right up to him, makes this very personal.

                           GABRIEL

             You're going to die because you
             smoked 30 cigarettes a day since
             you were 15. And you're going to
             Hell because of the life you took.
             Or to put it in a way that your kind
             would understand. You're fucked.




EXT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - MINUTES LATER

Angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour.
She hears a cough, looks over to see John standing on the
other side, looking equally frayed. They share another
glance.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                          40.





CONTINUED:

John fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.        Empty.

                           JOHN

             He has a rotten sense of humor.
                     (steps past)
             And his punch lines are killers.
John tosses the cigarette pack, walks right into the
RAIN, away from Chaz's taxi pulling up.

                            CHAZ

                      (shouting out)
             John?   It's raining! Hey!
Angela watches John disappear in the rain, looks down at
the empty cigarette pack.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:





INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT - A CIGARETTE PACK

lies on the floor next to food wrappers, Coke bottles and
stacks of newspapers. Hennessey sits amongst the
garbage, slumped over. But he's not sleeping.
He's surfing the ether. Allowing his sixth sense to
guide him. His hands move down and across the stacks of
newer periodicals, fingers probing the layers of
information.
Left hand suddenly stops.
Hennessey's eyes open. He removes the layers of periodicals
on top of his left hand, leans close. Edges his fingers
away and sees an OBITUARY. A name -- Isabel Dodson.




EXT. L.A. STREETS - EVENING

John walks the streets, numb to the world. A rat
scurries past near the curb. Then another. Several
crows fly by.
Above him is a BILLBOARD - "YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT."
Doesn't matter that below it is -- "TO BUY A NEW CHEVY."
The point is crystal clear. John shakes his head, breaks
out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit.
He leans to a gutter. Another rat scoots past. John
barely notices. Then a frog jumps past. But it's the
crab crawling by that finally catches John's gaze.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        41.





CONTINUED:


                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)

             Hey, buddy, you got a light?
John turns, settles on a silhouetted figure standing
behind him, unlit cigarette butt in its mouth.

                           OLD MAN

                     (coughs)
             We gotta stick together, right?
John gathers himself. As he walks over to this OLD MAN,
he rummages through his coat pocket, retrieves a
matchbox.
The box shudders as a high-pitch FLUTTERING filters from
inside. Old Man winces as his entire body VIBRATES.
John realizes -- this is Beeman's matchbox, the one with
the screech beetle inside. And now he knows -- a beat
too late.
Old Man attacks.
John is knocked onto his haunches. As the Old Man closes
in, he's revealed in more detail. Body and face are
actually an intricate puzzle, an assemblage of city
vermin. Rats, insects, crows, frogs, crabs -- all held
together in the shape of a man.
John scampers backwards, just inches from this being's
outstretched grasp. He shakes the matchbox and the
screech beetle inside flutters again.
Old Man/Demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart
for a second, then snaps back together. He GRABS onto
John with fingers of squirming vermin. Snake wraps
around his wrist. Crab snaps at his skin.
John shakes the beetle box harder -- causing the parts to
vibrate even further. Old Man grabs John's head and
vermin of various leg count crawl right onto John's face.
John's had enough -- shakes the matchbox violently, then
smashes it against the sidewalk.
BEETLE lets out a death SHRIEK and the Old Man
stutters -- his parts vibrating so wildly you can
actually see the b.g. through the seams.
John scampers loose, grabs a road barricade and swings it
with all his might. Old Man form shatters on impact.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                        42.





CONTINUED:

The entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of
scattering critters. John starts stomping on them as
they scatter into the city.
John stands there, shocked and concerned.      What the hell
is going on?




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - DAY

That surveillance VIDEO FOOTAGE from Ravenscar plays
again. There's Isabel in her nightgown walking across
the roof.
Spread out on a cluttered coffee table is Isabel's case
file. CORONER'S REPORT is opened. Let's see "NO DRUGS
IN SYSTEM" and the biggie -- "Cause of Death -- SUICIDE."
Angela sits on the couch in her robe.      Disheveled and
distraught. She's taking this hard.

                           ANGELA

             I'm sorry, Isabel...
She lowers her head.     And in that brief moment of
silence --

                           ISABEL (V.O.)

                     (on TV)
             Constantine.
Angela snaps back to the TV, freezes in shock.
There's Isabel ready to jump but this time she's looking
right back AT us -- at Angela. Then she's gone.
Angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence
again. This time Isabel doesn't look back. This time
there is no name. But Angela did see it. Did hear it.
She sits for a second.     Stunned.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE

John paces as Midnite works on that Universal orrery,
adjusting components but balance continues to elude him.

                           JOHN

             A few months, maybe a year.
             That's it. End of story. Game
             over.

CONTINUED:


                            JOHN (CONT'D)

                      (as Midnite doesn't
                       react)
             Well, don't break down on my
             account.

                           MIDNITE

             What do you want from me?   A
             shoulder to cry on?

                           JOHN

             This bastard attacked me right out
             in the open -- on Sepulveda no
             less.

                           MIDNITE

             They don't like you, John. You've
             deported how many back to Hell?

                           JOHN

             That's just it -- this wasn't some
             possession or wayward half breed,
             it was a full-fledged demon.
             Here. On our plane.

                           MIDNITE

             Right.

                           JOHN

             I know what I saw.

                           MIDNITE

             You must have just crossed over
             and didn't even realize it --

                           JOHN

             I didn't cross over -- It was on
             this side. Here.

                           MIDNITE

             -- it's wet out, you're wandering
             around aimlessly, not to mention
             completely emotional --

                           JOHN

             Emotional?!
John slams a fist against the counter. The orrery almost
topples but Midnite saves it. Decades of work almost
lost.
Midnite glares at a desperate John.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         44.





CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             Okay, so you saw something. We've
             seen a few small ones slip through
             now and then.

                           JOHN

             It's more than that... first the
             girl, then this.

                           MIDNITE

             John, you know my connections.
             Any shifts or tremors in the
             planes and I'd hear about it.
John just shakes his head, looks up -- convinced.

                           JOHN

             Something's coming.
Midnite sighs, gives up with him.




INT. LAPD OFFICE - LATER

The name JOHN CONSTANTINE is center screen on a
monitor -- typed into the police station's SEARCH ENGINE.
Angela sits alone in the squad room, rain streaking
across the windows.
Interpol comes back with results and a list of priors
scroll under John's name.
Must be a hundred PARKING VIOLATIONS. Several SPEEDING
tickets and a few RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. In fact John's
license has been REVOKED.
But it's the other incidents that draw Angela in.

BRIEF CLOSEUPS

Of specific words in a few HEADLINES -- "Occult activity
on the rise..." "Claimed possession is refuted by
Bishop..." "Satanic cult dissolved..."
Accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos.
-- BLOOD PATTERNS on a WALL -- Odd SYMBOLS burned into a
ceiling. A cross burnt to a crisp.
-- JOHN in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her
son in her arms. A younger and more noble Father
Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        45.





CONTINUED:

Another line -- "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to PROSECUTE."
Angela scrolls, sees cities listed where John has made
waves -- LONDON -- PARIS -- ROME -- BUDAPEST -- MOSCOW.
Stops on the one that matters -- LOS ANGELES. And
there's an address.
Angela hits PRINT and the HP HUMS away.
A desk PHONE RINGS. Angela quickly looks around, sees
she's the only one here. She gets up, answers it.

                            ANGELA

             L.A.P.D.   This is Dodson, hello?
Dead air. The next PHONE RINGS. Angela reaches for it
when the NEXT ONE RINGS, and the NEXT, the NEXT.
The RINGS HOP phone to phone in intimidating mockery.
Angela freezes, forces herself to stay calm.     Sure
enough, the RINGS abruptly CEASE.
Angela reaches over, rips the page from the printer,
leaves.




INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT - DAY

A police guard scans passengers and a printout of the
Prisoner. He walks past a man standing in the metal
detector line.
This is actually the Prisoner wearing the clothes and
glasses of the Driver. Is that a blood stain on the
lapel?
Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the
iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver. He
has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt.




MYSTERIOUS POV

Watching the Prisoner.      He looks back AT us, suspicious.
Nothing there.




PRISONER

looks back nervously, as his bag goes through the
detector.




                                                         46.





DETECTOR SCREEN

shows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and
nothing else. The iron relic doesn't even produce an
outline.
Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can't believe his
luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates.




EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

VARIOUS of the city -- the contrasts between the bright
and cheerful and the dark and mysterious. That abandoned
mission behind Bob's Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged
between competing banks.

COME TO REST ON --

The towering statue of The Good Shepherd. His hands are
welcoming us into the "HOLY CROSS CEMETERY."
Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley.




INT. 20 LANES - THE BAR

John drinks alone.   Pissed at life.      At death.
That small black box of his lies on the table unopened.
Spider runs across the table. John flips an empty glass,
traps it underneath. He takes a drag on his cigarette,
tips the glass and blows smoke inside. Spider can't
escape the poison air, bumps the glass. Trapped. Dying.

                        JOHN

          Welcome to my life.

                        ANGELA (O.S.)

          Mr. Constantine?
John looks up, spots Angela.        Those eyes again.

                        ANGELA

          I saw you at --

                           JOHN

          -- I remember.

                           ANGELA

          And --

                           JOHN

          Yeah.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          47.





CONTINUED:

She did make an impression.

                           ANGELA

             I'd like to ask you a few
             questions.

                           JOHN

             I'm not really in the talking mood
             right now.

                           ANGELA

             Could you just listen then?
Angela sets her LAPD detective badge on the table.

                           ANGELA

             Please?

                           JOHN

             Always a catch...
Angela sits across from him, puts the badge away.

                           ANGELA

             My sister was murdered last week.

                           JOHN

             Sorry to hear...

                           ANGELA

             Her name was Isabel.   Isabel
             Dodson?
She looks for a reaction.     None.

                           ANGELA

             You don't remember her?

                           JOHN

             Never met her.

                           ANGELA

             You sure?

                           JOHN

             She look anything like you?
                     (as Angela nods)
             I would've remembered.
Another beat as their eyes meet.       John looks away.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         48.

                           ANGELA

             She was a patient at Ravenscar.
             Then last Tuesday she just decided
             to step off the roof.

                           JOHN

             I thought you said she was murdered?

                           ANGELA

             Isabel would never take her own life.

                           JOHN

             You'd be surprised at what people
             will do.

                           ANGELA

             Look, I know I'm not making much
             sense -- hell I'm not really sure
             what I'm doing here... I just
             feel -- the circles you travel
             in -- the occult, demonology,
             exorcisms...
John just stares at that spider in the glass.       Trapped.

                           ANGELA

             I believe someone got to her, Mr.
             Constantine, brainwashed her into
             stepping off that roof. Some kind
             of legion or cult.

                           JOHN

             Sounds like a theory.   Good luck.

                           ANGELA

             Well I thought with your
             background and experience, you
             could at least point me in the
             right direction.

                            JOHN

             Yeah, okay.   Sure.
John points -- toward the exit.      Angela is not amused.
But she's not giving up.

                           ANGELA

             My sister always talked about a
             world better than this. Heaven as
             some call it. She wasn't afraid
             of dying because she knew it was
             waiting for her. What everyone
             fails to grasp is that if she had
             really taken her own life --

CONTINUED:


                            JOHN

             -- she would have committed a
             mortal sin and her soul would have
             gone straight to Hell where it
             would never feel love or
             compassion or anything but pain
             again as the master himself rips
             her apart over and over for the
             rest of eternity.
                     (beat)
             That about right?
The words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless.
John sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it
back -- but it's too late.
She turns and starts out, slows --

                           ANGELA

             You're not the only one afraid of
             Hell.
John tries not to let that get to him. She leaves. He
glances out the window, watches her pass by. So long.
Good riddance.
But something's not right. Those deep shadows on the
buildings seem to be moving. John watches, confused,
realizes they're heading in Angela's direction.

                           JOHN

             Oh shit...
He stands, gains his bearings. As he walks out he flicks
the glass over. Spider runs free.




EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Cars are lined all the way down the street. Angela walks
along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her.
It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in
with each step.

                           JOHN (O.S.)

             Detective!
Angela looks back, sees John in the street.

                           JOHN

             How open is your mind?

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         50.





CONTINUED:

She doesn't answer, continues walking. What she doesn't
see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But
John does. He starts walking toward her.

                           JOHN

             Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?
                     (off no answer)
             How about what comes out of each?
Angela keeps walking.      He catches up with her.

                           JOHN

             Hey!

                           ANGELA

             You mean like angels?

                           JOHN

             And demons.
Angela stares at him, continues walking.       He keeps up.

                           JOHN

             See, you don't have the mindset
             for this kind of work.
They walk together down the lonely street.

                           ANGELA

             Look, I see terrible things every
             day. A mother drowns her baby. A
             ten-year-old shoots his father.
             But it's not demons, it's the evil
             that men do.
Behind them, a streetlight BLINKS OUT. Then another.
They're not looking back so they don't see it.

                           JOHN

             You're right, we're capable of
             terrible things but we usually
             justify it with motives like money
             and power and jealousy.
Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out.

                           JOHN

             Then sometimes, something comes
             along and gives us just the right
             nudge and we do truly evil things
             just for the kick of it.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                             51.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             I don't believe in demons.

                            JOHN

             You should.   They believe in us.
They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then
blacks out. Both look up.
The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT.
Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind
them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight
ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING

BRIGHT.


                           JOHN

             We should go...
Second later it BLINKS OFF.         John grabs her hand --

                             JOHN

             Fast.
Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural
WIND races toward them.
John jerks her into action. They run towards the next
light. It blinks out right when they reach it.
They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety
of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd.




EXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY

They make it through the gate, pass through an alley of
overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES through the
branches -- flitters right past Angela's face. She swats
at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek.
They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER,
fade out. Statues of saints become dark monoliths.
John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a mausoleum.
A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination.
Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of
blood. Now she hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like
LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding them.

                             ANGELA

             What is that?

                                                  (CONTINUED)





                                                         52.





CONTINUED:

John is just as surprised he's saying this --

                           JOHN

             Wings.

                           ANGELA

             Wings?
John rummages through his trench coat -- fishes out that
cloth Beeman gave him. The one supposedly wrapped around
Moses.

                           JOHN

             And maybe talons.
The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer...

                           ANGELA

             Are you kidding? Of what?

                           JOHN

             Something that's not supposed to
             be here.
John quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand.
Angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get
CLOSER -- ghastly sound of MOVEMENT in the fringes of
light.
The cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with
every second the circle of light gets smaller and those
SOUNDS GET CLOSER. John takes out his special lighter.

                           JOHN

             Close your eyes.
They are now standing in pitch darkness.

                           ANGELA

             Why?

                           JOHN

             Suit yourself.
John flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion --
sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand.
Sacred cloth catches fire -- then IGNITES with a
brilliant retina-searing FLASH -- blinding Angela and
illuminating a --
-- CIRCLE OF WINGED DEMONS -- a roiling broth of
reptilian death -- right there -- ready to pounce.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         53.





CONTINUED:

RED FLAME radiates from the cloth and DEMONS SHRIEK as
they are instantly vaporized.
John tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket,
extinguishes the flame. He leans down to a rubbery stain
left from one of the burnt demon carcasses. Shakes his
head in disbelief.

                           JOHN

                     (to himself)
             'I accidentally crossed over?'    I
             don't think so.

                           ANGELA

                     (coming up behind)
             What was that? I saw wings -- and
             teeth -- they were flying. What
             the hell were those things?!

                           JOHN

             They weren't angels.
John scans the area, trying to think this through.

                           JOHN

             Seplavites, actually. Scavengers
             for the damned.
                     (off her lost look)
             Demons?

                           ANGELA

             What? You can't be serious...
             this is impossible...

                           JOHN

             Yeah...
                     (to himself)
             And I don't think they were after
             me...
John looks at her with renewed interest.

                           JOHN

             You really believe she wouldn't
             commit suicide?

                           ANGELA

                     (a bit thrown)
             My sister?
                     (a beat)
             Never in a million years.
John makes the decision.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        54.





CONTINUED:


                             JOHN

             Let's be sure.
He starts walking.     Angela is now compelled to follow.

                             ANGELA

             How?

                            JOHN

             Simple.   See if she's in Hell.




EXT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Not exactly an inviting place.
Hennessey steps off the curb, looks up at his
destination.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John stares at a photo of Angela and her father in police
uniform. Obviously happier times.
Angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box.
That gray cat follows close to her heels.

                           ANGELA

             These are all Isabel's things.

                             JOHN

             The cat too?

                             ANGELA

             Yeah, why...?
John ignores the box of items, picks up the cat. He
studies it a bit, then sits back in a chair with it.

                           ANGELA

             Don't you need candles and a
             pentagram for this to work?

                           JOHN

                     (deadpan)
             Why, do you have any?
John puts his feet, shoes and all into a BUCKET OF WATER.

                           JOHN

             I need you to step outside now.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      55.





CONTINUED:

Angela wants to stay.

                            JOHN

             Angela?   Please.
Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the
cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a
moment where animal and man seem to connect.
The water around John's feet begins to BOIL.
ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on
its way to latch.
Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers,
is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John
has now crossed over into --




APARTMENT IN HELL

Same layout, different decorator. John takes a deep,
raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall behind
him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed
structure in Beirut.
Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a
nightscape but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not
quite night.
John steps over the crumbling wall into --




EXT. HELL LOS ANGELES

John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze
of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long-
forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE
penetrates the silence.

                             JOHN

             Is she here?
On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut
through the putrid brown haze.

                             JOHN

             Is she here?!
His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                          56.





CONTINUED:

John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down
to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're
crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking
down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief.

                              JOHN


             IS SHE HERE?!

That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge
blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape,
rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this
isn't a safe place for the living.

                            JOHN

             It's a simple question!    Is she
             here or not?!!
John suddenly locks on something far off.
On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a
sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows
she's looking right at him.

                              JOHN

             Isabel?
She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a
small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing
darkness.




INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY

In that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes
pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES --

                           JOHN (O.S.)

                     (weakly)
             Angela... come back in...
Confused, Angela pushes the door back open. Cat BOLTS
out. Angela catches her breath, moves inside.




INT. LIVING ROOM

John sits slumped in the chair, drained. Steam rises off
his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost
all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him.

                              ANGELA

             John?     What happened?

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                       57.





CONTINUED:

Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm --
reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name
"ISABEL DODSON" is typed on it.
Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors
Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight --
tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain
overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor.
John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches
out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder.
The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and
Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this
close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes
herself.

                            ANGELA

             How?   How did you do this...?
John tries not to stare into those eyes too long.     Fails.




INT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a
cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type.
Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room
again, makes sure he's still alone.
He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and
lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead.
Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last.
Hennessey shudders. This is it.
He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void --

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             When I was a kid, I saw things...




FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET - DAY

A TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk
in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Things I wasn't supposed to.
The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face
is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are
dug into the ground.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           WAITRESS (O.S.)

             Coffee?
Young John looks up toward the voice --




INT. DINER - NIGHT (PRESENT)

John looks up at the Waitress.

                           JOHN

             Tea.
She leaves. Angela sits across from him.      They're at the
table by the window.

                           JOHN

             My parents sent me to a doctor, a
             shrink, a priest. I was in four
             different institutions by the time
             I was eighteen.
Angela notes him rubbing his wrist.

                            JOHN

             The last place they put me was run
             by a church...
A DOCTOR rushes past their table.     PAN WITH him INTO...




FLASHBACK - INT. MENTAL INSTITUTION - HALLWAY

The Doctor rushes toward distant SCREAMING.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             The revered Father made the
             brilliant deduction that I was
             possessed, said I needed to be
             exorcised...




INT. ROOM - HIGH ANGLE

The Doctor runs in. Sees the revered Father below,
leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is held down
by three interns and that Doctor. John angrily screams
at them all.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             It was like someone trying to pull
             teeth that weren't there.
Young John clamps his eyes shut tight.




                                                      59.





INT. DINER - JOHN (PRESENT)

Present-day John does the same, remembering the pain.

                        JOHN

          So I took things into my own hands
          and I found a way out.

                        ANGELA

          You attempted suicide.
John sees she's looking at his wrist. The hint of a
jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve.

                        JOHN

          I never attempt anything.
John's reflection in the window becomes --




FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN

kneeling with a pair off scissors.     He's inside a...




INT. CLASSROOM

Teenage John looks up at a room filled with people from
all walks of life. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, garbage
men. All somewhat different than normal. They sit in
school chairs and wait for John to do the deed.
He puts the blade to his wrist -- one swipe and the world
around him accelerates away in a STREAKED BLUR --




INT. DINER (PRESENT)


                        ANGELA

          But you're still here.    Alive.

                           JOHN

          Not my doing.
His chest suddenly HEAVES forward -- and we're on...




FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN

as he's jolted by DEFIB PADS.     He's in the back of a...




INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING

Paramedics are soaked in sweat. One looks a bit like a
young Dr. Archer. Heart monitor is FLAT LINE. There's
little hope.




                                                     60.





EXT. LOS ANGELES

The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming.
From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Officially I was dead for seven
          minutes. But believe me, seven
          minutes in Hell is a lifetime.
Ambulance heads toward that dying RED SUN.




INT. AMBULANCE

FLAT LINE on the monitor suddenly SPIKES with a pulse --




INT. MORGUE (PRESENT)

Hennessey's hand jerks back from the plastic. His eyes
fix on Isabel's wrist. That odd circular SYMBOL is back.
Hennessey's unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed.
He rushes out, slams right into a SECURITY GUARD coming
in.

                        SECURITY GUARD

          Hey, what're you doing in here?
Guard looks back into the body room, sees a drawer
partially open. He walks over, pulls it out further --
sees the plastic cut away. Jesus.
The symbol has already faded from Isabel's wrist.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          When I returned I didn't just see
          demons anymore, I could do the one
          thing they couldn't -- come and go
          as I please.




EXT. MORGUE - HENNESSEY

runs as fast as a very obese man can -- aiming for that
PHONE BOOTH on the corner. He grabs the receiver,
punches numbers as fast as he can. RING -- RING --

RING --


                        HENNESSEY

          Be there, John... please...
Something shivers up Hennessey's leg and into his body.
Eyes glaze over and Hennessey settles on a RESTAURANT.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Heaven and Hell are right here,
             behind every wall, every face --
             the world behind the world. It's
             crossing over that's the real
             trick. That's why most demons can
             only whisper in our ears. But
             even a whisper can turn your
             favorite pleasure into your worst
             nightmare.




INT. LATE NIGHT RESTAURANT

HENNESSEY barges in, squeezes past the MAITRE D'.

                           MAITRE D'

             Sir, you need a reservation!
But Hennessey is on a quest.     For food.   And it's
everywhere.
He starts grabbing meals right off of plates. Fish,
pasta, prime rib. Shovels it all in. Patrons are
yelling -- screaming. He's eating as if his life
depended on it. And even though he's devouring anything
in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes.
In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly
eating his meal. Balthazar.
Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on
it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside
gets thinner.
He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it
back so he bites into his arm. She screams as her
husband pulls her away.
Hennessey's strength is withering away. Desperate, he
grabs a FORK, digs it into his own hand.
A Hispanic BUSBOY rushes into the room, grabs onto
Hennessey.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             But the worst demons are the ones
             that are allowed to be here -- the
             ones that are half-human so they
             blend in...
Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and
starts toward the back EXIT.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         62.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN (V.O.)

             ... just like those with the
             angel's touch living alongside of
             us. The half-breeds.
That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor. For a moment
we see him framed against the front doorway. And in that
instant we get a brief glimpse of --




ALTERNATE LOS ANGELES

An incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light.




BACK TO SCENE

BUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes. Bitter enemies.
Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers. He
leaves out the back exit.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             They call it 'the Balance.' I
             call it hypocritical bullshit.




INT. DINER


                           JOHN

             So when one of them gets a little
             cocky, peddles their influence or
             hijacks a soul -- I deport their
             scaly ass right back to Hell.
                     (takes a sip of tea)
             I don't get them all but maybe
             enough to insure my retirement.

                           ANGELA

             Sounds like you're trying to buy
             your way into Heaven.

                           JOHN

             Well, what would you do if you
             were sentenced to a prison where
             half the inmates were put there by
             you?
Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him.

                           ANGELA

             Why you? I mean many go to Hell,
             why were you able to escape?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          63.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

                     (sips tea)
             I don't know.

                           ANGELA

             God has a plan for all of us.

                           JOHN

             Not for me.
John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at
him -- finally --

                           ANGELA

             Isabel saw things too.
John looks up. Moment is lost when her CELLULAR RINGS.
The cop in her reacts, flips it open.

                           ANGELA

             Detective Dodson here.




EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER

The morgue is seen across the street.     The Guard that
chased Hennessey is just outside.

                           WEISS (O.S.)

             Security Guard spotted him near
             the body, chased him out.
We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.       Around them is
a complete shambles of fine dining --

                           WEISS

             He comes over here, makes a run at
             the entire menu and pow --
             deflates like a fricken Macy's day
             balloon.
-- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down
at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an
assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore
is familiar now.
John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop
starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be.
John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into
Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he
himself removed from his friend. That's even more
crushing.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                    64.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Shit...
                     (sympathetic)
             Why didn't you call me, you fat
             sonna bitch...
John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of
Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the
fork wound. The blood is already drying over it.
John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and
grabs a melting ice cube.
He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried
blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random
stabbings. This is a shape.
John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses.
Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin.
It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist.
John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important.

                           JOHN

                     (to Hennessey)
             Rest in peace, Father.




INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES

With a loud crowd and 20 huge PIN MACHINES GRINDING AWAY
the noise back here is DEAFENING. But this is Beeman's
home. See the desk, the TV. The fold-away bed.
Beeman is on the phone. There's a conversation but it's
way too noisy to hear. All we see are the emotions on
Beeman's face. No doubt news of Hennessey's death is one
of the biggies.
Beeman quickly reaches for a marker, puts it to paper and
starts drawing -- listening and drawing --
He's finished, hangs up. Stares at the Symbol. That
cabinet with the ancient books now gets his attention.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             I need to see where Isabel died.




EXT. EAST LA - NIGHT

Graffiti-adorned walls give way to a tall iron fence,
heavily-shadowed grounds and finally the six-story
hospital complex of RAVENSCAR.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         65.





CONTINUED:

A rim-lit figure stands on the roof. But this one isn't
wearing a hospital gown, he's wearing a trench coat.

                           ANGELA (V.O.)

             Seances, crystals -- channeling...
             Our father thought she was just
             trying to get attention. She
             certainly did that.




EXT. ROOFTOP

Angela stands behind John. A large water tank is
anchored to the roof next to her. Note the FLAME logo.

                           ANGELA

             She'd tell everyone about things
             she said she saw. Crazy things.
             Things that hadn't happened yet.
             She'd scare my mother to death,
             talking on and on about
             Revelations and the end of the
             world. Then one day she just
             stopped... never said another
             word.

                           JOHN

             So you put her in here.
Angela doesn't need to be reminded.     It hurts even more now.

                           JOHN

             Show me her room.




INT. CORRIDOR

John and Angela head toward Isabel's room. A NURSE
appears from around the corner walking with a boy. It's
Barry, the boy in the courtyard.
He locks on Angela and when she makes eye contact he
breaks away from the Nurse, runs toward her with arms
outstretched.

                           NURSE

             Barry!
He runs right into Angela's arms, hugs her tight. Angela
is totally baffled. John is thoroughly intrigued.

                           NURSE

             Oh God...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         66.





CONTINUED:

She rushes in, gently tugs the boy away.

                           NURSE

             No, Barry, that's not Isabel.
Barry stares at Angela. He reaches out, touches her
face, confused. Nurse pulls him back even further.

                           NURSE

             I'm sorry. They were friends. He
             kind of had a crush on your sister.
Angela nods, understanding. The Nurse leads Barry away.
He doesn't take his eyes off Angela the entire time.
Neither does John.

                           JOHN

             You were twins.
Angela nods, steps inside.      John pauses, thinking.




INT. ISABEL'S ROOM

John steps inside, gives the sterile room a thorough
scan.

                            JOHN

             So how long?

                            ANGELA

             Two months.
                     (beat)
             This time.
He pulls out a drawer, looks at the bottom.

                           ANGELA

             I already did all that.
John runs his hands under the steel bed frame.

                           ANGELA

             Now you're insulting me.

                           JOHN

             You don't walk off a building
             without leaving something behind.

                           ANGELA

             You saw everything she left
             behind. In that box.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                          67.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Maybe she left something else.
             Something more personal. Just for
             you.
Angela doesn't like that look he's giving her.

                           JOHN

             You were her twin, Angela.    Twins
             tend to think alike.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not like my sister.

                           JOHN

             But you were at once time. When
             you were kids. When you'd spend
             every waking hour with each other.
             You'd start a sentence, she'd
             finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd
             cry.

                           ANGELA

             That was a long time ago...

                           JOHN

             That kind of bond doesn't just
             disappear.

                           ANGELA

             There's nothing here.
Angela seems unbalanced.     John gets more aggressive.

                           JOHN

             She planned her death in this
             room, she thought it up right
             where you're standing --
Angela backs away.     John advances.

                           JOHN

             She knew you'd come -- She counted
             on you to see what she saw, to
             feel what she felt -- to do what
             she did. What did she do, Angela?

                           ANGELA

             How should I know?

                           JOHN

             What did she do, Angela?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          68.





CONTINUED:


                             ANGELA

             I don't know!

                           JOHN

             What would you do?
Angela backs into a wall.       Nowhere else to go now.

                           JOHN

             What would you leave her? What
             would it be? Where would it be?!
             Where would it be?
Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of
her way. She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating.
John stays back, watches. Angela opens her eyes. The
tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees --

                             ANGELA

             The tree.




EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

A lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard.
John and Angela approach it. Examine it. Nothing. John
drops lower on the tree, to a child's height.   Finally
sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela.
She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees.
That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into his
hand. But this time there's more.

                           ANGELA

                     (trying to
                      rationalize)
             There must have been a tree in our
             backyard... when we were kids...
John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything.
His fingers trace these words carved below the symbol --

                             JOHN


             'COR 14:01.'


                             ANGELA

             Cor?

                             JOHN

             Corinthians.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                    69.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

                     (shaking her head)
             There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
John's face goes pale --

                           JOHN

             I need a church.




INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER

Several families sit in solemn prayer. The pastor
comforts a man and wife. John and Angela slip through,
head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall.
They whisper.

                           JOHN

             Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the
             book of Ethenius. It's like a
             dark mirror of the Bible. It
             paints a different view of
             Revelations, says that the world
             will not come to an end at the
             hand of God but be reborn in the
             embrace of the damned.

                           ANGELA

             There's a difference?

                           JOHN

             Depends on which side of the fence
             you're standing.
John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl
of holy water near the altar.

                           ANGELA

             So why haven't I seen this book
             before?

                           JOHN

             Because it doesn't exist here on
             this side.
John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to

BOIL --


                           ANGELA (O.S.)

             What do you mean --
Flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela
mid-question and the room in that dim half-light.
John turns and is inside --




                                                     70.





SAME CHAPEL - HELL

The epitome of blasphemy -- A church in Hell. Only they
don't worship God in here. And that's not Christ on the
cross. And those stained glass windows are now slate
black.
John is now facing books with completely different
markings. He searches as a DRONE rises in pitch and an
INKY BLACKNESS begins to flow down the walls, getting
closer to John with each heartbeat.
He finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes --




REGULAR CHAPEL


                        ANGELA

          -- not here on this side?
John turns, covered in sweat. He's holding a book she's
never seen, is already flipping through it.

                        ANGELA

          Where did that come from?

                        JOHN

                  (stopping to read)
          13:29. 13:30 -- Here...
          Corinthians 14:01...
                  (skimming to this)
          'The sins of the father would only
          be exceeded by the ego of the
          son.'

                        ANGELA

          Whose son?
John stands, his brain going into overdrive.

                        JOHN

          Symbol isn't a demon's... that's
          why I couldn't place it... not a
          normal possession...

                        ANGELA

          John, what are you talking about?

                        JOHN

          But he can't cross over --
          impossible for the son to cross
          over...

                         ANGELA

          Whose son?   God's?

             No.  The other one.
                     (off her look)
             Lucifer had a son too.




INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES

Beeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp. The narrow
alley of machines stretches out behind him. He stares
into the scrolls -- an ancient book with a single page
folded a thousand times. Turns another page.




BOWLING AREA

Amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's
closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness,
the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of
beasts.

                           BEEMAN (O.S.)

             Oh my...




BEHIND THE LANES

Beeman has stopped turning pages. That's because he's
now staring at an etching of the same symbol. Below are
ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body.
But it's what's above the beast that is most troubling.
A figure on a cross -- his arms outstretched -- seemingly
welcoming the beast into this world.

                           BEEMAN

             This is not good...
BOWLING BALL hits a lane.     Beeman spins to the sound.
BALL ROLLS round and round, closer and closer until it
CLANGS dead against the back wall of one of the lanes.
Beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin
machines.
He stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the
machinery and peeks out the pin hole.

                           BEEMAN

             John?




                                                     72.





EXT. LA STREETS - NIGHT

Angela's SUV races quickly through traffic while John
gets her up to speed.

                         JOHN (V.O.)

           The myth says Mammon was conceived
           before his father's fall from
           grace but was born after.




INT. SUV


                         JOHN

           But unlike his old man, he's never
           been in the presence of the Creator
           so he has no fear of him, no respect
           either. That goes double for us --
           God's most prized creations. Mammon
           would be the last demon we'd ever
           want crossing over.

                         ANGELA

           But demons can't come and go,
           that's what you said.

                         JOHN

           Unless they found a bridge.
                   (off her look)
           Some psychic with the chops to
           reach all the way to Hell and the
           grit to withstand whatever shit
           she'd pull out.

                          ANGELA

           Isabel...

                         JOHN

           But even a bridge wouldn't help
           Mammon. Because to cross over, the
           myth says he'd still need the one
           thing he could never get. Divine
           assistance. The help of God.
Angela sits back, letting that sink in.

                         ANGELA

           So it's impossible.

                         JOHN

           Impossible? Sure it's impossible.
           That's what makes it so dangerous.
           These things exist to break the
           rules, to find the loopholes. If
           the past is any indication, then
           the future isn't on our side.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         73.





CONTINUED:

John sits back, gut churning.       Angela's in detective mode.

                          ANGELA

             She knew. That's why she killed
             herself. But it doesn't make
             sense...

                           JOHN

             Makes sense to me.

                           ANGELA

             John, she sacrificed herself to
             beat him.
John nods.     Your point?

                           ANGELA

             Why is she in Hell?
One of those rare moments where John has no answer.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Something small and SHINY is rolling down the alley.      It
lands in the trough, spins round and round --
Beeman leans out to try and see what it is.      The silver
object keeps spinning.
He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face.      Then
another.
Book on his desk ignites in flame.




EXT. 20 LANES - NIGHT

SUV pulls into the empty parking lot. John is out before
Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door. A few
flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John
rushes in.




INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY

Only a LOW HUM pervades the dead stillness of the alley.

                             JOHN

             Beeman?
John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area.      It's
locked from the other side.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         74.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

                     (pounds on door)
             Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!
The LOW HUM fluctuates -- sounds like a BUZZING.

                           ANGELA

             Maybe he's not here.

                           JOHN

             He's always here.
Several more flies flit by him. This time John notices,
turns and spots the source of the HUM -- a cloud of FLIES
near the center aisles. Angela follows his gaze, spots
them as well.

                           ANGELA

             What?
John heads across the lanes. Swarm gets thicker and
thicker. Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth.
They approach the pin area of the center lane. The
source of the swarm is slowly revealed. In the catch
trough is a solid mound of flies.
John leans closer, spots a HAND protruding from the
mound.

                           JOHN

             Oh Jesus, no --
He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million
flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged.
Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears --

                           ANGELA

                     (stepping back)
             Oh God --
John goes ballistic, screams to the walls --

                           JOHN

             Who are you?! Answer me!!
             Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I
             summon you!
He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct
TATTOOS on his forearms. Slams them together with all
his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating --
Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                            75.





CONTINUED:

Angela steps back in awe as the air around his
outstretched arms begins to WARP -- to tear a faint hole
from the bowling alley right into another world right
here -- darker -- Hellish --

                           JOHN

             Into the light I command thee!!
             Into the light I --
John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms
separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela
just how ill he really is.
She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor.

                           JOHN

             ... this is my fault... I sent
             them in... I sent them right to
             their deaths... a damn one-man
             plague.

                           ANGELA

             John, you need a doctor.

                           JOHN

             I've seen a goddamn doctor!!
Angela glares at him -- understands now.       He's dying.
John stands, almost stumbles.       Angela tries to help.

                           JOHN

             Get away from me!!

                           ANGELA

             John?

                           JOHN

             Stay the hell away --
                     (tortured look to her)
             Please --
He uses the handrail to walk away. Angela stands there,
confused by her own emotions. She turns back to the
carnage, hears the distant SIRENS.




INT./EXT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John sits in his opened window, simmering. He holds a
lit cigarette but doesn't dare put it to his lips.
Outside the city goes about its unending churn.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         76.





CONTINUED:

Down on the street are several police vehicles. ENGINES
START and they drive away. Swirl of blue and red lights
flash across John's moist eyes.

                           ANGELA (O.S.)

             There were no trees in our back
             yard.
John finds Angela across the room in his doorway.

                           ANGELA

             But you knew that already, didn't
             you?
John meets her eyes.     Sees the questions piling up.

                           ANGELA

                     (walking towards him)
             You see something in me...
             Something Isabel had.

                           JOHN

             Go home, Angela.

                           ANGELA

             I need to understand --
John just shakes his head.

                           ANGELA

             Why not?

                           JOHN

             Because you open up to that world,
             you're inviting whatever's out
             there back in. That's what
             happened to Isabel.

                           ANGELA

             I'm not Isabel.

                           JOHN

             No, she embraced her gift while
             you denied yours and that denial
             is exactly why you're still alive.
             Stick with me, that'll change.
John gets off the window, starts walking away.

                           JOHN

             And I don't need another ghost
             following me around.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           77.





CONTINUED:


                           ANGELA

             Dammit, John -- they killed my
             sister!
That stops him cold.

                           ANGELA

             I can't let them get away with
             that. Even if it means going down
             the same path she did. Now if you
             won't help me get there, I'll find
             my own way. But I won't run.
             Never.
The two stand there -- locked in this moment.

                             ANGELA

             Please...
John can't believe this day -- looks her dead in the eye.

                           JOHN

             You do this, there's no turning
             back. You see them -- they see
             you. Understand?
Angela never blinks as she nods in agreement.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Pushing slowly through a lifeless apartment -- drawing
closer to the opened bathroom door. WATER is pouring.

                            ANGELA (O.S.)

             Do I take off my clothes or leave
             them on?
                      (a beat)
             John?

                             JOHN (O.S.)

             I'm thinking.

                             ANGELA (O.S.)

             John.

                             JOHN (O.S.)

             On is fine.




INT. BATHROOM

John fills a 70-year-old porcelain BATHTUB.       Angela
stands in the center.

                             ANGELA

             Why water?

                           JOHN

             It's the universal conduit.
             Lubricates the transition from one
             plane to another. Now ask me if
             there's water in Hell.
John turns off the faucet.

                             JOHN

             Sit.
Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself.
When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck.

                           JOHN

             Normally only a portion of the
             body has to be suspended but you
             wanted the crash course...

                           ANGELA

                     (teeth chattering)
             What will I see?
His eyes say it all.      Enough.

                             JOHN

             Lie down.

                           ANGELA

                     (gesturing the depth)
             Lie down?

                           JOHN

             You have to be fully submerged.

                             ANGELA

             For how long?

                           JOHN

             As long as it takes.     Here --
John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above
the water as she lowers down. Her breathing is picking
up. John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her.

                            JOHN

             Last chance...
                     (off her look)
             Take a deep one.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          79.





CONTINUED:

Angela takes a deep breath, holds it. John pulls his
hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted
on his the entire time.




ANGELA'S POV

A silent John ripples above.     His hand grips her arm,
skin to skin.




BACK TO SCENE

Angela lies there and panic sets in. She starts to
surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom,
holds it firm. Her eyes dart about. Air is running out.
She can't hold her breath much longer. It's not
working --
But the room's lighting begins to pulsate -- as if the
current were ramping down. It slows to that dim half-
light as --
JOHN'S EYES -- CLOSE.     A single blink.
ANGELA is lying in now BOILING WATER, screaming for all
of her life. Water muffles the sound but not the fury.
Huge TUB SHUDDERS hard -- snapping out of the hold down
bolts. John is stunned -- how powerful is this woman?
Another SCREAM and the inch-thick TUB CRACKS.     Water
starts streaming onto the tile.
John lunges, grabs Angela and PULLS her up from the
water -- her muffled SCREAMS SHATTERING the air as her
mouth breaks the surface. She SLAMS hard against his
chest -- arms wrapping tight -- fingers digging into his
back -- leaving marks that might just scar.
TUB GIVES WAY and the damn breaks. John and Angela go
down -- hit the tile as one -- water washing over them
both.
ANGELA lies there on top of John. Trembling.      She looks
up him, eyes filled with revelation.

                           ANGELA

             All those people... so sad...
John nods, helping her understand.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                       80.

             ... I've always known... where the
             bad guys are... where to aim, when
             to duck... it's not luck... I've
             always known...
Tears stream down her cheeks. John reaches out to touch
her when her eyes CLAMP TIGHT in pain --

                           JOHN

             Angela?
Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out.
John pries himself from the tile, goes after her.




INT. BEHIND THE ALLEY

Angela runs behind the vertebrae of machines, dripping
water the entire way. John tries to keep up.

                           ANGELA

             It was rolling toward him -- not a
             ball -- something smaller. Shiny.
She stops, kneels to the floor.     John walks up to join her.
Something glints in the catch trough. She reaches down,
plucks it up and brings an odd COIN INTO VIEW --
John's face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar
coin.

                           JOHN

             Balthazar.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Beeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are
dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and bullets go
everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets.
Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also.




CHRISTIAN RELICS

are removed from a display cabinet.
There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the
petrified husk from the River of Life -- the hollow shaft
of an iron cross -- all striking pieces individually but
when twisted and locked together form a very imposing --

-- HOLY SHOTGUN.

He swings the cross down, pours a pound of blasting
powder into the husk -- chambers a special bullet into
one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut -- turns and FIRES.
BULLET leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his
endless apartment, blasts the center out of --
A carton of Lucky Strikes.
SETTLE ON the Surgeon General's warning -- burning away.

                           ANGELA (V.O.)

             Can you kill him? What about the
             Balance?




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

John is stuffing the bowling bag while Angela watches,
now dressed in dry clothes. That shirt is John's.

                            JOHN

             That half-breed tipped my scales
             when he started killing my
             friends. I'm just adding a little
             counterweight.
John lifts that holy shotgun -- KA CHICK --

                             ANGELA

             What about me?    I can't stay here
             forever.
John turns to her -- locks on those eyes. He reaches
into his coat pocket as he walks up to her. She shudders
as his arms wrap around her face and for a beat they're
cheek to cheek. When he pulls back she sees he has
clipped Hennessey's AMULET around her neck.

                           JOHN

             Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

                             ANGELA

             So I'm going.

                           JOHN

                     (knows he can't win)
             You're staying in the car.




                                                    82.





INT./EXT. 20 LANES - DAWN

FAT-ASS TIRES BURN under the full torque of a 426 HEMI.
A jet-black '70s BARRACUDA BLASTS from the basement
garage of 20 Lanes -- slides onto the streets of L.A.
Angela hangs on as John grabs the SKULL shifter knob --
slams into 2nd -- leaves another layer of tread behind.




EXT. OCEAN

FLYING OVER the ocean, a 747 ROARS RIGHT OVER US.
Dipping out of cloud cover, it reveals the coast of a
sprawling metropolis stretched out miles below.




L.A. LANDMARKS - DAWN

streak PAST. The Big Donut, the occult bookstores, the
'57 Chevy sign, that Mission in the park.
This is actually the POV FROM John's Barracuda.
He downshifts -- DRIFTS PAST a building with a facade of
pre-stressed concrete and huge gold letters -- "BZR

FINANCE AND BROKERAGE."


                           JOHN (O.S.)

             This shouldn't take long.




INT. BZR BROKERAGE

Elevator opens and John steps out into a lobby of
concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams money.
Lots of it.
Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is
practically empty.
Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open. John
looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick
DOOR glides closed, seals with another HISS. No way in.
John notices the janitor down one hallway. It's Nico
from Midnite's. He and John lock stares. Nico opens a
"Security Only" door, steps inside -- leaves the door
open.




INT. TRADING ROOM

Monitors are powering up around the room. A few of those
Young Businessmen we last saw at Midnite's are here.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                           YOUNG TURK

                     (into phone)
             Hey, early bird is a fat bird,
             know what I'm sayin'?
Balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug
and successful businessman he is. He stops at a LONG
MIRROR on one wall. Adjusts his collar, his hair. His
"look."

                           PRETTY BOY

             What are we pushing today, sir?

                           BALTHAZAR

             Phillip Morris.
As Balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts
slightly. The demon in him? He touches his face, does a
vowel stretch. His face distorts even further.
That's got him moving closer to the mirror.
Balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears
in motion, rippling as if liquefied. And just when he
sees the surface of the mirror BLISTERING and starts to
move --

BOOOM --

One way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a
FIREBALL -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and
flame.
John stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL --
that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his
holy shotgun.

                           JOHN

             How's he doing it?
John steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising
from the floor. Suit's in shreds, half his face is
burned off, but now he's pissed.

                           BALTHAZAR

             This is in direct violation of the
             Balance!

                           JOHN

             Screw the Balance.
John hits him with another BLAST of FLAME -- pins him
hard against the wall.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       84.





CONTINUED:

Balthazar's young turks attack. One leaps over the
trading station. John swings around -- aims the SHOTGUN
-- BOOM -- half-breed is blasted midair.
The other turk seems to defy gravity as he scampers
across the ceiling. John aims up -- PUMPS SEVERAL ROUNDS
-- steps out of the way as a body falls, smashes into a
desk. BOOM -- BOOM -- that'll keep it down.




INT. BARRACUDA

Angela hears the GUNSHOTS. Cop instinct takes over and
she gets out of the car. Checks the amulet. Intact.




INT. BZR TRADING ROOM

John turns his attention back to Balthazar, doesn't
hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame.
Suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else
underneath. The true form.

                           JOHN

             How's he doing it, you half-breed
             shit?!
John swings the flame aside so he can KICK Balthazar
against the wall. But now his WEAPON SPUTTERS. Shit.
Charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and
grabs John by the throat.
Balthazar rises from the ashes.     He may be burned, but
he's one tough son of a bitch.
Balthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck. John can't
break his hold.     He's choking, frantically rummages
through his coat    pockets. Comes out with those sacred
GOLD KNUCKLES on    his right hand.
Balthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him
across the face. The enhanced punch sends a dizzying
ripple throughout Balthazar's body.
But he doesn't let go. John is choking, starts whaling
on him. Again and again -- each punch weakening this
demon more.
John finally gets him against the wall. Right arm's
tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand,
and with extreme pleasure -- continues punching away.
Drives Balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of
death.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         85.





CONTINUED:

He leans up, winded. Watches in delight as Balthazar
strains to take his final breaths.

                           BALTHAZAR

             I will see you very soon...

                           JOHN

             Not really, no.

                           BALTHAZAR

             You can't cheat it this time...
             you're going back to Hell.

                            JOHN

             True.   But you're not.
John removes that small BLACK BOX from his coat.
Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches
it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses --
A Bible.

                           BALTHAZAR

             What are you doing?

                           JOHN

             I'm reading you your last rites.
Balthazar reacts.      This isn't good.

                           BALTHAZAR

             Your remedial incantations have no
             relevance to my kind.

                           JOHN

             Aren't you half human?
Balthazar doesn't have to answer.

                           JOHN

             You see, that makes you eligible
             to be forgiven. You do know what
             it is to truly be forgiven? To be
             welcomed into the kingdom of God?
Balthazar's worst nightmare.

                           JOHN

             A demon in heaven -- love to be a
             fly on that wall...

                           BALTHAZAR

             You're not a priest, you have no
             power...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       86.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             -- I escaped hell, who else do you
             know that has the power to do
             that?!
Balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs.

                           JOHN

             Just tell me how Mammon is
             crossing over and you can go back
             to your shithole.
Balthazar isn't convinced.
John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read --

                           JOHN

             'May the merciful God have mercy
             on you and grant you the pardon of
             all your sins...'
He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead. Balthazar
glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding
authority.

                           JOHN

             'Whosoever sins you remit on earth
             they are remitted unto them in
             heaven. I absolve you from -- '

                           BALTHAZAR

             -- It may not even work...

                            JOHN

             How?   How's he doing it?!
Balthazar looks scared as shit to tell him.

                           JOHN

                     (bellowing out)
             'Grant your child entry into thy
             kingdom in the name of the Father,
             and the Son and the Holy Gh -- '

                           BALTHAZAR

             ... Sangre de dio.
John is stunned -- did he hear right?     Balthazar nods.

                            JOHN

             How?

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                        87.





CONTINUED:


                           BALTHAZAR

             What killed the Son of God will
             give birth to the son of the
             devil.
John's mind races and he finally puts it together.

                           JOHN

             He's found the Spear.
Balthazar's expression confirms it.

INT. 747 - MID-FLIGHT

Prisoner in an aisle seat, trying to keep calm. He looks
behind him as if being watched. Just nerves again.

EXT. BZR BROKERAGE - FRONT AREA

ANGELA moves through the gathered crowd looking up at the
building. As she makes her way through, the amulet
brushes against bodies -- swinging from side to side.
Angela suddenly stops in the center of the street,
turns...

                           ANGELA

             Something's coming...
She stares at her surroundings with an increasing sense
of dread. Then hears the RUMBLE and TIRES SCREECHING.

                                               (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Angela spins, spots John's BARRACUDA exploding around the
corner. It barrels up the street and slides to a
SQUEALING stop in front of her. Passenger door swings
open.

                           JOHN

             What happened to staying in the
             car?

                           ANGELA

             You were in danger.

                           JOHN

             Well now there's a premonition.
SIRENS crack the air.     Angela jumps in and John PEELS

OUT.





INT. BZR

Balthazar is taking his last breaths when the sound of
WIND filters through the room. He looks up as a shadow
drapes across him. Eyes widen.

                           BALTHAZAR

             One more chance...
Shadow darkens and his decimated form shudders.

                           JOHN (V.O.)

             Jesus didn't die from being nailed
             to a cross.




EXT./INT. BARRACUDA - MOVING

John takes a turn at 70 as Angela stares into John's
Bible.

                           JOHN

             He was finished off by a soldier's
             spear.
He points in the Bible at a detailed painting of the
event -- Jesus hanging on the cross -- being pierced by a
soldier's spear. It matches that child's drawing John
removed from the fridge -- now lying on his seat.

                           ANGELA

             I'm Catholic, John -- I know the
             crucifixion story.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                           89.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             Then you know what this spear
             would mean to a demon trying to
             cross over.
She doesn't.

                           JOHN

             The stains on its edges?
Angela looks back at the painting, notes the liquid
flowing from Jesus' wound. Angela can't believe it --

                           JOHN

             Mammon needed divine assistance --
             how's the blood of God's only son?
Angela sits stunned for a moment.

                           ANGELA

             So that's it -- he's got
             everything he needs to escape...

                           JOHN

             Not quite.
                     (glances at her)
             Twins.
Angela gives him a look.       Something in the rearview
mirror catches his gaze.

                             JOHN

             Here we go --
John floors it and Angela glances out the back window,
spots something in the traffic -- bounding over vehicles,
hitting the pavement on all fours --

                             ANGELA

             What is that?

                           JOHN

             A hound on the hunt.
A blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible
speed -- denting in roofs, CRACKING a WINDSHIELD --
causing general chaos. Cars brake -- SLIDE into each
other. And still this thing keeps coming.

                             JOHN

             Hang on --
BARRACUDA slides into an alley, races toward the other
end.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        90.





CONTINUED:

Angela looks back, sees their pursuer enter the alley.
It makes huge strides along the walls, defying all manner
of physics.

                            ANGELA

             Impossible.
The beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the
building.

                            ANGELA

             I lost it.
BAM, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good
foot.
A huge clawed TALON punches into the sheet metal, starts
shredding it right over Angela. Talon thrusts in.
Angela dodges it -- her amulet swinging wildly.
John HITS the BRAKES and the beast flips off the roof and
onto the hood -- right INTO VIEW.
A muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably
Balthazar's. He lashes against the windshield with an
extra appendage. Thank God for safety glass.
He jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire
windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood. GLASS
PARTICLES EXPLODE into the car.
John throws the car into a spin, slamming the Barracuda
into several parked cars. Balthazar is uprooted, is
thrown from the car.
Angela looks back, sees Balthazar rolling into traffic.

                            ANGELA

             He's down --

                            JOHN

             He's not down.   Gimme your phone.
Angela pulls out her cellular.

                           CHAZ

                     (remembering)
             Oh no, no, no, not that, I just
             paid off this car!

                            JOHN

             West side of the 3rd Street
             Bridge, say...
He checks the speedometer -- 90 mph.

                           JOHN

             ... 2 minutes.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           CHAZ

             I'm five blocks away!
                     (as John CLICKS off)
             John? John?! Ah... shit.
Chaz downshifts, stops in cloud of dust --

                           CHAZ

             Sorry, tour's over.
The British start to argue.

                           CHAZ


             OUT YA WANKERS!!! NOW!!





EXT. LA STREETS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

John heads toward the skyline now -- at 90 mph -- to the
3rd Street Bridge on the horizon.
Angela scans behind them, can't believe her eyes.

                           ANGELA

             He's back.
Here comes Balthazar through traffic on all fours --

                           ANGELA

             John, he's back and he's gaining!

                           JOHN

             Of course he's gaining.
John PUNCHES the GAS to the floor.




EXT. 3RD STREET BRIDGE

Chaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge.
He SCREECHES TO A STOP across the roadway -- opens the
glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a
glass vial out of it.
Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid. Chaz jumps
out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears
the sound of a STRAINING ENGINE.
Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge's arched
roadway. And what the hell is that running behind it?

                           CHAZ

             Shit -- shit -- shit --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                       93.





CONTINUED:

Chaz twists off the gas cap, drops the vial into the tank.
He pulls out his BEEPER, rips the cover off, exposing the
electronics.
He wedges the beeper into the tank inlet, then starts
sprinting off the bridge while --




INT. BARRACUDA

John gives Angela the number.

                           JOHN


             9... 5... 4...

Taxi in view.     Angela punches in the number --

                           ANGELA


             9-5-4...

They RIP past the taxi --

                           JOHN


             6... 6... 6

Here comes Balthazar up the bridge. Like a supercharged
cheetah, running full stride. And not even winded.

                           ANGELA


             6... 6... 6

Balthazar is almost to the taxi -- John waits -- then --

                           JOHN


             6.

Angela punches the last digit as --
-- Balthazar LEAPS to jump the taxi --




INT. GAS TANK

BEEPER CONTACTS BUZZ -- spark -- GAS IGNITES --




TAXI

EXPLODES right under Balthazar in a tremendous FIREBALL.
Initial impact only kicks him higher. It's when the
Sedrallus in the tank truly ignites that the real
FIREWORKS begin.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                     94.





CONTINUED:

Balthazar is caught in a haze of brilliant red particles
that tear his body apart in midair. His final SHRIEK is
chilling.




EXT./INT. BARRACUDA

John smacks the wheel, victoriously -- looks over to
Angela who sighs with relief. His expression changes as
he centers on the empty necklace dangling around her
neck.

                           JOHN

             Where's the amulet?
WHAM -- something reaches through the roof hole and JERKS
HER right out of the car.

                           JOHN


             ANGELA!!

John SLAMS the BRAKES home -- car spins and John is
already jumping out before it comes to a stop. He runs
to the rail.

                           CHAZ

                     (running up)
             What the hell was that?!
Both leap onto the concrete rail, lean over and spot a
HUGE WINGED SHADOW just as it disappears below the
bridge.
Chaz is speechless as he turns to John. This is too
much. John gives him the out he's been waiting for --

                           JOHN

             We're even.
Chaz nods and John leaves him at the rail.   He jumps back
in the BARRACUDA and PEELS OUT.
Chaz watches him race away, looks back at his burning
taxi.

                           CHAZ

             Even?




EXT. LAX - DAY

Prisoner walks out of the terminal, here at last. He
stares at all the vehicles at his disposal. A family
crowds around the back of a minivan. Wife hugs the dad.




                                                      95.





MYSTERIOUS POV

Watches him from behind.    Prisoner turns, looks back,
suspiciously. Nothing.




PRISONER

walks out to the street, slides into the minivan, tears
away. Kids' toys tumble across the seats.




INT. CLUB MIDNITE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

John bursts through a door -- Midnite right on his heels.

                         MIDNITE

           Mammon has been trying to climb
           out of his father's shadow for
           eons.

                         JOHN

           And this time he might just make
           it.

                         MIDNITE

                   (unconvinced)
           Because he's got the Spear?

                         JOHN

           And the bridge.

                         MIDNITE

           You're giving this girl way too
           much credit.

                         JOHN

           You don't know her.

                          MIDNITE

           And you do?   That would be a
           first.
John swings open a STORAGE ROOM DOOR -- looks in at
large-scale relics -- statues, props, etc.

                         JOHN

           Where's the chair?

                         MIDNITE

           The chair?

                         JOHN

           The delicate little number from
           Sing Sing?

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         96.





CONTINUED:

Midnite just stares at him.

                           MIDNITE

             It's a fine line that separates a
             hero from a fool.

                           JOHN

             I'll take my chances.

                           MIDNITE

             And taint my establishment with
             your blood? I don't think so.

                           JOHN

             Midnite --

                           MIDNITE

             You know what that device can do
             to the ill-equipped --

                           JOHN

             Midnite --

                           MIDNITE

             -- and even in your most glorious
             days your brain was never your
             most powerful attribute --

                           JOHN

             Where the hell is the chair, you
             dumb shit?!
Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's
seven feet. John knows he went too far.

                           JOHN

             That was the cancer talking, you
             know that, right?

                           MIDNITE

                     (holds up his finger)
             Once.
John nods.




INT. STORAGE AREA

Fluorescents flicker, REVEAL boxes of toilet tissue,
cooking supplies, etc. And sitting in one corner by the
huge power transformer is --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          97.





CONTINUED:

-- the chair. Heavy wooden monstrosity with straps and
cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last
time. Yeah, it's an electric chair right out of Sing
Sing.

                           JOHN

             What's in your bathroom, a Renoir?

                           MIDNITE

             I have insurance issues.
John clears off the seat, starts to sit.        Midnite blocks
him.

                           MIDNITE

             You haven't surfed in decades.

                           JOHN

             Like riding a bike...
He tries again.     Midnite blocks him again.

                           MIDNITE

             You'll be lucky to reach an
             elemental plane.

                           JOHN

             Then just increase the juice.
John tries again.     Again Midnite stops him.

                           MIDNITE

             In your condition your body won't
             take much.

                           JOHN

             I just need enough rope to find
             her.

                           MIDNITE

             And if you do -- what then?

                           JOHN

             One goddamn problem at a time --
John shoves past him, plops his ass in the huge chair.
His feet dangle off the ground. Midnite stands by, won't
help. So John starts strapping himself in the chair.
His chest, his ankles. One wrist. He obviously can't
strap the other. He looks to the big man.

                           JOHN

             You want me to sign a waiver?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        98.





CONTINUED:

Midnite sighs -- finally straps the other wrist in --
pulls it TIGHT. Ouch.

                           JOHN

             Hang on, Angela.




EXT. SKY - CLOSE ON ANGELA

moving in a surreal fashion across an evening sky. Below
her the City of Angels sweep past. Her eyes drift open
and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality --




REFLECTION IN HER EYES

The city is ON FIRE. It's a repeat of Isabel's prophetic
vision before she jumped.

                           MIDNITE (V.O.)

             Listen to my voice inside...




INT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM

Midnite kneels in front of John who is now handcuffed to
the chair, cables draped from every limb.

                           MIDNITE

             I'll try and guide you out.

                           JOHN

             Try?

                           MIDNITE

             Mammon was forced out of that girl
             when she jumped so unless he found
             a holding vessel to wait in, he
             would have fallen back to Hell.

                           JOHN

             No, he's still here.   I'm sure of it.

                           MIDNITE

             Then watch yourself. He could be
             in anyone out there.
John nods. Midnite lifts a palm of INSECT WINGS in front
of his face.

                           JOHN

             Roach wings? What happened to
             using lilac pedals -- ?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           99.





CONTINUED:

Midnite cranks the JUICE on the panel as he BLOWS and John
reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind. His head slams
back against the slats. His skin ripples from the force.
STAY ON his face as the sound of POWER courses through John.

                           MIDNITE

             Peter do caelis, Deus, misere
             nobis. Fili Redemptor mundi,
             Deus, Miserere nobis...
A FLASH turns into a streak behind John's face --
stretching to infinity.

                           MIDNITE (V.O.)

             Find the possessor and the Spear
             will be revealed... find them...
             find them and follow...
The flash whips back TOWARD us and John is suddenly
somewhere else. He looks O.S.




INT. PRISON CHAMBER FROM THE OPEN

FROM that MYSTERIOUS POV, we watch the Prisoner hold the
Spear for the first time. Like before, he turns and
looks behind him where --
John now stands. Watching.      John centers on the Spear in
the Prisoner's hand.




FLASH AHEAD - INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT

That same MYSTERIOUS POV of the Prisoner in line.      He
turns as he did before and it's --
-- John behind him.     Watching.   Prisoner turns away.




FLASH AHEAD - EXT. LAX TERMINAL - EVENING

MYSTERIOUS POV is ON the Prisoner at the exit doors.        He
looks back, suspiciously, and there's -
John.   Watching.    Prisoner turns, heads to the minivan.




FLASH AHEAD - EXT. EAST L.A. - MYSTERIOUS POV - NIGHT

of a minivan still smoking from a recent impact against a
large iron ENTRANCE GATE. Prisoner is running from it,
glances back --

                                                        100.





CONTINUED:

John is there. Watches as the Prisoner enters the
abandoned wing of -- Ravenscar. John reacts. How did he
miss this?




FLASH AHEAD - INT. SLEEP ROOM

Fifty beds with fifty patients. Asleep. The Prisoner
kneels next to one of the beds. John walks over, touches
him and he rocks to the floor. Dead. Body reveals the
Spear on the blanket of the bed.
John reaches out to touch it when the boy BARRY suddenly
SITS UP from under the blanket and grabs him by the
throat. NOTE the boy's BLACKENED FINGERNAILS.
John struggles to pull him off but the boy's grip is
locked tight. John grabs at his hands -- chokes out the
name --

                          JOHN


             MIDNITE!!

John's hands suddenly become MIDNITE'S as his ally pulls
him back into --




INT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM

John's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of
Midnite's grip. John gasps as he comes back -- nods to
Midnite and finally --

                           JOHN

             Ravenscar. The abandoned wing.
             He's in the boy.




EXT. OVER HILLSIDE - FLYING - EVENING

WINGED SHADOW glides across the landscape, sweeps across
manicured grounds and rises to reveal Ravenscar Hospital.




INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE - LATER

Midnite piles ASSAULT RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a
table.

                           MIDNITE

             You know these won't kill them.
John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan.

                                               (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                           MIDNITE

             You probably won't even get close
             enough to use them.
In the pan is that RELIGIOUS RELIC he brought from India.
It's now MELTING. Midnite has trouble watching it
dissolve.

                           MIDNITE

             And it's not just the boy.
John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small
casting blocks.

                           MIDNITE

             You better worry about whoever's
             helping him.
John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings
into a pot of water -- HISSSSSS.

                           MIDNITE

             As much as I admire your blind
             faith even in the most dire
             situations -- expecting to just
             waltz into a facility that is
             about to become the floodgate of
             Hell is reaching a bit, even for
             you.
John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just
knows what he's thinking. Midnite sighs, heavily.

                           MIDNITE

             Well I suppose two fools can die
             just as easily as one.
John almost smiles.

                           MIDNITE

             Hey, you think I'm trusting you to
             save the world?
John taps the casting and out falls a GOLD-TIPPED BULLET.

                           MIDNITE

             But we're going to need more than
             a few magic bullets to get inside.
John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around
the room. Just like John's. Hmmmm...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       102.

                           JOHN

             That ritual you do with the water,
             can you do more than one bottle at
             a time?
Midnite raises an eyebrow.




EXT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT

The motorized MAIN GATE is jammed -- opening and closing
on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner carjacked. The
abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit
night. Vague figures move about near the emergency
entrance.
John's BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John
stares out, points up to the WATER TANK -- on the roof.

                              MIDNITE

             Figures.




INT. RAVENSCAR - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Therapy machines look like medieval torture devices in
the dimly-lit room. BARRY stands waist deep in a large
hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor. His skin is
pale, sickly looking. Obviously containing Mammon takes
its toll. Especially on a child.
His hands are below his waist and now we see they're
lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water. Her
face floats just above the surface as he buckles
restraining straps around her wrists.




INT. RAVENSCAR - ABANDONED WING

Front glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly
strut inside. Stop.
HEAR the O.S. MURMURS of an unseen crowd.
This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people. Lawyers.
Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc... Most are
crowded in front of a set of double doors.
Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys.
John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot
cop.

                           JOHN

             Okay -- let's cut the scratch and
             call it a night. Meeting's over.
That's got their attention. As entertainment. A few
chuckle. John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from
the crowd. Still that bundle of sexual energy.

                           JOHN

             Ellie?

                           ELLIE

             Oh, John, you know how much I love
             it on this side. This was just an
             opportunity to make it permanent.

                           JOHN

             You think his son will be any
             different? He'll just turn this
             place into his own Hell and then
             where will you to party, Heaven?

                           ELLIE

             No need to get nasty.

                           JOHN

             Never bothered you before.

                           ELLIE

             I am so going to miss our little
             trysts.
Ellie steps closer.     The crowd starts to close in with
her.

                           JOHN

             I'm sure you will.
John pulls out his lighter, holds it up -- flicks it on.

                           JOHN

             Now turn around and take your
             friends with you.
Can he look more ridiculous?

                           JOHN

             I will deport you.   All of you.
             You know I can.
John steps back up onto a chair, thrusts the lighter
higher --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        104.





CONTINUED:


                           ELLIE

             Oh, John, this is embarrassing.
             Where is your pride?
-- right under a SPRINKLER HEAD.

                           JOHN

             Go to Hell.
Ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger.




SERIES OF SHOTS

Ellie and a room of half-humans -- all looking up as
water sprays from every nozzle. John and Midnite tense
because the first drops have no effect. A beat -- a
SPURT in the waterlines and suddenly -- SHRIEKS fill the
room as half human skin begins to FRY.

                           ELLIE

             Holy water!
Emergency lighting has snapped on -- throwing the room
into a strobing nightmare of action. Flashes of human
skin melting, revealing snippets of the true demons
underneath. It's total pandemonium as their rage is
directed toward the only real humans in the room.
John and Midnite fling their coats open -- draw their
WEAPONS and starts FIRING away at the attacking horde.
Sacred bullets cause major damage -- wounds that ripple
out through demon bodies.
John and Midnite slam back to back -- spinning under the
protective shield of a showering sprinkler head --
shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture
into the COLUMN OF SPRAY.
One reloads while the other FIRES. It's a hellish form
of a turkey shoot. Nothing sacred, nothing spared.
John goes for the double doors. Midnite covers him --
blows away another two disintegrating demons. Two come
up behind and he spins, takes them down.
JOHN gets to the doors, starts to open them when Ellie
jumps onto his back -- nails digging in.

                           ELLIE

             I'm not going back there!

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      105.





CONTINUED:


                           JOHN

             We are what we are, Ellie --
John FIRES over his back, loosens her grip. He grabs
hold, shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead
sprinkler head. Legs flail about.
Midnite comes out of the rain -- grabs John.

                           MIDNITE

             Let's go.
John drops Ellie to the floor. No more pretty face -- no
face at all -- yet the screams still come.
John and Midnite get to the doors -- shove through.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Angela's body and face are completely submerged now. She
comes to, sees Barry above her -- tries to rise but the
boy pushes her head to the bottom, holds it there. Last
bubbles are floating up from her mouth. Barry places his
other hand on her arm, closes his eyes.




INT. CORRIDOR

Holy rain has stopped in here. A fine mist floats in the
air. John and Midnite make their way through. Only
their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence.
Another set of doors is ahead. Before they reach it a
faint shadow crosses in the mist. Both pause, expecting
something to reveal itself. But it doesn't.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Faint waves undulate Barry's skin -- ripple from his
chest, down his arms and into a submerged Angela. Every
muscle in her body tenses in stark relief.




ANGELA'S POV

Barry's image ripples above her in silence. Room
lighting starts to pulse -- slower and slower and when
it's caught in that dim half-light -- Angela JOLTS and
this time we CROSS OVER INTO --




                                                        106.





PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM HELL

Angela is lying in a bone-dry tank, lifts her head up to
see a room not much different than the one she just left.
Except for the SOUND. That low DRONE RISING IN PITCH --
those DEMONIC SCREECHES scratching at the walls.
And now those INKY splotches begin consuming the color
and light from the walls. Moving in on Angela. Closer
and closer -- whatever's coming is just about on her.

                         MAMMON (O.S.)

          Angela.
Angela SPINS and for a split second comes face to face
with the hideous form of MAMMON. She SCREAMS.




INT. NORMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - REAL TIME

John and Midnite burst into the room, spot Barry standing
in the tank. His hands in the water. On Angela.

                          JOHN

                    (rushing toward him)
          Barry!
Barry looks up, sees the two men rushing toward him.
Guns aimed.

                         JOHN

          Let her up!!   Let her up!!
A beat as John meets Barry's eyes -- realizes he's
staring at a frightened child. Barry backs away as --
-- Angela sits up behind John.    Water rippling off,
straps dangling free.
John turns -- locks on her BLACK EYES.

                         JOHN

          Shit --
John thinks fast -- scans the area and sees every mirror
in the room has been shattered. So much for the quick
fix.
He jumps into the water with her, grabs her face and
pushes her against the tank walls. This is an exorcism
on the fly.

                        JOHN

          Amar natash bow basar! Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                         107.





CONTINUED:

Angela's eyes snap open -- dark and dilated. John sees
it -- clasps a hand over her mouth -- cutting off her air
supply.

                           JOHN

             Back to Hell, asshole --
Her body undulates as Mammon's shape tries to come through.
Pulsating through her arms, her chest -- her face.
Angela BITES into his palm. John recoils. She shoves
him off and John hits the tile hard. Angela jumps from
the tank, pushes past in a blur. John spins to see
Midnite standing right there -- Angela now firmly in his
size-twelve grasp.

                           MIDNITE

                     (to John)
             Finish it.

INTERCUT WITH:





MYSTERIOUS HIGH POV

John coughs, struggles to stand. He tries to cover but
it's obvious his end is nearing. Midnite positions
Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides --
crucifixion-style. She tries but can't break free. John
puts a hand to her forehead --

                           JOHN

             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes.

                           JOHN/MIDNITE

             Rescind from the flesh I command
             thee -- Amar natash bow basar!
Angela's body stops fighting. The darkness in her eyes
and fingernails begins to fade. It's working...
Midnite is suddenly JERKED backwards with an agonizing
YELL. Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness.
John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is
lifted right off the floor by an INVISIBLE GRASP, slammed
into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible
force against the floor.
Midnite glares at John, tries to speak.     But the words
die on his lips.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          108.





CONTINUED:

Enraged, John scans the empty room, sees a large SHADOW
on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object.
He holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves
and slams those tattoos together --

                           JOHN

             Into the light I command thee!
             Into the light I command thee!
It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this
spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion
the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes
that familiar shape of WINGS.

                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)

             Your ego is astounding.
John strains to see the shadow become the real thing --
the majestic wings of an angel.

                           JOHN

             Gabriel?
John is too weak to even be surprised anymore.

                           JOHN

             Figures...
Gabriel touches down in front of him.       Spear in his hand.

                           JOHN

             And the wicked shall inherit the
             Earth.

                           GABRIEL

             You presume to judge me, John.

                            JOHN

             Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call
             me provincial.

                           GABRIEL

             I am seeking to inspire humankind
             to be all that was intended.

                           JOHN

             By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good
             thinking...
Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                           GABRIEL

             You've had it too easy for too
             long.

                           JOHN

             So what's a few thousand years of
             pain, right?

                           GABRIEL

             You never deserved to be blessed.
             You've all been born with a silver
             spoon in your mouth, never really
             appreciating the gift you were
             given so freely -- unconditional
             love from your creator.

                           JOHN

             And that just bugs the shit out of
             you.

                           GABRIEL

             It's not your fault. Like the
             animals you are, you never learn
             unless sufficiently prodded.
             Pleasure has no lasting effect.
             But subject you to pain,
             unpleasantness -- suffering -- and
             you will take notice, you will
             fight to overcome, to earn your
             redemption. That is when you're
             at your best.
Angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again.

                           JOHN

             You're trying to teach us a
             lesson?

                           GABRIEL

             No, I'm giving you the chance to
             rise above the suffering and truly
             earn the love of God.
                     (a beat)
             The road to salvation begins
             tonight. Right now.
John just stares at this rogue angel, centers on the
Spear in his hand. He makes a break for it. Gabriel's
wings beat once.
The GUST BLOWS John through the double doors, back into
the --




                                                       110.





CORRIDOR

-- where he smashes against a mesh-screened window, drops
to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

Gabriel turns back to Angela. He approaches her -- his
rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her --
pulling her in. Those eyes of his could melt Dracula.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

can't even stand, let alone save the girl.     Or humanity.
It would be so easy to give up. To roll over and die.
But instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long
time.

                         JOHN

                   (whispering)
           ... I know I'm not one of your
           favorites... I'm not even allowed
           in your house these days... but I
           could use a little attention...
John waits for nothing. His body crumples, his cheek
landing flat against the tile.
Glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him. As he
stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S EYES

begin to quiver.   The color drains.    Blackness is waiting.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

slides his back up the wall as he reels in that shard of
mirror.




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S

posture begins to change. Mammon's form ripples through
her -- starts to push out through her skin. Gabriel
stands behind her, his wings cocooned around her waist.

                         GABRIEL

                   (whispering to her)
           Cross the bridge to your destiny...




                                                     111.





CORRIDOR - JOHN

pulls up his sleeve, exposes his old scar. He pauses a
beat, closes his eyes. STAY ON his face as he makes one
swift SLICE movement.
But he's in a rush here -- makes that same motion across
his other wrist as well.
With both wrists purging his life away, John settles back
into the corner and waits for the inevitable.

                          JOHN

            Hurry...




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - GABRIEL

reveals the Spear.




CORRIDOR - JOHN

is dying.    Eyes are starting to close as...




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - GABRIEL

Raises the Spear over Angela's chest.
HEAR the SOUNDS of a million DEMONS inside of her ready
to break free --
He holds the Spear high above her chest -- readies for
the final thrust as --




CORRIDOR

Bulbs flicker as current ramps down and TIME COMES TO A

COMPLETE STOP.

All we're left with is a distant METALLIC DRONE, like the
reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago.
John lies in that dim half-light.    Motionless.
Something starts to swirl near him and just like that,
John is no longer alone. Shadow falls over his pathetic
form.

                          SATAN (O.S.)

            The time has come at last to
            collect your soul.

John pries his eyes open...

             Hello, John.

                             JOHN

             You're early.

                           SATAN

             You're the one show I wouldn't
             miss.

                             JOHN

             So I've heard.
Satan sees John's slit wrists.

                            SATAN

             I didn't think you'd make the same
             mistake twice.
John looks up at him.

                           SATAN

             You didn't, did you?

                           JOHN

             ... so how's your son?

                           SATAN

             And why would that matter to you?

                           JOHN

             ... he's topside...

                             SATAN

             I know.

                             JOHN

             With Gabriel.

                             SATAN

             Your point?

                           JOHN

             He's helping your son create his
             own Hell on Earth...

                           SATAN

             Well, boys will be boys...

                           JOHN

             He has the Spear of Destiny.

Satan didn't know that.     Now he's concerned.     He studies
this dying man.

             This is another one of your cons.

                           JOHN

             Go look for yourself...
Satan is still suspicious.

                           JOHN

             You've waited twenty years for me,
             what's another twenty seconds?
Satan contemplates his remark. Metallic reverberation is
overtaken as SOUND and MOTION ramp back to real time --




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - THE SPEAR

is about to be thrust into Angela's chest.

                           SATAN (O.S.)

             Gabriel?
Gabriel looks up -- spots him in the room. Gabriel
reacts -- pulls the spear toward her with all his
might -- but Satan is faster -- Angela vanishes and
Gabriel has now pierced dead air.
Satan holds Angela tight -- covering her mouth like John
did. She struggles and the demon inside appears --
reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on
the floor. Hideous. The real MAMMON.

                           SATAN

             Say goodbye to the sun -- both of
             you.
Mammon SHRIEKS and Gabriel's beautiful wings ignite in

FLAME --


                           GABRIEL

             No!!!!!!!!




CORRIDOR - JOHN

is rocked by a major jolt that shakes the entire building
to its foundation. A moment later --

                                                    114.





CONTINUED:

Satan is back. John looks up, gives him that look -- you
owe me. Satan hates admitting it but knows it's true.

                           SATAN

             So... what do you want?   An
             extension?
John shakes his head, can barely utter a sound...

                           JOHN

             Isabel...

                           SATAN

             What about her?

                           JOHN

             ... let her... go home...

                           SATAN

             You would give up your life so she
             could go to Heaven?
John manages a nod...

                           SATAN

             Fine.
                     (closes, opens eyes)
             It's done.




INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

ANGELA gasps -- her first real breath's a strain.
Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her
eyes --




EXT. THAT GORGEOUS SKY

Stretches out BEFORE us. And here come those two swings,
penduluming up in SLOW MOTION.
Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again. But
this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing.
Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for
what seems so close... so close...
Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky.

                           SATAN (V.O.)

             Time to go.




                                                       115.





INT. CORRIDOR

John relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable. Satan takes
his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds
himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. Try
as he might, he can't budge John an inch.
And now John's other hand leaves his side, and as if
weightless, begins to rise toward something above.
No sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the
embrace of God.
Satan sees this and recoils in absolute RAGE --

                        SATAN

          The sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE

          BELONGS TO ME!!

John's rising hand drifts back down in front of Satan,
the middle finger fully extended. Final straw.
Satan goes rabid -- turns to PURE ENERGY for a split
second. His hands remain on fire.

                        SATAN

          You will live, John Constantine,
          you will live so you'll have the
          chance to prove that your soul
          truly belongs in Hell. You will
          live!
Satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into John's
body --
John screams in agony. Satan tears through his tissue --
collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of
diseased tissue with one vengeful pull. John's final
blood-curdling SCREAM ECHOES over --




INT./EXT. RAVENSCAR

-- through every room. Every corridor. Rippling out
across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills
beyond.




INT. CORRIDOR

On his hands and knees, John takes that first breath.
New lungs fill for the first time. No cough. Not even a
wheeze. Face has renewed color. Wrists have sealed
tight.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                          116.





CONTINUED:

John is healed.
He stands, steps back inside the --




PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

John stops over the body of one seven-foot African
warrior. He stands immobilized, wrecked with emotion.          A
SOUND draws his attention to the one thing that could
cause him even greater rage --

GABRIEL --

is hunched over near a wall. Jagged cartilage stumps
protrude from his back. A pattern of sinew and bone is
burned into the floor behind him. It's all that remains
of his once majestic wings.
John approaches, spots blood dripping from the former angel.
He realizes what this means. Gets a kick out of it.

                            JOHN

             Human...
Gabriel looks up as John retrieves a gun from the wet
floor.

                           JOHN

             You don't deserve to be human.

                           GABRIEL

             Then pass judgment on me now.
John raises the gun -- puts it to Gabriel's forehead.

                            GABRIEL

             Do it.   Seek revenge.   End my
             life.
John's finger nudges the trigger.

                           GABRIEL

             Kill me! Pull the trigger!     Be
             the hand of God!
John pauses, realizes what's happening here...

                           JOHN

             ... and I'll be condemned again...

                            GABRIEL

             Do it!

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                      117.





CONTINUED:

It takes everything John has not to pull that trigger.
He lowers the gun, shaking his head.

                           JOHN

             You're even worthless as bait.
John starts to turn away --

                           GABRIEL

             Deny your true nature today, but
             what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow
             after that? It is only a matter
             of time before you end up right
             back where you belong. It is who
             you are, Constantine. Damned.
John's fist starts behind his back, gains momentum the
entire arc until it ends abruptly against Gabriel's face.
The ex-angel is propelled all the way to the wall --
SLAMS HARD against the concrete. Body crumples on
impact, slides down to the muck. You know this hurt like
absolute hell.

                           JOHN

             That's called pain.    Get used to it.
John turns toward the double doors -- stops cold.
Huddled in the doorway, covered in grime is Angela and
Barry. The experience has obviously left them both
drained.
John walks across the room, kneels down to them.

                           ANGELA

             Thank you, John.
He nods, beat. Wipes a trace of blood off her brow, puts
a hand on Barry's shoulder. HOLD a beat ON this gritty
family tableau.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - MIDNITE'S UNIVERSAL ORRERY

MOVING SLOWLY PAST the inoperative device. PAST
strangely-shaped objects of platinum and gold, with names
and symbols that make a bit more sense now.




EXT. AFRICA - DAY

Huge sun beats down on a lone FIGURE walking across a
stretch of the most barren landscape on Earth. He stops,
kneels to the heavily-cracked soil. Starts digging.




                                                       118.





INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - THE ORRERY

A HAND comes in, affixes an unseen object to a protruding
rod. Its weight causes it to drop OUT OF FRAME but a
moment later it rises back INTO VIEW and finds a balance.




EXT. AFRICA

JOHN pulls back the protective hood from his face.
Healthy and tan with a new lease on life. He pops a
NICORETTE TABLET, then unwraps rolls of cloth from around
the Spear of Destiny. He drops it in the hole, stares at
it a long beat.




INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - THE ORRERY

The entire mechanism shudders. And now miraculously,
every globe, every moon, every obscure object in this
miniature occult universe begins to rotate in complete
sync.
As it does, the defining object finally slides INTO VIEW.
John's lighter.   ANGELA watches it rotate past, nods in
approval.




EXT. AFRICA

John sighs, finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred
relic. He stands, nods. Job done.
A breeze blows past and John senses being watched. He
spins and finds -- nothing. For a hundred miles. He
starts walking.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people are born to make a
          difference. I had to die. Twice.

                                       MATCH CUT TO:

walking right in step. Something is closing in on her.
A new TAXI pulls up. Chaz is driving. Angela gets in.

          God does work in mysterious ways.

John continues walking as something closes in on him at
incredible speed.

          Some people like it...
Our view RISES OVER him and gliding across the barren
landscape are the SHADOW of WINGS.

                        JOHN (V.O.)

          Some people don't.

          HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT,

          
          A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked
          sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED
          DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a
          small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING
          HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.

          
          The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old-
          fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids -
          is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is
          opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS
          go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button-
          eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is
          removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside
          out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.

          
          Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial
          features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a
          fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a
          button drawer.

          
          The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its
          new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and

          BACK INTO THE NIGHT.

          WIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with
          tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a
          damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads "Pink
          Palace, Apartment for Rent".

          
          MR. BOBINSKY - a seven-foot-tall blue-skinned man -
          performs calisthenics on the rooftop, counting in
          Russian.

          A BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN
          backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE -
          suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck
          and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky
          shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts:

          

                                   MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Mer-sa-vich!

          
          He marches away indignantly. One of the MOVERS, unseen in
          the truck, speaks to his companion.

          

                                 MOVER 2 (O.C.)
                    We're here. Time to muscle up.

          

          
          ANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched
          open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and
          MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of
          BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE.

          
          They haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA.

          
          NEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK,
          a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys
          the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and
          furniture. The old gal can't wait to tell her flat mate
          below about the young, strapping men.

                    Come on, now, LIFT.

          
          ANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads
          down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature
          from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers
          signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed
          in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and
          the door is shut.

          ANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the
          POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is
          rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack
          into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks
          right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern.
          OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it
          races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH
          to investigate.

          
          CORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW
          RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a
          CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a
          skeptical face.

          
          NEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances
          furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and
          moves diagonally away from the house.

          
          NEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the
          WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN.

          
          ANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She
          reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH.
          She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a
          DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden.

          
          CAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three-
          eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his
          hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy
          and follows the girl.

          Coraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds
          an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After
          rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell
          into her shoulder bag.

          
          ANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from
          the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look.
          Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it
          up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND
          blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up
          into the air.

          behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view
          Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She
          steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the
          rotted wood, stopping her.

          
          WE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones
          that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head
          our way.

          
          NEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello?...   Who's there?

          
          She throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE
          UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked
          out, she GASPS, runs up the trail.

          
          NEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat
          hops onto the stone wall.

          Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an
          ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.

          
          NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old
          apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a
          harvest cart.

          
          DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of
          TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks
          out for her pursuer.

          
          NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall
          grass. She can't see him but she knows something is
          there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the
          stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!

          
          STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both
          angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You scared me to death, you mangy thing!

          
          Cat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl
          as she stands. She exhales.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I'm just looking for an old well. Know
                    it?

          
          Cat BLINKS EYES slowly.

          

                                 CORALINE(CONT'D)
                    Not talking, huh?

          
          The wind picks up. She grasps the forks of her stick,
          closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her,

          SAYS:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...
                    the well!

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into
          frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a
          button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN.
          STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.

          
          UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS,
          Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret-
          lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S
          COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                           (freaked out)

                    AHHHHH!

          
          He REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the
          bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to
          WHACK HIM with her forked stick.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    GET AWAY FROM ME--

          
          He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the
          ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP
          onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground,
          THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE-
          EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.

          
          And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and
          this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and
          Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.

          
          Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE
          LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims
          it around.

          

                                 WYBIE

                           (OBLIVIOUS)
                    Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or
                    Utah; someplace dried out and barren,
                    right? I heard about water-witching
                    before but it doesn't make sense; I mean,
                    it's just an ordinary branch.

          
          Coraline, SNATCHES it from his GLOVED HANDS.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (ENRAGED)

                    IT'S A DOWSING ROD!

          
          Coraline smacks Wybie.

          

                                   WYBIE
                    Ow!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by

                    PSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS!

          
          He crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral
                    ­ you know, wild? Of course, I do feed
                    him every night and sometimes he'll come
                    in my window `n bring me little dead
                    things.

          
          The cat PURRS like a diesel.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (TOUGH)
                    Look, I'm from Pontiac.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huh?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch",

                    THEN--
                           (points stick, stomps foot)
                    --where's the secret WELL?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!

          
          Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy
          scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING
          made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under
          one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the
          covering.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell
                    to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a
                    sky full of stars in the middle of the
                    day.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SOFTENS)
                    Huh.

          
          Her frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head,
          noticing her change in tone. He steps off the branch, and
          the well cover thumps in place.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Surprised she let you move in...

          
          Jerks his head toward the pink house in distance.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    ... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace"
                           (indicates house in distance)
                    Won't rent to people with kids.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What do you mean?

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (suddenly worried)
                    Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.

          
          Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat.

          

                                   CORALINE

                             (SKEPTICAL)
                    Wybie?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of
                    course. What'd you get saddled with?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I wasn't saddled with anything. It's
                    Coraline.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Caroline what?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Coraline. Coraline Jones.

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (confused, not hearing it)
                    Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I
                    heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --

          
          Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    -- can lead people to have ordinary
                    expectations about a person--

          

                                 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                           (calling from afar)
                    Wyborne!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think I heard someone calling you,
                    Wyborne.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    What? I didn't hear anything--

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were-
                    you-born.

          
          A distant dinner bell clangs.

          

                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne!

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (under his breath, nervous)
                    Grandma!

          
          He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes
          closed, forcing some laughs.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan
                    water witch.

          
          He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his
          gloved hands.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    But I'd wear gloves next time.

          

                                  CORALINE

                            (SKEPTICAL)
                    Why?

          
          He points to her dowsing rod, nods.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh,
                    it's poison oak.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Ehh!!

          
          Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her
          hands on her clothes.

          
          The cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying
          look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER
          TONGUE at him.

          
          She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline
          finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE.
          Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery
          "plop" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her.

          

                                                 ROTATE DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING


          
          It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD-
          LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins,
          squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill.
          She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one
          hand.

          
          The main floor kitchen, like most   things in the Pink
          Palace, is barely maintained, and   looks worn and faded.
          Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,   bangs away at her
          laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES   stacked nearby. She's
          plain-looking and tired and wears   a NECK-BRACE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.

          

                                 MEL
                           (not listening)
                    Uh huh.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I would have died.

          

                                 MEL
                           (continues typing)
                    That's nice.

          
          Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's
                    perfect weather for gardening.

          

                                 MEL
                    No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
                    mess.

          
          Coraline turns to her.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But Mom, I want stuff growing when my
                    friends come to visit. Isn't that why we
                    moved here?

          

                                 MEL
                    Something like that. But then we had the
                    accident.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.

          

                                 MEL
                    I never said it was.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MUTTERS)
                    I can't believe it -- you and Dad get
                    paid to write about plants and you hate
                    dirt.

          
          Mel stops typing, loses her patience.

          

                                 MEL
                    Coraline, I don't have time for you right
                    now. And you still have unpacking to do.
                    Lots of unpacking.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    That sounds exciting.

          
          Mel remembers something.

          
                                 Mel (CONT'D)
                    Oh - some kid left this on the front
                    porch.

          
          Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED
          PACKAGE. Attached note reads:

          

                                 WYBIE (V.O.)
                    Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's
                    trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.

          
          She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE-
          HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head
          credits - it's a litte Coraline!

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (to herself)
                    Huh... a little me? That's weird.

          
          She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed.

          

                                 MEL
                    What's his name, anyway?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

          
          But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room.

          

          INT. STUDY - SAME


          
          CHARLIE Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning
          dark hair, HUNT-AND-PECKS at his ancient computer,
          surrounded by boxes of GARDENING MAGAZINES and empty
          coffee cups. Coraline, with doll, opens the SQUEAKY DOOR.
          He doesn't turn.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?

          
          He ignores her reflection in his computer screen as he
          types away, green letters on black. She CLEARS HER

          THROAT.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Hello, Coraline...
                           (notices doll's reflection)
                    And... Coraline doll?...

          

                                 CORALINE
                    D'you know where the garden tools are?

          
          He hears rain outside.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    It's pouring out there, isn't it.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Humph, it's just raining.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    What'd the boss say?

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MOCKING)
                    "Don't even think about going out,
                    Coraline Jones."

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Then you won't need the tools.

          
          Coraline GROANS, stamps her feet. Charlie just taps
          harder on the keys. Pouting, she makes the door squeak,
          opening and shutting it till he can't take any more. He
          spins around.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred
                    and fifty years old.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    So?

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    So explore it!

          
          He grabs a pen and pad, holds it out.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Go out and ... count all the doors and
                    windows and write that down. List
                    everything blue!

                           (BEGGING)
                    Just let me work.

          
          She rolls her eyes, takes paper and pen and leaves.

          

          

          MONTAGE, VARIOUS - SAME

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline, with doll, jumps on BUMP in carpet that moves
          with each jump.

          

          LAUNDRY ROOM/WINTER GARDEN

          
          She wipes off the misted glass so she and the doll can
          see out, then writes in her pad: 7 leaky windows. A drop
          of water lands on the pad, smearing the ink. She adds
          really between 7 and leaky windows.

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the
          stairs.

          

          PARENT'S ROOM/BATHROOM

          
          A FRAMED PHOTO sits in the foreground on a beside table.
          It shows a younger, happier Coraline with her parents by
          the BEAR FOUNTAIN at the Detroit Zoo. RACK FOCUS to
          bedroom door as it swings into the room, with Coraline
          hanging on it. She drops to the ground and, doll and pad
          in hand, decides to check out the bathroom.

          
          When she pulls aside the mildewed shower curtain she
          finds a hundred skittering SILVERFISH BUGS.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    Ewww!

          
          Disgusted, she jumps into the tub and smashes as many as
          she can.

          
          She turns on the faucet to wash her hands, only to get
          soaked with rusty water from the shower head.

          

                                    CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Ahh!!

          
          She shakes out her hair.

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump
          again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door
          opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate.

          

          WATER HEATER CLOSET

          
          ANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one
          rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks
          off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it
          that says: Do not turn off!

          

          

          INT. STUDY - SAME


          
          Lights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies. He
          hollers.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!

          

          

          INT. HALLWAY - SAME


          

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)

                    --AAAAAAA!

          
          Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the
          closet and --

          

          

          INT. CLOSET - SAME


          
          -- spots the Do not turn off note. She flips the light
          switch back on and gets out of there.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out
          on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes,
          a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A
          few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard
          mattress box leans against a corner wall.

          
          Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in
          her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open
          moving box and smiles.

          
          The box is filled with her mom's collection of
          SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR
          FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies
          the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it
          carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest
          of the snowglobes and places them beside it.

          
          Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE -
          a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand
          holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and
          adds to her list, muttering aloud.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    One boring blue boy in a painfully boring
                    painting ... four incredibly boring
                    windows ... and no... more... doors...

          
          She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow
          globe box. It's gone.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    All right, little me, where are you
                    hiding?

          
          Scanning the room, she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM
          BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall.
          Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the
          doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the
          box.

          
          She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a
          SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh?

          
          Intensely curious, she calls to the kitchen.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hey Mom...

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


          
          Mom, typing away, ignores her.

          

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)
                    Where does this door go?

          

                                 MEL
                    I'm really, really busy!

          

          INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          
          Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think it's locked.

          

                                    MEL (O.S.)

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


          

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)
                    Pleeeeeeeeease!

          
          Mel gets up, really annoyed. Big sigh.

          

                                    MEL
                    Uhhh...

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the
          door in the ratty old wallpaper.

          

                                  MEL
                    Will you stop pestering me if I do this
                    for you?

          
          Coraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog.

          

                                    MEL (CONT'D)
                    Fine.

          
          She heads back to the kitchen.

          

          

          INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          
          Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass
          and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key.
          Holds it up.

          

          

          INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          
          Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key
          in the lock. Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation,
          the doll at her side. Mel turns the key, unlocks the
          door, and pulls it open to reveal ... an UNBROKEN BRICK
          WALL. Coraline is totally disappointed.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Bricks? I don't get it.

          
          Coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance.

          

                                 MEL
                    They must have closed this off when they
                    divided up the house.

          
          Mel gets up to leave.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're kidding? And why is the door so
                    small?

          
          Mel leaving room, turns back, and loses it.

          

                                 MEL
                    We made a deal. ZIP IT!

          
          She exits. Coraline makes annoyed sound.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You didn't lock it.

          

                                  MEL (O.S.)
                    AaaaaH!!!

          
          Coraline pushes the little door shut, her head lowered.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT


          
          WIDE ANGLE ON HOUSE. Pouring rain. We hear Charlie
          singing a song about Coraline, badly.

          

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    Oh, my twitchy witchy girl,

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME


          
          CHARLIE, using OVEN MITT to protect his hand, takes a
          BURNED-UP CASSEROLE DISH from the oven while mom closes
          up her LAPTOP. Coraline sits at the table with her doll.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    I think you are so nice,
                    I give you bowls of porridge
                    And I give you bowls of ice --

          
          CHARLIE sets the dish on the table.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                           (really bad note)
                    -- cream!

          
          Coraline pushes it away, disgusted.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Why don't you ever cook, Mom?

          

                                 MEL
                    Coraline, we've been through this before:
                    your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out
                    of the way.

          
          Coraline HUFFS.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we
                    finish the catalog.
                           (indicates Coraline's plate)
                    Try some of the chard, you need a
                    vegetable.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Looks more like slime to me.

          

                                  CHARLIE
                    Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot --
                    now what's it going to be?

          
          Coraline looks to her doll, cradles its head.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Think they're trying to poison me?

          
          She makes the doll's head nod "yes." Coraline rolls her
          eyes, looks up to the heavens and --

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - SAME


          
          -- falls back, washed and dressed for bed, on her pillow.
          Still raining out. Coraline puts the doll on the chair
          beside her, then scratches at her wrist. ORIGAMI
          DRAGONFLIES are strung between the tall, thin bed posts;
          the TURTLE SHELL she found in the garden sits up on a
          box, her NIGHT LAMP that projects stars and moons is
          warming up on the bedside table. Despite her efforts at
          decorating, Coraline's new bedroom feels small and cold,
          cracked and faded.

          
          Coraline reaches for a framed PHOTO that rests on a toy
          PRAYING MANTIS by her night lamp.

          
          It's her TWO BEST FRIENDS from home, posing in the snow
          by her old school's marquee, its letters rearranged to
          spell "CORALINE, GOOD BYE!" She touches her friends'
          faces with her fingertips.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?

          
          She puts back the photo, hits the light switch over her
          bed and, looking over at the doll, sighs.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Good-night...little me.

          
          Her breathing slows and, with the doll WATCHING HER, she
          starts to fall asleep.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - DREAMTIME


          
          --SURREAL MIST SWIRLS out her window. MOONS AND STARS
          SLOWLY MOVE across the walls.

          
          SOMETHING in the room goes t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up,
          awake. SOMETHING CHITTERS under her bed. She leans over
          her bedside, head first, peering underneath when a ghost-
          pale KANGAROO MOUSE JUMPS OUT and bounds out the door.

          

          

          INT. HALL - SAME


          
          She gives chase, down the upper hall, down the stairs,
          snaps on the lower hall light, sees it hop into the
          living room.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline enters. The mouse edges out from beneath the
          sofa, then hops frantically toward the SMALL DOOR behind
          the wallpaper! Coraline runs and dives, but the door is
          open a crack, and the mouse escapes.

          
          Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open. Instead
          of a brick wall, there is a DARK, EXPANDING TUNNEL, with
          the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the
          far end.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Whoa...

          
          She catches her breath, pulls the door wider and CRAWLS

          THROUGH.

          

          INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline MOVES FORWARD, towards the light ahead.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline steps out through the same little door, into
          what looks like the EXACT SAME LIVING ROOM she just left,
          only something is different -- it feels deeper, more
          dimensional.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Huh?

          
          She looks around, notices the painting over the
          fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt
          clean and his ice cream back on his cone.

          
          From across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen
          and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    MMMMM, something smells good.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove,
          wearing an apron and ROOSTER-HEAD OVEN MITTS. The light
          and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect
          in this kitchen. Other Mother is facing away from
          Coraline as she works.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mom?! What are you doing here in the
                    middle of the night?

          
          Her mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline
          is DUMBSTRUCK: she's got BUTTONS FOR EYES! She beams with
          happiness at Coraline's arrival.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You're just in time for supper, dear!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're not my mother.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    My mother doesn't have b-b-buh...

          
          Coraline points to her own eye.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?

          
          She taps one with her nail.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell
                    your Other Father that supper's ready.

          
          She opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of
          great cooking fills the air. Coraline breathes it in,
          suddenly VERY HUNGRY.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Well, go on. He's in his study.

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME


          
          Coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door.

          

          

          INT. OTHER STUDY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She sees the back of a man like her father, only with
          more hair. Instead of tapping away at his computer,
          though, he's picking notes on a BABY GRAND PIANO.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello?

          
          He turns around. He, too, has SHINY BUTTON EYES. He seems
          happier and a little more handsome than real Dad, and
          wears an IRIDESCENT ROBE over POLKA DOT PAJAMAS, with
          ORANGE MONKEY SLIPPERS on his feet. He smiles broadly.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new
                    song?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My father can't play piano.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    No need to ... this piano plays ME!

          
          DR. SEUSS GLOVES ­ connected with rods and pulleys ­ POP
          OUT of the piano's front and ONTO HIS HANDS. His hands
          RAISE UP ­ then DROP DOWN to play pounding STRIDE PIANO
          as Other Father SINGS out.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Making up a song about Coraline.
                    She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal
                    of mine.
                    She's as cute as a button in the eyes of
                    everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor-
                    a-line.

          
          Coraline is amazed as his hands fly.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    When she comes around exploring
                    Mom and I will never ever make it boring
                    our eyes will be on Coraline.

          
          Anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I, uh ­ sorry ­ but she said to tell you
                    the food's ready.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand.

          
          He sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other
          gloved hand slaps his face. She LAUGHS, then covers her
          mouth.

          

          

          INT. OTHER DINING ROOM - SAME


          
          Other Mother sets down a HUGE, ROASTED CHICKEN near
          Coraline on a table spread with CANDLES, fine CHINA and
          SILVER and a PINEAPPLE CENTERPIECE. FIGURE EIGHT MODEL
          TRAIN TRACKS circle twin LAZY SUSANS covered in dishes of
          POTATOES, SWEET PEAS, ROLLS, and CORN. The Other Father
          seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making PRAYER HANDS
          and a solemn face.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    We give our thanks and ask to bless,
                    Our Mother's golden chicken breast!

          
          He laughs with glee then a STARTING BELL rings and it's
          time to eat. Other Father really digs in while Coraline
          tries some chicken.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mmmm, this chicken is good.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Hungry, aren't you.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (nodding, mouth full)
                    D'you have any gravy?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo-
                    choo!

          
          Other Mother GIGGLES as a MODEL TRAIN circles round the
          track, pulling a GRAVY BOAT CAR and blowing its whistle.
          The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes
          out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with
          Coraline's plate, where it POURS GRAVY on her potatoes.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the
                    cob?

          
          Other Mother looks on approvingly, not touching any food
          herself.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (mouth full)
                    I'm real thirsty.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Of course! Any requests?

          
          A beautiful CHANDELIER DRINK DISPENSER descends.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mango milk shake?

          
          The dispenser SPINS, stops and fills her glass while
          Other Mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that
          POP UP and LIGHT THEMSELVES while the words "WELCOME
          HOME!" write themselves in icing. Coraline is taken
          aback.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Home?

          
          Her Other Parents squeeze each other's hands warmly.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    We've been waiting for you, Coraline.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    For me?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Yep. Wasn't the same here without you,
                    kiddo.

          
          Coraline remains a little unsure.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I didn't know I had an Other Mother.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Of course you do. Everyone does.

          
          She smiles at Coraline, her button eyes gleaming.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Really?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Uh huh, and soon as you're through
                    eating, I thought we'd play a game.

          
          She taps her fingers a little too excitedly on the table.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    You mean like, hide and seek?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What rain?

          
          THUNDER, LIGHTNING, then RAIN appears outside the window.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh, what about the mud?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    We love mud here!

          
          Other Mother rises, walks towards Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's
                    great for poison oak.

          
          The takes Coraline's rashy hand, but Coraline pulls it
          away.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SUSPICIOUS)
                    How'd you know I--

          
          Coraline adjusts her tone.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get
                    home to my other mother.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    But I'm your other mother.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (BEFUDDLED)
                    I mean my other other mother. Mom number
                    one?

                           (YAWNS)
                    I think I should get to bed.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (shakes head)
                    But ...

          
          Other Father steps in beside her.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Come along, sleepyhead.

          
          They lead her from the table towards the stairs to her
          bedroom.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - SAME


          
          In this world, Coraline's bedroom is a dream come true:
          it is filled with rich color and light; there's a fire in
          the fireplace, a sheer, lacy canopy over her now
          beautiful bed. And her favorite toys are alive!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wow.

          
          Her ORIGAMI DRAGONFLIES FLUTTER towards her.

          

                                 DRAGONFLIES
                    Hello Coraline, hello, hello!

          
          Her BLUE SQUID greets her with a WAVE of its tentacle.

          

                                 TOY SQUID
                    What's shakin', baby?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello.

          
          The TURTLE SHELL she'd found CIRCLES HER FEET on clothes
          pin legs, making PANTING SOUNDS. She laughs, then hears
          two voices from beside her bed.

                           (MICHIGAN-SPEAK)
                    Where's your swampers and tuke?

          
          She jumps onto the bed, grabs the photo of her best
          friends from home, now ALIVE IN THE PHOTO.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls?
                    I can't wait till summer. You're both
                    comin', right?

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 1
                    We're already here, Coraline --

          

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 2

          
                    -- gone to Or-e-gine!

          
          Coraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns,
          stretching out her arms.

          
          The Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand
          and applies some SOOTHING BLACK MUD to Coraline's poison
          oak rash.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, the mud...

          
          The Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the
          Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to
          sleep.

          

                  OTHER MOTHER                  OTHER FATHER
          See you soon ...              See you soon ...

          

                                                      PULL BACK MATCH

                                                            DISSOLVE:

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S REAL BEDROOM - MORNING


          
          Coraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright
          colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM:
          moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed.

          
          She notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she
          left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it
          up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops,
          noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (GASPING)
                    It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!...

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks
          behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was
          only a dream.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SOFTLY)
                    Huh?

          
          She shakes her head and pushes the door shut. The kettle
          blows from the kitchen.

          

          

          KITCHEN - DAY, GROUND FOG OUT WINDOWS

          
          Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean
          Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied
          with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts
          her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the
          windows.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you
                    weren't really you; you were my other
                    mother.

          

                                 MEL

                           (DISAPPROVING)
                    Buttons for eyes, huh?
                           (indicates untouched food)
                    Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all
                    that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at
                    least.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You were in the dream too, Dad. You had
                    wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey
                    slippers.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                           (pretend offense)
                    Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.

          
          He stands, put his dishes in the sink. Whispers over his

          SHOULDER:

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)

                           (OPTIONAL)
                    Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic
                    mud you were talking about?

          
          She points to her rash-free wrists. He nods.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Because I have a terrible case of
                    writer's rash. On my---.

          
          Mel CLEARS HER THROAT, interrupting.

          

                                 MEL
                    If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages
                    edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP.

          
          He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches
          out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with
          Coraline.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    Coraline, why don't you go visit
                    downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would
                    love to hear your dream.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said
                    they're dingbats.

          

                                    MEL

                           (NODS)
                    Uh huh.

          
          Coraline sighs, gets up to go.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, FRONT PORCH - MORNING


          
          It's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house
          and grounds. Coraline ­ yellow rain poncho, garden SHEARS
          in hand ­ opens the front door. Stepping out onto the
          porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she
          picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...

          
          Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Ohh, Poo-eeeee!

          
          She goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads
          "Bobinsky there" with an arrow that points up long,
          winding outside stairs. With an "oh well" shrug, she goes
          up.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, BOBINSKY'S - CONTINUOUS


          
          At the top, she knocks on the door, a little anxious.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    H-hello?...

          
          She knocks again.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I
                    leave it outside or...

          
          The door swings open. Curious, Coraline peeks inside:
          it's dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove
          and a caged chicken.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hmmm...

          
          Suddenly a HUGE BLUE MAN swings down behind her and

          SCOLDS:

          

                                  MR. BOBINSKY

                    SEE-KRET...

          
          She whips around to find MR. Bobinsky - upside down,
          reaching right at her face! She ducks and he reaches past
          her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it
          shut.
          The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and
          shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants. He's not happy.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

                           (SCOWLING)
                    Famous Jumping Mouse Circus not ready,
                    little girl!

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (CONFUSED)
                    Circus?... Oh, uh, I brought this for
                    you.

          
          She holds out his mail. Bobinsky takes it, smelling the
          stinky envelopes deeply. Nods approvingly.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY

                           (SNIFFS)
                    Mmmm... Noviseer.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Huh?

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    New "cheese" samples.

          
          He swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her
          on the balcony. Coraline backs away.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Very clever, using this "mix up" to sneak
                    my home and peek at meeshkas

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Meeshkas?

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    The Mice!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.

          

                                  MR. BOBINSKY

                           (BOWS)
                    And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you
                    can call me Mr. B, because amazing I
                    already know that I am.

          
          He smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems
          to fall off the side of the third story porch! Coraline
          rushes over, looks down. He cartwheels in from the porch
          railing behind her.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my
                    new songs go oompah oompah. But the
                    jumping mice play only toodle toot, like
                    that. Is nice, but not so much amazing?
                    So now--
                           (indicates smelly mail)
                    --I switch to stronger cheese, and soon ­

                    VATCH OUT!

          
          He opens his door, crouches low and turns. He hands her a
          beet.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Here, have beet. Make you strong.
                           (salutes her )
                    Daas vee DAAN ya, Caroline.

          
          He scuttles inside and slams the door shut. Coraline
          mutters.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Cor-a-line.

          
          Looking at the beet, she makes a disgusted sound and
          tosses it away, then heads down the stairs.

          

          

          EXT HOUSE, SOUTH SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

          
          When she gets to the bottom, she starts towards the back,
          gardening shears out.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (to herself)
                    Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (O.C.)

                    EHHH! CAROLINE: PA-DAZH-DI'-- WAIT!!

          
          She looks up.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    No!!!

          
          Bobinsky LEAPS all the way to the ground, landing beside
          her, out of breath.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    The mice...asked me to give you message.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The...jumping mice?

          
          Mr. B nods gravely. He leans down, so close his moustache
          touches her ear, and whispers, his voice DEAD-SERIOUS.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    They are saying: do not go through leetle
                    door. Do you know such a thing?

          
          Coraline is startled.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The one behind the wall paper? But...
                    it's all bricked up.

          
          The old man shrugs, straightens.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the
                    mice are leetle...

          
          He points to his head and rotates his finger.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    ...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your
                    name wrong, you know. They call you
                    Coraline instead of Caroline, not
                    Caroline at all.

          
          He starts back up the stairs.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Maybe I work them too hard...

          
          Coraline stares after him.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          SHEARS IN HAND, Coraline approaches the family VW, where
          one PINK SUITCASE remains tied to the roof. She snips it
          free and takes out her special HAT, a black Japanese
          schoolboy's cap.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, STAIRWELL DOWNSTAIRS FLAT ­ SAME


          
          Coraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat. At
          the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and
          waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it
          reads "No whistling in the house."

          
          She peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly
          LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS
          SPINK ­ wearing some sort of house robe ­ opens the door
          and three SCOTTIE DOGS ­ HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS ­ shoot
          out and surround Coraline. Spink tries to quiet them
          down.

          

                                 MISS SPINK

                           (HARSH)
                    Oh cease your infernal yapping!
                           (to Coraline, sweetly)
                    How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you
                    like to come in? We're playing cards.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Still Coraline, Miss Spink.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                           (over shoulder)
                    Miriam, put the kettle on!

          

          

          INT. MISSES SPINK & FORCIBLE'S FLAT - SAME


          
          Miss Spink leads Coraline into the living area, as MISS
          FORCIBLE, taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very
          large bosom, prepares tea in the kitchen to the side. The
          dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa. Coraline scans
          the walls to see framed POSTERS from the "Shakespeare"
          the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius
          Seize Her. Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind
          without her glasses.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    April, I think you're being followed.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline?
                    She'll be having the Oolong tea.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer
                    Jasmine.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    No, Oolong.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Ah, Jasmine it is, then.

          
          Forcible grabs a handful of tea, puts it in the pot and
          pours boiling water in.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Come on, boys!

          
          The dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their
          place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase
          filled with STUFFED SCOTTY DOGS IN KNITTED SWEATERS WITH

          ANGEL WINGS.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (ALARMED)
                    Are those dogs .... real?

          

                                 MISS SPINK

                           (SIGHS)
                    Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear
                    to part with them ... so we had them
                    stuffed.

                           (CONTINUES)

                                 (MORE)

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Now, there's Hamish the third, the
                    fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the
                    second, the fifth, the..

          
          Miss Forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges Coraline
          to take a candy as Spink goes on and on.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh go on, have one ­ it's hand-pulled
                    taffy from Brighton ­ best in the world.

          
          Coraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy
          is so old and sticky, her fingers get stuck. Then her
          other hand gets stuck, trying to get the first hand out.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (O.C.)
                    ...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes,
                    the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior,
                    Jock senior, Jock the third, the
                    fourth...

          
          Coraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy
          bowl which FLIES UP and sticks to the ceiling.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    ...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin,
                    twice removed.

          
          She turns to Coraline, about to sip her tea. Spink
          indicates cup.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    I'll read them, if you like.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Read what?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell
                    me your future. Drink up then, go on.

          
          Coraline gulps down the bitter brew.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    No, not all of it, not all of it. That's
                    right, now hand it over.

          
          Coraline passes her the cup. Spink puts a saucer on top
          and swirls it three times, removes the saucer and peers
          in at the abstract leaf pattern. She purses her lips.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Oh... Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you
                    are in terrible danger.

          
          Miss Forcible snorts.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes
                    are going.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    My eyes! You're blind as a bat!

          
          Spink passes the cup to Forcible, who adjusts thick
          glasses and peers closely into it.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child,
                    it's good news: there's a tall, handsome
                    beast in your future.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    A what?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Miriam, oh really, you're holding it
                    wrong.

          
          Spink forcibly rotates the cup.

          

                                   MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    See? Danger!

          
          Coraline wants more information.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What do you see?

          
          The ladies, heads side by side, gaze into the cup. We see
          a SPIKY CLAW formed from the leaves.

          

                                 MISS SPINK

                           (OMINOUS)
                    I see a very peculiar hand...

          
          Forcible rotates the cup back again. Upside down, the
          claw hand looks like a GIRAFFE.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    I see a giraffe.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Giraffes don't just fall from the sky,
                    Miriam.

          
          The stuck candy dish suddenly CRASHES to the floor.

          

                                  MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Oh!

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Oh, lord!

          
          Coraline asks in a practical voice:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, what should I do?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Never wear green in your dressing room.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Acquire a very tall step ladder.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    And be very, very careful. Now, was there
                    something you came to tell us?

          
          Coraline thinks it over, then shakes her head.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea,
                    though.

          
          She gets up and leaves, the dogs immediately return to
          their sofa.

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Toodle-oo.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    Cheery-bye.

          
          The ladies resume their card game with Miss Spink turning
          to the dogs.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    Do you have any nice Queens for mummy?

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE, TOP OF BASEMENT FLAT STAIRS - SAME


          
          Coraline climbs the stairs up to ground level, intrigued
          by her fortune.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (to herself)
                    Danger?

          
          Behind her, a PERISCOPE RISES from the WAIST-DEEP FOG.
          Coraline just catches it in her peripheral view.

          
          She frowns but doesn't let on she's aware of it. She
          walks ahead nonchalantly, the periscope following her,
          then suddenly turns and GRABS it, PULLING UP WYBIE, then
          PUNCHES him in the arm.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Owwwwwwww!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Great, the village stalker.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're
                    hunting banana slugs.

          
          Wybie takes some SALAD TONGS from a tool belt, snaps
          them.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What d'ya mean, "we?"

          
          There's a soft meowing from under his coat. He opens it
          up and the BLACK CAT EMERGES and climbs onto his
          shoulders.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss-
                    puss!

          
          Cat glares at her angrily.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MOCKING)
                    Wuss-puss...

          
          Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a
          tree and up onto the roof of the house. Coraline softens.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    So... that doll. Did you make it look
                    like me?

          
          Wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks
          his head up for a moment.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Oh no; I found it that way. It's older
                    than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly.

          
          Coraline is highly skeptical. Wybie returns to his hunt.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (points to self)
                    C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and
                    raincoat?

          
          Wybie stands excitedly and presents a HUGE YELLOW-GREEN
          SLUG to Coraline.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Dang, check out Slugzilla!

          
          She's not impressed.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (FRUSTRATED)
                    You're just like them.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huh?

          
          He looks from the slug to himself.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I meant my parents; they don't listen to
                    me either.

          
          Wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera --

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Uh huh... You mind?

          
          -- hands it to her. She acts put-out, but frames a shot.
          He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash
          shot after another as he strikes silly poses making SOUND
          EFFECTS: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat
          it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in
          another. She can't help but GIGGLE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ew!

          
          Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and
          takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful,
          then glances up past Coraline at the house. He SIGHS and
          speaks in a SAD TONE.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    You know, I've never been inside the Pink
                    Palace.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SCEPTICAL)
                    You're kidding.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's
                    dangerous or something.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    Dangerous?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Well... she had a twin sister.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    So?

          

                                 WYBIE (O.C.).
                    When they were kids, Grandma's sister
                    disappeared.

                           (ON CAMERA)
                    She says she was stolen.

          

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    Stolen?

          
          ANGLE from roof, over CAT'S SHOULDER as dialog continues.
          Cat senses something and turns -- it's Coraline's DOLL AT
          THE WINDOW, looking like it's spying on things.

          

                                 CORALINE(CONT'D)
                    Well, what do you think?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Uhhh, I-I don't know.

          
          BACK TO KIDS. Wybie, astride his electric bike now,
          WHISTLES and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto
          his shoulders.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    Maybe she just ran away?

          
          We hear Wybie's agitated grandmother call out.

          

                                    WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne!

          
          Wybie turns away: he's said too much.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Look, I gotta go.

          
          He starts to pull away.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wait a minute!

          
          And he's gone. PUSH IN on her pensive face.

          

          

          INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          
          CU ON DOLL FACE, back in   the chair by the bed. Coraline
          takes some yellow cheese   from her pocket and puts it by
          the door: mice bait. She   lies down and her breathing
          slows, the doll watching   her with a nearly IMPERCEPTIBLE
          SMILE on its face.

          

          

          INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - LATER

          
          Coraline sleeping, lighting suggests another dream. SOME
          THINGS go t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up, looks to her
          door, and spots a COUPLE OF KANGAROO MICE stealing the
          last bit of cheese.

          

          

          INT. UPPER HALL - SAME


          
          She gives chase after the mice, hopping down the stairs
          with the cheese.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline follows the kangaroo mice directly to the little
          door, opened a crack, where they disappear.

          
          She pulls it open. Bricks are gone; tunnel revealed. She
          doesn't hesitate this time to crawl through the door.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Coraline enters Other Kitchen to find Other Mother
          preparing a delicious breakfast. She looks PRETTIER
          tonight; her black hair shining, lips REDDER. She stops
          HUMMING A LULLABY to greet Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Welcome back, darling.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    Hi.

          
          She is grating YELLOW CHEESE into scrambled eggs.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    So thoughtful of you to send this nice
                    cheddar, Coraline.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait...

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Would you go fetch your father?

          
          Beams at Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You mean my Other Father?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Your better father, dear.   He's out in
                    the garden.

          

                                 CORALINE.
                    But my parents don't have time to garden.

          
          Other Mother SHUSHES her and pops a strawberry in her
          mouth.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mmmmmm!

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Go on...

          
          Coraline shrugs okay, starts for the door.

          

          

          EXT STUDY DOOR TO BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          
          Looking out, she sees the broken-down garden from the
          real world, still grey and lifeless in the dim light.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME


          
          Coraline opens the gate to the garden. A large CRESCENT
          MOON RISES, and THINGS START TO GROW.

          
          Two dead shrubs start to RISE, then BLOSSOM, then the
          blossoms themselves are LIT UP by some GOLD AND AMBER

          HUMMINGBIRDS.

          
          The hummingbirds circle around Coraline, light her
          DRAGONFLY BARRETTE, then continue on, LIGHTING UP PITCHER
          PLANTS that have grown up in a nearby flower bed. A
          beautiful FROG POKES OUT of one blossom.

          
          The birds lead Coraline up steps past a stone wall where

          BLEEDING HEART GROW, AND GLOW, AND BEAT.

          
          She spots the Other Father, riding a PRAYING MANTIS
          TRACTOR on the hillside, planting SEEDS that instantly
          grow into FLOWERING PLANTS.

          

                                    OTHER FATHER
                    Hey!!!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I love your garden!

          
          He waves back, calling:

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Our garden, Coraline!

          
          A gang of SNAP DRAGONS goes at her, TICKLING Coraline
          till she falls down. Her squeals of delight grow into

          HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (GIGGLING)
                    Oh ah, stop! Stop tickling, ah!

          
          The Other Father hears this and looks over.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Oops, daughter in distress!

          
          He guns the tractor full-speed over a little bridge,
          grabbing a GOURD TRUMPET from a vine and blowing it.

          
          JACK-O-LANTERNS surface in the pond below and spout

          STREAMS OF WATER.

          
          Arriving beside Coraline, he waggles his finger at the
          naughty snapdragons.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Tickle no more, you dragon snappers!

          
          Then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to
          Coraline. She nods thanks.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, she says it's time for dinner ...
                    breakfast ... food?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you
                    something!

          
          She does. The Other Father grabs the GEARSHIFT KNOB,
          pulls it, and the mechanical mantis SPROUTS WINGS. They
          RISE in the air. Looking down, she sees that the garden
          is a PORTRAIT OF CORALINE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I can't believe you did this!

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows
                    you like the back of her hand.

          
          He pulls a lever and they ZOOM out of frame.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - SAME


          
          Coraline doesn't hold back this time. She stacks sausages
          on eggs on top of waffles, rolls it up and stuffs it in
          her mouth. The Other Mother FEEDS BITS OF SAUSAGE to the
          HUNGRY SNAPDRAGONS bouquet now in a vase.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mmmm...so good!

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    I love dinner, breakfast food.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to
                    come see the Jumping Mice perform after
                    dinner.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it
                    was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was
                    wrong.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Well, everything's right in this world,
                    Kiddo.

          
          Coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while
          her Other Parents smile at one another.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Your father and I will clean up while you
                    and your friend head upstairs.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My friend?

          
          There's a KNOCK at the door. Other Mother opens it to
          reveal the OTHER WYBIE. He's cleaner, with better
          posture, and cute button eyes.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were-
                    you-born.

          
          The boy nods, button eyes shining.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

          
          He just makes a shy smile, doesn't answer. She's
          confused.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    I thought you'd like him more, if he
                    spoke a little less.
                           (shrugs, smiling)
                    So I fixed him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    So he can't talk at all?

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Nope.

          
          She looks Other Wybie over appreciatively.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hmm, I like it.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER

                           (PROUDLY)
                    Now run along, you two, and have fun.

          
          Coraline heads out the door with the mute boy.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - SAME


          
          The Other House ­ lit by amber spotlights looks MAGICAL
          with ornate GINGERBREAD TRIM; glowing TOPIARY in the
          yard. The kids come out the front door.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're awful cheerful, considering you
                    can't say anything.

          
          Other Wybie nods in agreement. Coraline and he start up
          the stairs to Bobinsky's.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she...

          
          She points to her mouth. There's an awkward moment and
          then he points past her, excitedly: a SMALL BLIMP is
          flying towards Bobinsky's door.

          
          They run up the stairs and watch it slip through an
          opening above his door. Coraline knocks and the door
          suddenly SPINS, THROWING THEM INSIDE.

          

          

          INT. OTHER MR. BOBINSKY'S FLAT - SAME


          
          They somersault to a stop and sit up. Down two rows of
          SMALL CANNONS that face each, an amazing MINIATURE CIRCUS
          has been set up, with a FERRIS WHEEL beside it.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Whoa... cool!

          
          Coraline goes right to the Ferris wheel where a
          MECHANICAL CHICKEN eats dried corn on the cob, fires up
          its belly, then POOPS OUT POPCORN into paper bags.

          
          Other Wybie stomps a firing button and COTTON CANDY
          shoots out of a cannon. He catches the cone, then starts
          firing off all the cannons. Coraline looks back to find
          him covered in the cotton candy.

          

                                   CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Look at you!

          
          Spotlights come on in the big top, the entrance opens,
          and a big voice is heard over loudspeakers.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)

                    and AH-MAZING Jumping Mouse Circus!

          
          They sit between miniature grandstands and watch as the
          little BLIMP, bathed in spotlights, enters through a
          flap. It circles around, rising to the top of the tent,
          then NOSE-DIVES towards the ground! It CRASHES in the
          center of the circus ring, and OPENS LIKE A FLOWER from
          which 50 JUMPING MICE spring up like Chinese acrobats to
          spell out C O R A L I N E.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (DELIGHTED)
                    My name!

          
          The jumping mice leap to the ground in formation,
          BRANDISH TINY INSTRUMENTS, and DRUMMERS START POUNDING.
          The DRUM MAJOR MOUSE parachutes down and whips out a
          BATON. On his signal, the group launch into a WILD

          RUSSIAN CIRCUS MARCH.

          
          Coraline, grinning, turns to the Other Wybie.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    It's wonderful, Wybie!

          
          The boy smiles and nods to the beat of the bass drums as
          the hopping band marches in and out of ever changing
          formations - PINWHEELS, X's, CIRCLES WITHIN CIRCLES.

          
          They hoppers begin to SPIRAL to the center of the circus
          ring when the floor RISES UP from its center to form a
          six-foot Tower of Babel, the mice HOPPING TO THE TOP. The
          DRUM MAJOR balances on the tippy-top on a COLORFUL CIRCUS

          BALL.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Wow!

          
          He RUNS the ball DOWN AND AROUND the spiral as the MICE
          HOP OFF, and when he hits the ground, the TOWER DROPS
          AWAY to reveal the OTHER MISTER BOBINSKY! He CRACKS A

          WHIP.

          
          Coraline and Other Wybie STAND and CLAP. Other Bobinsky ­
          in a RINGMASTER'S OUTFIT with a full length cape ­ bows
          graciously, doffing his tall black hat. His moustache is
          waxed, his eyes black buttons.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great!

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    Very very thank you, lady and gentleman.

          
          On cue, the entire jumping mice band DISAPPEARS INTO
          OTHER MR. B'S SLEEVES while the drum major SWINGS UP from
          the man's moustache and onto his head, where he's quickly
          hidden by the tall black hat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so--

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

                           (COACHING)

                    AHHHHHH---

          

                                 CORALINE
                    A-mazing!

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    You are very velcome anytime you like,
                    you and also your good friend there.

          
          She happily turns to Other Wybie, beaming with joy.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY(CONT'D)
                    Dosvedanya, Coraline.

          
          Bobinsky takes her hand to kiss it.

          Other Mother kisses SLEEPING CORALINE'S forehead, sits
          back in the bedside chair. Other Father, close by, pulls
          a cotton candy cone off Other Wybie and munches it.
          Coraline's Other Parents smile warmly, knowing something
          secret that makes them glad.

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - DAY


          
          EARLY MORNING. Coraline once again wakes in own bed in
          the real world, the little doll ­ left on the chair ­ now
          clutched against her chest.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ughhh.

          
          Her gaze moves from the doll to where she left the cheese
          by the door. It's GONE. This is much too confusing.

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline tries the small door in the corner wall. It's
          locked. What the heck?

          

          

          EXT. SMALL OFFICE BUILDING IN TOWN - DAY


          
          --SQUEALING brakes, as the Jones' JEEP pulls up in front
          of "Northwest Garden" headquarters. TOWNSFOLK in
          SHAKESPEAREAN COSTUMES stand about, advertising a local
          festival. Coraline is sharing her latest dream:

          

                                 CORALINE (V.O.).
                    ... there were garden squash like balloon
                    animals AND snap dragons.

          
          ON FAMILY: Coraline continues from back seat as her
          father and mother review their work pages.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse
                    circus, not pretend like the crazy man's
                    in our house.

          
          Her parents, preoccupied, ignore her.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    You sure you won't come?

          

                                 MEL
                           (indicates neck brace)
                    Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new
                    catalog. At least, they'll love my
                    chapters.

          
          Gives her an "aren't you funny" look, opens door. Mel
          looks back at Coraline.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    I did not call him crazy, Coraline.   He's
                    drunk.

          
          She makes the hand-thumb bottle sign. Charlie leans in to
          Coraline, pinches her nose.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Well, I guess I'll see you around, you
                    dizzy dreamer.

          
          Coraline cuts him off, embarrassed.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Da-ad! I'm not five anymore.

          
          Dad sighs, heads up the steps to his appointment as Mel
          and Coraline drive off.

          

          

          INT. UNIFORMS DEPARTMENT STORE - SAME


          
          PRESIDENT'S DAY SALE. Mel piles gray blouses, a navy
          skirt, white socks onto the arms of a CLERK.

          
          Sitting alone on some stairs, Coraline sees a pair of
          fancy GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES.

          
          As she tries them on, a YOUNG RASCAL in costume with
          sword BOUNCES PAST her down the stairs on a WHEELED STEP
          STOOL - his FATHER in pursuit.

          

                                 YOUNG RASCAL
                    My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!

          
          There's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls
          back to Coraline. She gets an idea.

          
          Mel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls
          past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the
          colorful gloves. Without looking up, her mom tells her:

          

                                 MEL
                    Put them back.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear
                    boring gray clothes. No one will have
                    these.

          

                                 MEL
                    Put them back.

          
          Coraline mutters:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My other mother would get them.

          

                                 MEL
                    Maybe she should buy all your clothes.

          
          Coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves.

          

          

          INT. CAR - SAME


          
          Coraline and Mel are driving home, shopping bags in back.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    So what do you think's in the other
                    apartment?

          

                                 MEL
                    I don't know. Not a family of Jones
                    imposters.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Then why'd you lock the door?

          

                                 MEL
                           (shorter than previous)
                    Oh, I found some rat crap and... I
                    thought you'd feel ... safer.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams
                    aren't dangerous; they're the most fun
                    I've had since we've moved here.

          

                                 MEL
                    Your school might be fun.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    With those stupid uniforms?   Right.

          

                                 MEL
                    Had to give it a try.

          
          They pull into their DRIVEWAY.

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME


          
          Mel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas
          from the fridge.

          

                                 MEL
                    How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup-
                    salsa wrap for lunch?

          
          Coraline, carrying in the bags from outside, makes a
          face.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Are you kidding me?

          

                                 MEL
                    Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway.
                    Dad's planning something special.

          
          Coraline squinches up her nose.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Gross-gusting.

          

                                 MEL

                           (BRIGHTENS )
                    You wanna come along? You can pick out
                    something you like.

          
          Coraline plops down in a chair.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, like the gloves?

          
          Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl
          pulls away.

          

                                 MEL
                    Look, Coraline... if things go well
                    today, I promise I'll make it up.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    That's what you always say.

          
          Mom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door
          to leave.

          

                                 MEL
                    Won't be long.

          
          Shuts the door.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MUTTERS)
                    But I might be...

          
          She leaves.

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME


          
          Coraline pulls open the key drawer, looking for the small
          black key. Not there. She looks around, then spots it
          hanging on a hook above a door. She stands on a chair and
          snags it.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Coraline stoops in front of the small door and pushes the
          key into the keyhole and unlocks the door.

          
          She listens for her mother's car. Nothing. Grasping the
          key between thumb and forefinger, she closes her eyes,
          she pulls the door open.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE: A SOFT BREEZE MOVES her hair. She
          knows before her eyes open that the BRICKS ARE GONE.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (TRIUMPHANT)
                    I knew it was real!

          
          She opens her eyes, smiles, and CRAWLS FORWARD.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE THROUGH WINDOW. CAMERA PULLS BACK and
          we FIND the BLACK CAT, perched on the wet window sill,
          OBSERVING Coraline as she disappears into the tunnel.
          With a look of concern, he exits frame.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Lunch is ready and waiting for her: foot-long hotdogs
          with relish; grilled cheese sandwiches with gherkins;
          curly-fries; piles of coleslaw and potato salad; five
          flavors of soda-pop. There's a NOTE attached to a GIFT-

          WRAPPED BOX:

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)

                    like the new outfit I made you! Love,
                    Mother.

          
          Coraline tears open the box and finds a pair of beautiful
          BLUE BOOTS, BLACK CORDUROY TROUSERS, and a METALLIC GREY

          SWEATER WITH TWINKLING STARS.

          
          She holds up the sweater to her body, smiles, then puts
          down the clothes and digs into lunch.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE - SAME


          
          Coraline, dressed in her FANCY NEW CLOTHES, steps onto
          the FRONT PORCH and BURPS. It's always nighttime in this
          world.

          
          A CAT MEEEROWS. Coraline looks up to see a BLACK CAT on
          the porch roof above her.

          
          Coraline raises her brows, studies the animal a moment.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at
                    home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that
                    talks too much. You must be the Other
                    Cat.

          
          The cat LEAPS down and lands on the railing by the
          basement stairs. He shakes his head and SPEAKS!

          

                                 CAT
                    No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me.

          
          He tips his head to one side, opal blue eyes glinting.
          Coraline is surprised.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Um... I can see you don't have button
                    eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can
                    you talk?

          
          The cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers.

          

                                  CAT
                    I just can.

          
          He leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large,

          FALLEN TREE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Cats don't talk at home.

          

                                  CAT
                    No?

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Nope.

          
          Climbs up the tree's upended roots, head held high and
          proud.

          

                                 CAT

                           (DRYLY)
                    Well, you're clearly the expert on these
                    things. After all, I'm just a big fat
                    wuss puss.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I
                    called you that, I really am.

          
          Coraline forces herself to be polite.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    How'd you get here?

          

                                 CAT
                    I've been coming here for a while.

          
          He DISAPPEARS behind one a thick root that sticks up,
          then REAPPEARS from a large knot hole beside Coraline,
          startling her.

          

                                 CAT (CONT'D)
                    It's a game we play. She...
                           (indicates house)
                    ...hates cats and tries to keep me out.
                    But she can't, of course.

          
          He pokes his HEAD DOWN into the knot hole, then POPS IT
          UP out of ANOTHER KNOT-HOLE, ten feet away.

          

                                 CAT (CONT'D)
                    I come and go as I please.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    The Other Mother hates cats?

          

                                 CAT

                           (CONTEMPTUOUS)
                    Not like any "mother" I've ever known.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What do you mean? She's amazing!

          
          Cat climbs the tree's branches onto the roof.

          

                                 CAT
                    You probably think this world is a dream
                    come true. But you're wrong. The Other
                    Wybie told me so.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    That's nonsense. He can't talk.

          
          The cat looks at her, pitying her lack of intelligence.

          

                                 CAT
                    Perhaps not to you. We cats, however,
                    have far superior senses than humans and
                    can see and smell, and --

          
          Suddenly, the cat drops into a crouch and freezes,
          sensing something.

          

                                 CAT (CONT'D)

                           (WHISPERING)
                    Shhhh! I hear something! Right ...over...

          
          He SCRAMBLES across the roof and disappears around the
          corner.

          
          Coraline shrugs, skeptical, and heads down to Spink and
          Forcible's, their door now circled with CHASER LIGHTS.

          

          

          INT. MISS SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S OTHER APARTMENT - SAME


          
          She pushes past elegant VELVET CURTAINS to discover an
          enormous, darkened THEATER with dim rows of seats and a
          high WOODEN STAGE.

          
          A FLASHLIGHT comes towards her, carried by a black
          SCOTTIE DOG with button eyes. He looks up at her, sniffs,
          then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of
          BUTTON-EYED SCOTTIES, to a front seat by the Other Wybie.
          She squeezes his arm hello, he looks back warmly.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Hey, Wybie.

          
          Light flash, the audience quiets, then the curtains open
          on a SEASIDE SETTING with ROTATING WAVES. OTHER MISS
          SPINK rises up on stage left, in a MERMAID SUIT, large
          WIG, BUTTON EYES, and UKULELE.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (SHOCKED)
                    She's practically naked!

          
          And Miss Spink sings.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    I'm known as the siren of all seven seas
                    The breaker of hearts by the bay.

          
          A flat cut-out ship manned by cut-out men rows in behind
          her.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    So, if you go swimmin'
                    With bow-legged women,
                    I might steal your weak heart away.

          
          She bows her head and the audience of dogs THUMP their
          tails.

          
          Spink is LOWERED through the stage floor, the SCENERY
          CHANGES, and on the right, a huge SCALLOP SHELL RISES up
          with the OTHER MISS FORCIBLE, clad in the bare minimum -
          her homage to Botticelli's BIRTH OF VENUS. She's facing
          the wrong way.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (whisper, to Wybie)
                    Oh my God.

          
          A dog HOWLS, alerting the near-blind lady, who turns to
          the audience and begins the next verse.

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through
                    the waves,
                    And hope to lead sailors astray,
                    But a true ocean goddess,
                    Must fill out her bodice,
                           (indicates her ample bosom)
                    To present an alluring display.

          
          The dogs thump and woof, Wybie and Coraline clap.

          
          Spink, furious at the greater reaction, gets back in the
          competition. Rising up, she makes it clear just who she's
          dissing.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Beware of old oysters, too large in the
                    chest,
                    Let's banish them from the buffet.

          
          But Forcible is up to the challenge - the scenery starts
          to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and
          down, competing.

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
                    I'm far more nutritious

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    You smell like the fishes

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Did I hear a banshee?

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    You're sea-green with envy

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    This mermaid enchantress,

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    No, I "Birth of Venus!"

          
          The set rigging can't take it anymore -- ropes snap,
          sandbags swing, scenery starts to fall.

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

                                 (CONT'D)
                    Will send sailors swooning --oh--!

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Will send sailors swooning --oh--!

          

          
          With a crash, the old ladies TUMBLE DOWN IN A PILE.
          Coraline winces. The audience HOWLS with laughter as the
          curtains close on the disaster.

          

          
          DRUM ROLL. A SCOTTIE DOG pushes a large BUCKET OF WATER,
          labeled "POOL", onto center stage. Spotlights tilt up to
          the top of very tall diving platforms WHERE THE OLD
          LADIES NOW STAND. Coraline can't stand it.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (WHISPERS)
                    I can't look!

          

                                 OTHER MISS SPINK
                    Ready to break a leg, Miriam?

          

                                 OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
                    Our lives for the theater, April!

          
          They begin to bounce on the diving boards. As they bounce
          up, the two troupers unzip FAT SUIT DISGUISES from which
          emerge their YOUNGER BEAUTIFUL SELVES which LEAP to catch
          matching TRAPEZE BARS that swing into place.

          
          Coraline LAUGHS with relief and amazement, Other Wybie
          pleased. Dogs WOOF, MUSIC BEGINS and the TWO BEAUTIES ­
          eyes BRIGHT BUTTONS, SEXY BATHING SUITS striped pink and
          green ­ SWING OUT over the stage.

          

                                 YOUNG FORCIBLE
                    What a piece of work is man!
                    How noble in reason!

          
          They FLY past each other on their trapezes, double up,
          catch one another hand to ankle. We notice a LARGE PEARL
          RING on Forcible's finger.

          

                                 YOUNG SPINK
                    How infinite in faculty!
                    In form and moving how express and
                    admirable!

          
          In a SUDDEN change of direction, they SWING OUT over the
          audience, trapeze bar LOWERING and PULL CORALINE INTO THE
          AIR! She HOLLERS, terrified.

          
          They expertly TOSS HER one to the other, FLIPPING AND
          SPINNING, as they continue their lines. Her SCREAMS
          become CRIES OF EXHILARATION.

          

                                 YOUNG FORCIBLE
                    In action like an angel!

          

                                 YOUNG SPINK
                    In apprehension how like a god!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ahhh!!!

          

                                 YOUNG FORCIBLE
                    The beauty of the world!

          

                                 YOUNG SPINK
                    The paragon of animals!

          
          Coraline swings face-to-face to the dogs in the royal box
          seats where one licks her.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Yeah!!

          
          The acrobats TOSS CORALINE UP into the air and JACK-KNIFE
          DIVE into the large bucket below. They rise up, unhurt,
          just in time to catch Coraline. The THREE BOW to
          THUNDEROUS THUMPING APPLAUSE and, as the camera pulls
          back on the scene, Other Wybie throws her a rose!

          

          

          EXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - NIGHT


          
          Other Wybie escorts Coraline up the stone stairs from
          Spink and Forcible's apartment. The Other Mother and
          Other Father, a huge, full moon rising behind them, wait
          at the top of the stairs.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Hey there.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Was it wonderful, dear?

          
          Other Mother's hair looks absolutely beautiful and Other
          Father dapper. Coraline shakes with excitement as they
          walk toward the front porch. Other Wybie holds back,
          loses his smile.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me
                    right out of my seat ­ Spink and
                    Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies,
                    that was just a disguise. But then, I was
                    flying through the air and... it was, it
                    was magic.

          
          They walk up the front steps.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (nods, turns back)
                    Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.

          
          Other Father takes Coraline inside. Wybie, at the bottom
          of the steps, looks GUILTY AND SAD. Other Mother glares
          at him, makes a huge, false smile then points to him. He
          just lowers his head.

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You could stay here forever... if you
                    want to.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Really?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Sure...we'll sing and play games, and
                    Mother will cook your favorite meals.

          
          Other Mother rests her hand on Coraline's shoulder.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    There's one tiny little thing we need to
                    do.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    What's that?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Well, it's a surprise.

          

          

          INT. OTHER DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline is seated in her place. The Other Mother places
          a SMALL BOX with a bow in front of her, and takes her
          seat along with Other Father. Coraline excitedly removes
          the lid.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    For you ... our little doll.

          
          The "surprise" is a spool of BLACK THREAD, a SILVER
          NEEDLE, and a pair of SHINY BLACK BUTTONS -- FOR

          CORALINE'S EYES.

          
          Coraline GASPS. She looks up at her Other Parents, hoping
          it's a bad joke.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

                           (SMILING)
                    Black is traditional, but if you'd prefer
                    pink or vermillion or chartreuse...

          
          Coraline sees their button eyes changing colors, growing
          ever more panicked.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    ... though you might make me jealous.

          

                                 CORALINE

                    NO WAY!

          
          She bats the box away, and her hands FLY to her face,
          COVER her eyes.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    YOU'RE NOT SEWING BUTTONS IN MY EYES!

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to
                    stay here.

          
          Other Father tests the needle on his finger.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER

                           (ENTHUSIASTIC)
                    So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww!

          
          Other Mother KICKS him under the table. Embarrassed, he
          puts the needle back in the box.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    There now; it's your decision, darling.
                    We only want what's best for you.

          
          She walks over and puts her hand, now ICY COLD, on
          Coraline's shoulder. Coraline PUSHES it away and STANDS

          UP.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW!

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER

                           (WOUNDED)
                    Bed?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Before dinner?

          
          Coraline fights to control her quaking voice.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm really, really tired. Yeah...
                           (fakes huge yawn)
                    I just need to sleep on things.

          
          Other Mother stands, masking disappointment.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Well of course you do, darling... I'll be
                    happy to tuck you in.

          
          Coraline backs away, urging them to stay where they are.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (palms out, forced smile)
                    Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so
                    much already--

          
          She turns to leave and finds the Other Mother BLOCKING
          THE DOORWAY. Other Father joins her.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    You're welcome. And I ­
                           (smiles to Other Father)
                    we aren't worried at all, darling.

                           (SOFTLY)
                    Soon you'll see things our way.

          
          She lets go. She and the Other Father herd Coraline
          across the hallway to the stairs.

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY, STAIRS, UPPER HALL - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline carefully climbs the stairs, the Other Parents
          watching. When they can no longer see her, she RACES up
          the last steps and DASHES to her Other Bedroom.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - TWILIGHT


          
          Coraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by
          fluttering DRAGONFLIES.

          

                                 MAGIC DRAGONFLY
                    What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to
                    play?

          
          She jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the
          TOY CHEST and tosses them in.

          
          The PLUSH BLUE SQUID greets her from the shelf, followed
          by the TOY TANK GIRAFFE.

          

                                 TOY SQUID
                    Yeah, I wanna hugga your face!

          

                                 TOY TANK GIRAFFE
                    Get a grip, soldier.

          
          She GRABS them both and drops them in the toy chest.

          
          Her PHOTO FRIENDS - NOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS FOR EYES -
          call out from the photo by her bed.

          

                                 PHOTO FRIENDS
                    Hey!

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 1
                    Where's yer buttons, yuper?

          

                                 PHOTO FRIEND 2
                    You wanna stay, don'tcha?

          
          Coraline grabs them as well, drops them in the chest, and
          SHUTS the lid. She barricades the door with a DRESSER and
          CHAIRS and then the TOY CHEST.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm going home tonight, robots - and I
                    won't be back.

          
          She sits on the bed, pulls off the blue boots then CLIMBS
          UNDER THE COVERS, pulling them over her head and holding
          tight. She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must
          fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at
          home. She closes her eyes and tells herself:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go
                    to sleep!

          
          She tosses one way, then another. WE HEAR her voice

          CONTINUE:

          

                                 CORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep...

          
          There are strange, backwards sounds, then the eerie
          voices of Other Mother and Other Father.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
                    There's just one tiny little thing we
                    have to do.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (V.O.)
                    So sharp you won't feel a thing...

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
                    Soon you'll see things our way...

          
          Coraline fidgets and turns and turns again but sleep
          finally wraps her and takes her to oblivion.

          

                                                        MATCH PULLBACK

                                                             DISSOLVE:

          

          

          INT. OTHER BEDROOM - LATER


          
          We see Coraline's room, BRIGHTLY LIT LIKE MORNING IN THE

          REAL WORLD.

          
          ANGLE ON Coraline's face beneath the covers, as she's
          WOKEN by the light. With a hopeful look, she calls out,
          pulls back the covers:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mom!... Dad!..

          
          Her smile turns to shock -- there's a BRIGHT, FULL MOON
          in her window and it's STILL NIGHTTIME IN THE OTHER

          WORLD.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Oh God, I'm still here?

          

          

          INT. OTHER STAIRS, LOWER HALLWAY - SAME


          
          Coraline races downstairs to the Other Living Room where
          the little door home must be! But the living room is
          LOCKED TIGHT. She pulls at the handles, plants a foot and
          tries with all her might! It's no use. She stops,
          panting, then hears a piano note being hit over and over.

          

          

          INT. OTHER FATHER'S STUDY - SAME


          
          Coraline opens the door and finds the Other Father
          sitting at the piano, his back to her, hitting the note.
          She speaks in her bravest voice.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?     I
                    want to go home.

          
          The Other Father turns around. He looks ill; his hair
          messed and his glasses askew. He speaks, his voice slowed-
          down.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    All will be swell, soon as Mother's
                    refreshed. Her strength is our strength.

          
          The WHITE-GLOVED HANDS POP OUT from the piano. One COVERS
          HIS MOUTH, the other WAGS A FINGER in his face.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna
                    find the Other Wybie. He'll help me.

          
          She turns to go.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    No point; he pulled a long face...

          
          He PULLS DOWN the corners of his mouth impossibly far.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    ...and Mother didn't like it.

          
          The PIANO HANDS pop out again, aggressively SHUT HIS
          MOUTH and SPIN HIM away from Coraline. Frightened, she
          runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE - NIGHT, FULL MOON


          
          She runs out the back porch, towards the Other Garden.

          

          OTHER STEEP HILLSIDE TRAIL

          
          She crosses the trail, the Other House in the distance.

          

          ENTRANCE TO OTHER ORCHARD

          
          She runs down the path.

          

          OTHER ORCHARD

          
          Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES

          AND RIPE RED FRUIT.

          
          She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. The
          further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees
          become.

          
          She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.

          

                                 CAT
                    And what do you think you're doing?

          
          The cat trots along by her feet. She blinks.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what
                    I'M doing.

          
          The sky starts to BRIGHTEN and the apple trees become

          WIRE-THIN SHAPES OF TREES.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the
                    old well be here?

          
          The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give
          way to a PALE, EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. No ground or shadows.

          

                                 CAT
                    Nothing out here ... it's the empty part
                    of this world. She only made what she
                    knew would impress you.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But why? Why does she want me?

          
          They walk over the horizon.

          
                                 CAT (cont'd)
                    She wants something to love, I think.
                    Something that isn't her... Or maybe
                    she'd just love something to eat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat
                    daughters!

          

                                 CAT
                    I don't know. How do you taste?

          

          OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS

          
          A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and
          becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat
          slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills,
          white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL

          IN.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Huh? But how can you walk away from
                    something and still come back to it?

          
          The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its
          head to one side.

          

                                 CAT
                    Walk around the world.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Small world.

          
          Coraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a
          shrub.

          

                                   CAT
                    Hang on--

          
          He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE
          KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before
          Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Stop, he's one of the circus mice!

          
          With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse
          into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a
          QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse
          TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He
          drops the rat on the ground.

          

                                 CAT
                    I don't like rats at the best of times,
                    but this one was sounding an alarm.

          
          The cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed,
          Coraline speaks with admiration.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Gooooood kitty.

          
          Coraline looks to the house with a determined look.

          
          On the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the
          UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand.

          

          

          INT. HOUSE,   OTHER HALLWAY - SAME


          
          Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors,
          TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for
          danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of
          anything.

          
          She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS
          with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the
          door swings open into the pitch black living room. The
          hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other
          Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into
          the room.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path,
          blocking the little door, and all around her things start
          to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing
          BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens
          in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The
          radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a
          serving bug.

          
          The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    They say even the proudest --

          
          The sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her
          sitting on it.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    --spirit can be broken ... with love.

          
          She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out
          in a behold my handiwork gesture.

          
          A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the
          Other Mother.

          
          The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like
                    one?

          
          She extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.

          
          Coraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the
          dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing
          she's eaten in the film.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I want to be with my real mom and dad. I
                    want you to let me go.

          
          The Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a
          FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Is that any way to talk to your mother?

          
          Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You aren't my mother.

          
          The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD,
          stare into Coraline's.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    Apologize at once, Coraline!

          
          Coraline stares right back, not blinking.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER

                           (TENSELY)
                    I'll give you to the count of three.
                    One...

          
          Then she stands up, GROWING TALLER.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    ...two...

          
          She grows TALLER STILL and SCARIER like a super model on
          steroids.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER

                    ...THREE!

          
          This TALL OTHER MOTHER GRABS Coraline by her NOSE and
          DRAGS her to the hallway.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ow, what are you doing!

          

          

          INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She PULLS Coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the
          end. Coraline flails at the Tall Other Mother with her
          fists.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ow, that hurts!

          
          Tall Other Mother SHOVES Coraline RIGHT THROUGH THE
          MIRROR as if it was water!

          

          

          INT. CLOSET-PRISON BEHIND THE MIRROR - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline HITS the ground hard. The Tall Other Mother,
          head thrust through the mirror, stares down at her
          angrily.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    You may come out when you've learned to
                    be a loving daughter!

          
          She PULLS HER HEAD OUT and leaves Coraline in DARKNESS.

          
          Coraline pounds on the mirror-door, kicks it with her
          blue boots. A SOB wells up in her throat.

          
          And then we hear a SOFT GHOSTLY MOAN.

          
          She turns. She can just make out a sagging iron bed. When
          the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its
          stained cover.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (FRIGHTENED)
                    Who's there?

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST (O.S.)

                           (WHISPERS)
                    Hush! And shush! For the Beldam might be
                    listening!

          
          Coraline steps towards the bed, the faint glow from under
          the covers in sync with the words she hears.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (WHISPERS)
                    You ... you mean the Other Mother? ...

          
          She gently pulls back the sheets.

          
          The DIMLY GLOWING GHOSTS of THREE CHILDREN, BUTTON EYES,
          SIT UP: a SWEET GIRL GHOST, Coraline's size; a TALL GIRL
          GHOST, emotional; a young BOY GHOST, very sad.

          

                                   CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Who are you?

          

                                 BOY GHOST

                           (WISTFUL)
                    Don't remember our names... But I `member
                    my true mommy...

          
          The boy, dressed like Huck Finn, CONJURES up ghost
          flowers.

          
          The strange-looking flowers wither and fade. He's so sad
          that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Why are you all here?

          

                                  ALL GHOSTS
                    The Beldam!

          
          The ghosts move about in a dance macabre, like ghostly
          fish in water.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    She spied on our lives,
                    through the little doll's eyes,

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    And saw that we weren't    happy.

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    So she lured us away,

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST (CONT'D)
                    with treasures and treats,

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    and games to play!

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    Gave all that we asked -

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    yet we still wanted more -

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    So we let her sew the buttons.

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    She said that she loved us,

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    But she locked us here

          

                                 ALL GHOSTS
                    And ate up our lives.

          
          The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down.
          Coraline is stunned. She thinks a little and then speaks,
          trying to steady her voice.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, she can't keep me in the dark
                    forever; not if she wants to win my life.
                    Beating her is my only chance.

          
          A beat. Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way:

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you
                    could find our eyes?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Has she taken those, too?

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    Yes, miss. And hidden them.

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls
                    will be freed.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I ... I'll try.

          
          The ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against
          the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not
          hopeless.

          
          Suddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER

          OUT!

          

          

          INT. OTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT


          
          C.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the
          hands that hold her. She GRABS one and, FLIPS her MASKED
          ATTACKER onto the ground. She pulls off his mask: it's
          the OTHER WYBIE, his mouth stitched into a PAINFUL, EAR

          TO EAR SMILE.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (PANTING)

                    WYBIE?..

          
          Coraline sits him up.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Did she do this to you?

          
          She unstitches his painfully-huge grin.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I hope that feels bet--

          

                                  OTHER WYBIE
                    Shhh.

          
          He stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the
          Other Living Room, its door UNLOCKED AND OPEN. He grabs
          her hand and PULLS her there.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS


          
          It's dark, the bug furniture asleep. They run to the big
          armoire bug that guards the little door and SHOVE IT out
          of the way. It CRASHES to the floor. And from upstairs, a
          voice calls out.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Coraline? Is that you!

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Let's go!

          
          She opens the little door. A COLD WIND blows from the
          dark passageway, now filled with SPIDER WEBS and the
          SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape.

          

                                  TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Coraline...

          
          The tunnel MOVES at the sound of her voice. Coraline
          takes Other Wybie's arm.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Come on. She'll hurt you again!

          
          He shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal
          a HAND MADE OF SAWDUST. He blows his fingers away.

          
          HIGH HEELS CLICK from the stairs; she's ALMOST THERE!

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Coraline? How dare you disobey your
                    mother!!

          
          Other Wybie shoves Coraline into the tunnel and shuts the
          door.

          

          

          INT. PASSAGEWAY ­ CONTINUOUS


          
          Hunched down, she moves as quickly as she can, tearing
          through the sticky cobwebs.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                           (calling after her)
                    Coraline!

          
          Strands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she
          closes her eyes, hands out until she finally gets to the
          little door at the other end. She DIVES, TUCKS, --

          

          

          INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS TIME, BUT DAY HERE


          
          -- AND ROLLS OUT onto the REAL LIVING ROOM FLOOR.
          Coraline SLAMS the door shut and turns the sharp little
          key ­ still in the keyhole ­ to LOCK IT.

          
          She stands, covered in dust and cobwebs, and calls out
          with joy and relief.

          

                                 CORALINE

                    I'M HOME!

          

          

          INT. HALLWAY, STAIRWAY, DAD'S STUDY - SAME


          
          She goes quickly through the apartment, happily calling:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real
                    Dad ... Real Mom!

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME


          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, Mom's groceries!

          
          There are bags of groceries on the table, as if her
          mother had just gotten in. She pulls open a bag to peek
          and FRUIT FLIES shoot out. The food is spoiled.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (PUZZLED)
                    Uhhh. That's disgusting.

          
          Door bell rings.

          

          

          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She runs excitedly to the door and flings it open.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I missed you guys so much-- You'll never--

          

          INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS, RAIN


          
          But it's just Wybie, the real boy.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh... the Wybie that talks...

          
          He's waves, face down, awkward.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know
                    tha-that old doll I gave you?

          
          Coraline tenses, sharp breath.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    Um... my Gramma's real mad, says it was
                    her sister's - the one that...
                    disappeared?

          
          She reads him like a book.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (REALIZATION)
                    You stole that doll, didn't you?

          
          Wybie answers quickly, guilty as heck.

          

                                 WYBIE.
                    Well, i-it looked just like you. And I

                    FIGURED--

          
          Coraline, rushing the words, tells him the truth.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    It used to look like this pioneer girl;
                    then Huck Finn junior; then it was this
                    Little Rascals chick with all these
                    ribbons, and braids, and....

          
          Her voice trails off. Coraline studies Wybie, then, snaps
          her fingers.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Grandma's missing sister!

          
          He nods, one brow raising up.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I think I just met her. C'mon!

          
          She pulls him inside and--

          

          INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          
          --drags him down the hall.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed

                    TO--

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline WALKS HIM to the LITTLE DOOR in the corner wall
          and points. Wybie looks around anxiously, fearful and
          curious to be in his grandmother's old house.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    She's in there.

          
          Reluctantly, he bends down and reaches for the key in the
          lock.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    C-can you ­ can you unlock it?

          
          She grabs his hand, stops him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Not in a million years. But it wouldn't
                    matter; she can't escape without her
                    eyes. None of the ghosts can.

          
          Wybie stares at her, nodding his head as if he
          understands her crazy story. He changes the subject, gets
          back to his mission.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get
                    that doll?

          
          Coraline snaps at him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Great! I'd love to get rid of it!

          
          She exhales in a huff. Grabs his sleeve, leads him from
          room.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          The doll's not on the bed, not on the chairs or moving
          boxes.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Where are you hiding, you little
                    monster?!

          
          Wybie nervously watches Coraline pull out her dresser
          drawers, yank cushions off the window seat.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    You and Gramma been talking?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The doll's her spy! It's how she watches
                    you, finds out what's wrong with your
                    life!

          
          Wybie, trapped like a deer-in-the-headlights, tries to
          make sense of her remarks.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    The doll...is my Gramma's...spy.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this
                    whole world where everything's better -
                    the food, the garden, the--
                           (leans in on him)
                    --neighbors.

          
          Holds her hands up.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    But it's all a trap!

          
          Wybie, eager to escape, cups hand to ear by the window.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone
                    calling me, Jonesy.

          
          Coraline sees right through him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat!

          
          He moves around her towards the door, turns to leave.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that
                    you couldn't find the doll-- OW!

          
          A blue boot - thrown by Coraline - HITS his arm. He turns
          back as she takes off the second one.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're not LISTENING TO ME!

          

                                 WYBIE
                    That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY!

          
          He FLEES as the second boot flies past. Coraline GROWLS,
          and gives chase.

          

          

          INT UPPER STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

          
          She grabs her boots from the floor, and CHASES him down
          the stairs in her socks.

          

          

          EXT. FRONT DOOR/DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS, RAINING


          
          Door flies open and Wybie RUNS down the front steps to
          his electric bike. Coraline RACES down after him.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    You creep!

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (calling over his shoulder)
                    Crazy!!

          
          He RUNS his bike towards the FALLEN TREE, HOPS ON and
          PEDALS LIKE MAD. As Coraline hurls a boot at him, he GUNS
          the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave
                    me the doll!

          
          Out of breath, she turns away and notices her PARENTS'
          CAR parked to the side.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Mom!   Dad!

          
          Excited, she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the
          car.

          

          

          INT. JONES' CAR - SAME

          Coraline, standing in the rain, excitedly looks through
          the car's window. But the car is EMPTY. She spots her
          mom's PHONE, then opens the door to grabs it and speed
          dial a number.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Pick it up, Dad, pick it up.

          

                                  CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Hi!

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Dad!   Whe-

          

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I'm digging in my garden right now, but
                    leave a message and I'll get right back
                    to you.

          
          She dejectedly looks at the phone, then snaps it shut.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Where have you gone?

          

          

          INT. SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING


          
          Miss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried-
          looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap.

          
          Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside
          her.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Uh... don't you only make wings for the
                    ... dead ones?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't
                    been feeling very well of late.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE (O.S.)
                    April? Aren't you getting ready?

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                           (looks off camera)
                    We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline
                    says her parents have vanished, quite
                    completely.

          
          ANGLE ON Miss Forcible, tightening her elaborate corset
          behind a screen, using pulleys and hooks.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    What?! We've waited months for those
                    tickets.

          
          One of the corset hooks FLIES UP and pulls off her wig.
          She ignores it and comes over to address Spink.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    I suppose we could walk!

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    With your gamy legs? It's nearly two
                    miles to the theater!

          
          Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT, frustrated.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents. We
                    know just what you need. Miriam,
                    get...that's right.

          
          Miss Forcible grabs another dish of old stuck-together
          candy and puts it in front of Coraline.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    How is hundred-year-old candy going to

                    HELP--

          
          Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to
          STAB CORALINE. Coraline yelps, hands up in defense. But
          it's CANDIES she attacks, sending sticky chips flying,
          making loud grunts as she stabs.

          
          She pulls a LARGE, THREE-SIDED CANDY WITH A HOLE IT from
          the rubble and passes it to Coraline.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    There you go, sweety.

          
          Coraline studies the odd candy.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What's it for?

          
          She holds it up, looks through its hole at the ladies.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Well,it might help. They're good for bad
                    things, sometimes.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    No, they're good for lost things.

          
          They don't look any different.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    It's bad things, Miriam.

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost things, April.

          

                                 MISS SPINK
                    Bad.

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    Bad things!

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost.

          

                                  MISS SPINK
                    Bad.

          

                                  MISS FORCIBLE
                    Lost.

          
          Coraline can't take anymore. She gets up, takes the odd
          piece of candy and leaves.

          

          

          INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          
          Coraline, dressed for bed with her blanket over her
          shoulder, walks into her parent's room, the PHOTO of her
          and her parents at the Bear Fountain in the foreground.

          
          She pulls down the bed covers and builds COPIES of her
          parents out of pillows. She fits an extra neck brace on
          one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other.
          Then Coraline lies down and pulls up the covers, very
          sad.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Good-night, Mom. Good-night, Dad.

          
          She kisses them both and BEGINS TO CRY. CAM PUSHES IN.

          

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER


          
          Coraline, asleep. SOMETHING blurs past camera. One paw
          and then two paws bat her nose. She opens her eyes to
          find OPAL BLUE EYES staring at her. It's the BLACK CAT,
          purring loudly.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello. How did you get in?

          
          The cat yawns, his eyes flash.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Do you know where Mom and Dad are?

          
          The cat blinks. Then he heads out the door.

          

          

          INT. LOWER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          She follows him, wrapped in her blanket, to the MIRROR at
          the end of the hallway. The mirror starts to GLOW and
          then an IMAGE FORMS within the glass. It's HER PARENTS!
          They cling together, blue with cold, as snow falls.

          

                                 CORALINE

                    MOM! DAD!!

          
          They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on
          the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U
          S. ­ her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL,
          SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her
          parents. The image fades.

          
          Coraline STRIKES AT THE MIRROR as hard as she can. GLASS
          SHATTERS and she drops to the ground, shaking. The cat
          nuzzles her..

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    How did this happen?

          

          

          INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - SAME


          
          From under the bed, the cat drags out the BUTTON-EYED
          DOLL, REMADE into HER MOTHER on one side, and HER FATHER
          on the other!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    She's taken them.

          
          Coraline, enraged, THROWS the doll. FIRE LIGHT comes up
          on her face as the background DISSOLVES TO:

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM, FRONT OF FIREPLACE - SAME


          
          CLOSE ON DOLL: BURNING in the FIREPLACE.

          
          Coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out. She
          takes a breath and looks up at the mantel.

          
          ANGLE ON snowglobe, the one of the FOUNTAIN BEARS from
          the Detroit Zoo. Coraline cradles it, remembering.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They're not coming back, are they ­ Mom
                    and Dad. Not on their own.

          
          The cat blinks. She looks over at the locked little door
          in the corner wall.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Only one thing to do.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          

          INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM   - CONTINUOUS

          
          Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go.
          Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest,
          her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in
          the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair.
          The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the
          hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then
          sticks it in her bag.

          

          

          INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          We hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to
          reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline.
          She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a
          breath and crawls forward.

          
          The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall.
          The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her.

          

                                 CAT
                    You know, you're walking right into her
                    trap.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I have to go back.

          
          With great feeling, she explains:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    They are my parents.

          

                                 CAT
                    Challenge her then. She may not play
                    fair but she won't refuse. She's got a
                    thing for games.

          
          Coraline thinks about it, remembering.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Hmmm, okay.

          
          The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle
          BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK. Coraline
          tenses when a voice calls out.

          

                                   MOTHER
                    Coraline?

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Mom?

          
          There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue,
          Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in
          her shopping clothes, calls.

          

                                 MOTHER
                    Coraline, you came back for us!

          

                                   CORALINE

                             (RELIEVED)

                    MOM!

          
          She runs forward eagerly and--

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


          
          --out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug
          her real Mom.

          

                                 MOTHER
                    Darling!
                           (voice shifting)
                    Why would you run away from me?

          
          Coraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around
          her. Alarmed, she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow
          into the TALL OTHER MOTHER.

          
          The room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a
          fireplace fire.

          
          Coraline tries her best to be brave.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Where are my parents?

          
          The Tall Other Mother's button eyes GLITTER.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Gosh, I have no idea where your "old"
                    parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored
                    of you and run away to France?

          
          Her teeth gleam.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They weren't bored of me.   You stole
                    them!

          
          Other Father, a FOOT SHORTER than before, his sagging
          face a pale PUMPKIN color, his hair VINES, comes up
          behind Coraline.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a
                    seat, won't you?

          
          Other Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the
          walking bug chair.

          
          The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns
          to it and CLAPS her hands.

          
          A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel -
          FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things -
          carrying the KEY from the real world door.

          
          The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and -
          while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she

          SWALLOWS THE KEY.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (OFFHAND)
                    Why don't you have your own key?

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Only one key.

          
          The Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear,

          SHUTTING HIS MOUTH.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Shhh!

                           (SUNNIER)
                    The garden squash need tending, don't you
                    think, pumpkin?

          
          She turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags
          him out.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Squish squash, pumpkin sauce...

          
          After a beat, Coraline hears the very faint SOUND OF A
          FINGER ON GLASS, just like when her mother wrote HELP on
          the mirror. Coraline jumps to her feet, looking around
          the room for a sign of her real parents.

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (loud whisper)
                    Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you?

          
          A muffled screen door slams O.S. and the Tall Other
          Mother calls to her from the kitchen.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
                    Breakfast-time!

          
          Coraline leaves frame.

          

          

          INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Coraline pauses in the doorway.

          

                                 CORALINE (V.O.)
                           (to herself)
                    Be strong, Coraline.

          
          She sits at the kitchen table in her regular place, her
          back to the sink.

          
          Tall Other Mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom
          omelet and bacon. Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the
          oven.

          
          At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her
          BUTTON EYES with needle and thread. A bead of sweat rolls
          down her forehead. As casually as she can, she asks:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                           (anxious, trying to be cool)
                    Why don't we play ... a game? I know you
                    like them.

          
          The Tall Other Mother's button eyes FLASH.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Everybody likes games.

          

                                    CORALINE

                           (NODS)
                    Uh huh.

          
          Bacon sizzles and spits on the stove.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    What kind of game would it be?

          

                                 CORALINE)
                    An exploring game ... a finding things
                    game.

          
          Other Mother tries to act disinterested, but her fingers
          drum with excitement.

          

                                 OTHER MOTHER
                    And what is it you'd be finding,
                    Coraline?

          
          Coraline hesitates.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    My real parents.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER

                           (DISMISSIVE)
                    Too easy.

          
          She folds the omelet over in the pan.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    And, and the eyes of the ghost children.

          
          Tall Other Mother smiles: now it's getting interesting.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Huh.

          
          The meal ready, she turns from the stove and takes the
          food to Coraline.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    What if you don't find them?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    If I lose, I'll stay here with you
                    forever and let you love me.
                           (indicates button box)
                    And I'll let you sew buttons into my
                    eyes.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Hmmm... And if you somehow win this game?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Then you let me go. You let everyone go ­
                    my real father and mother, the dead
                    children, everyone you've trapped here.

          
          The Tall Other Mother smiles a malicious not in a million
          years smile.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Deal.

          
          She holds out her hand. Coraline doesn't reach.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Not till you give me a clue.

          
          Tall Other Mother snorts, her smile sours. She slowly
          circles Coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very
          stupid child.

          

                                 TALL OTHER MOTHER
                    Oh, right... In each of three wonders
                    I've made just for you, a ghost's eye is
                    lost in plain sight.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    And for my parents?

          
          Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the
          sink - smiles wickedly and just starts TAPPING HER BUTTON
          EYE with her finger nail. Coraline turns away from her.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (SHRUGS)
                    Fine. Don't tell me...

          
          Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    ...it's a deal--

          
          But the Tall Other Mother HAS DISAPPEARED and the tapping
          now is the FAUCET DRIPPING in the sink.

          
          Coraline EXHALES, walks to the sink, stares at the
          dripping faucet.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    What does she mean "wonders?"

          
          Out the kitchen window, the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP,
          answering her question. She FURROWS HER BROWS, thinks
          this was too easy.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hmmm.

          

                                                               CUT TO:

          

          

          EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME


          
          Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the
          garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas
          of glowing flowers.

          
          She passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog
          suddenly SWALLOWS the animal.

          
          She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now
          LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall.

          
          At the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her.
          She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS
          like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS
          sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground,
          spilling her bag.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No!!

          
          They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and
          shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE

          MOUTH.

          
          Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS
          OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she
          is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth.

          
          Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when
          a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't
          attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the
          TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Stop!!

          
          Coraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she
          crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and
          FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the
          ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out.
          She picks up the triangle candy.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Why steal this?

          
          With a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it
          up to her eye and GASPS.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Wow...

          
          EVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing, all
          color gone. She scans the garden, turning slowly. As she
          turns back to where she started, she sees something,
          right in front of her: a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOST'S

          EYE!

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    That must be it.

          
          She lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the
          ghost's eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the
          preying mantis tractor, which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF
          HER with the Other Father, a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN, at its
          controls, his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL

          PIANO HANDS.

          
          HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The
          mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and
          the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She
          yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice:

          

                                 OTHER FATHER
                    Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee.

          
          Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the
          fountains as the tractor moves in.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you.

          
          The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the
          mechanical hands are stronger. It moves onto the bridge -
          STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it.
          Halfway over, it lurches, then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE
          HOLE IT HAS CREATED. The tractor hangs precariously for a
          moment.

          
          Other Father KICKS away one mechanical hand, and with ONE
          HAND FREE, manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB.

          

                                 OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
                    Taaaake it!!!!!

          
          Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the
          tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE

          WATER.

          
          Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire

          GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD.

          
          Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear
          knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary.

          

                                 BOY GHOST
                    Bless you, miss, you found me! But
                    there's two eyes still lost.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it!

          
          Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other
          House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale
          acid green.

          
          Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she
          heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and
          Forcible's show song starts to play...

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE, STAIRWAY TO SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S - SAME


          
          CORALINE'S POV DOWN STAIRWAY: chaser lights circle the
          door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues.

          
          REVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM.

          

          

          INT DOWNSTAIRS THEATRE - SAME

          
          WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears
          behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the
          curtain open. Song stops.

          
          POV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming
          through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on
          the ground.

          
          ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS
          FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive,
          then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and
          startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats.
          One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light
          and shivers.

          
          On stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge,
          wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and
          sandbags.

          
          She cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED
          TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be
          seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY-
          WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming
          from inside the wrapper.

          
          Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper, steels
          herself, then reaches inside. She touches something
          sticky and cold and inhuman. Clenching her teeth, she
          grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD, TAFFY
          HANDS - Young Spink and Forcible's.

          
          Her heart thumps. She PRIES the TAFFY HANDS open like
          scallop shells until a large PEARL-on-a-ring is revealed.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (REALIZING)
                    The pearl!

          
          The hands suddenly GRAB HER! She SCREAMS. Young Spink and
          Forcible, twisted together into one taffy monster, THRUST

          THEIR HEADS FROM THE BAG!

          

                                 TAFFY MONSTER
                    Thief!! Give it back!

          
          Coraline PULLS AWAY, STRETCHING the candy arm out across
          the stage! The taffy monster THRUSTS OUT another paired
          arm, and starts DRAGGING ITSELF TOWARDS CORALINE, ropes
          swaying on pulleys.

          

                                 TAFFY MONSTER (CONT'D)
                           (in unison)
                    You thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Give it
                    back! Thief! Give it back! Give it back!
                    Thief! Stop thief! Thief! Stop!

          
          Coraline, desperate, gets an idea. She clicks on her
          flashlight and aims it at the BAT-DOGS. They GROWL with
          annoyance, OPEN their wings.

          
          The taffy monster is GETTING CLOSER! Coraline hurls the
          flashlight at the bat-dogs and HITS THEM. Angered, they
          TAKE WING TO ATTACK HER - just like she planned!

          
          Bat-dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on
          the right! She waits to the very last second, and then

          DIVES OUT OF THE WAY!

          
          BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE! Coraline's hand is
          released by the taffy hands, leaving her the PEARL. The
          bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as-
          stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and
          theater.

          
          The PEARL in Coraline's hand PULSES BLUE.

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST (V.O.)
                    Hurry on, girl - her web is unwinding!

          
          Coraline nods, sticks the pearl in her bag, and looks up
          towards the ceiling and beyond.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE/OTHER BOBINSKY'S BALCONY - SAME


          
          CORALINE'S MOVING POV, on lower ext stairs to UP ANGLE ON
          BALCONY. We hear haunting circus music in the air.

          
          Other Mr. B's Russian flag, TORN in places, waves in the
          air. The pale green moon is nearly HALF-ECLIPSED now with
          what is clearly the SHADOW OF A HUGE, DARK, BUTTON.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE as she climbs the last flight of stairs
          to Bobinsky's. She stops with a SHUDDER at the top. The
          flag has been replaced with the EMPTY COAT OF OTHER WYBIE-
          gloves, pants and sneakers pinned on - hanging like old
          laundry.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Oh, Wybie...

          
          She takes a breath, leans out over the railing and
          shouts.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    EVIL WITCH ... I'M NOT SCARED!

          
          The door behind her CREAKS open. Coraline shivers - she
          is definitely scared.

          

          

          INT. OTHER MR. B'S ATTIC FLAT - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the
          door. The cannons and Ferris wheel are dark and quiet;
          the circus tent glows dimly. Pale green moonlight shines
          in patches through holes in the roof. The corners and
          edges of the room are very dark.

          
          OTHER BOBINSKY suddenly CRAWLS by the door behind her.
          Coraline whips around, on guard. He LOOMS UP past the
          cannons on her right, leaning towards her.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    Hello, ga-LOO-boo-shka.

          
          There are too many joints in his arms and legs.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm Coraline.

          
          His tall, crooked hat is pulled so low, and his collar so
          high, that his face is completely hidden.

          
          He throws out his arm towards her and the CIRCUS BALL
          from the mouse circus rolls from his sleeve to his hand.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    Is dis vhat you're looking for?

          
          She looks through the hole of the triangle candy and sees
          an AMBER GLOW ­ the THIRD GHOST'S EYE!

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Uh-huh.

          
          She grabs for it, but he's too quick. He back-bends to
          all fours and SCUTTLES around her towards the back
          shadows.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    You tink vinning game is goot ting?

          
          Coraline holds up the triangle candy, scans the room for
          him. His voice sounds distorted now.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)

                                 (CONT'D)
                    You'll just go home and be bored and
                    neglected...

          
          WE SEE him twine up a post behind Coraline, crawl out on
          a beam...

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

          He SWINGS UPSIDE-DOWN from his ankles, his head stopping
          right by Coraline's. She whips around, alarmed.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

                    and laugh vis you.

          
          He DROPS to the floor on his head, then SLITHERS into the
          circus tent. Coraline does not want to follow him. But
          she does.

          

          

          INT. CIRCUS TENT - CONTINUOUS


          
          The Other Mr. B is perched on a pile of MOLDY CHEESES in
          the center of the ring. He moves like all his bones are
          broken.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    If you stay here, you can have vhatever

          Coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the
          AMBER GLOW coming from inside his hat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You don't get it, do you?

          
          She moves closer.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                    I don't understand.

          
          Small forms MOVE under the back of his coat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Of course you don't understand. You're
                    just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.

          

                                 OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
                           (last breath)
                    Not even that anymore.

          
          Coraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE
          PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball. It barks
          at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar.

          
          RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls
          back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around
          for the circus ball.

          
          There's a rat bark behind her and she turns. The HUGE RAT
          - balanced on a wheel of cheese, circus ball in paws -
          TAUNTS HER, then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR! She GIVES

          CHASE.

          

          

          INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS


          
          The OTHER RATS RACE behind the twin rows of cannons - the
          cheese wheel rat rolls through them, heading towards the
          door!

          
          Coraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE
          COTTON CANDY at her. She's HIT in the side, her leg, her
          ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like
          punches.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Ahhh! No!!

          
          A PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel -
          appears in the front door as the rat approaches.

          
          Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE-

          WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE.

          
          Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as
          hard as she can AT THE RAT.

          
          The whistling candy FLIES through the pet door towards
          the RAT, just outside.

          The RAT DUCKS, the CANDY MISSES, and the cheese-wheel rat
          ESCAPES down the stairs with the ball.

          Coraline, lurching forward, HOLLERS.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    NOOOO!

          
          Two waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and
          TRIP her. She CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND--.

          

          

          EXT. OTHER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


          
          --OUT onto the balcony which TEARS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
          with ATTACHED STAIRWAY.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Noooo!

          
          The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it
          collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the
          house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment.

          
          WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and
          knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white
          gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and
          circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost
          eye.

          
          Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light,
          turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the

          DARK BUTTON SHADOW.

          
          Her HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her
          knee. She feels nothing but COLD LOSS.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                           (DEVASTATED)
                    Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost
                    everything.

          
          She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest. The band of light
          that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone.

          
          In the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat -
          CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust
          leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the
          eclipse paused.

          
          There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up.

          
          Across from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT,
          licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet.

          

                                 CAT
                    I think I mentioned that I don't like
                    rats at the best of times.

          
          Coraline smiles, walks towards him.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think you might have said something
                    like that.

          

                                 CAT
                    It looked like you needed this one,
                    however.

          
          He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline.

          
          She picks it up , sticks it in her bag. Around her, the

          YARD, HOUSE, TREES, SHRUBS AND DRIVEWAY TURN ASHEN GRAY.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Thank you.

          
          Looks towards house.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I'm heading inside. I still have to find
                    my parents.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          
          ANGLE ON MOON. The stalled eclipse STARTS AGAIN, and in
          one beat, the last sliver of green moon is FULLY BLACKED
          OUT. The EDGES of the button shadow start to FLAKE AWAY.

          
          ON CORALINE WITH CAT. A strange insect thrumming has
          begun. What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of
          paper are falling. Confused, she looks up to see:.

          
          The huge button shadow is EATEN TO NOTHING and then the
          SKY around it IS EATEN AS WELL, revealing dirty white
          light. The destruction TRAVELS from sky to the distant
          hills, the sound of a million, invisible locusts growing
          louder.

          
          UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE. The cat hisses. Deeply
          alarmed, they look from one direction to another.

          
          POV out front yard. The destruction TRAVELS up the
          driveway, PULLS APART the poplars, and then UNRAVELS the
          topiary elephant and bird.

          
          DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat, his TAIL TWITCHING. WE
          PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY

          SHRINKING ISLAND!

          
          NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their
          feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat
          makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the
          movie!

          
          Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her
          guardian angel.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Come on, quickly!

          
          The cat LEAPS and she catches him, then CARRIES HIM up
          the DISINTEGRATING porch steps to the front door. She
          gets through just in time, and SLAMS it shut!

          

          

          INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME


          
          It's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and
          intermittent vibrations. A poisonous green light spills
          from the other living room.

          
          Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder,
          past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes, to the room
          where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on
          glass.

          

          

          INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          A poisonous GREEN FIRE - LIKE SLEEPY SEA SNAKES - BURNS
          in the fireplace. The bug furniture looks grey now, their
          lights flickering as if short-circuited; legs and wings
          twitching uncontrollably.

          
          Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign
          of her parents.

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground. She senses the Other
          Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at
          all but a witch, a Beldam. She turns.

          
          The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    So, you're back....

          
          Her voice sounds dry and tired. She turns her face
          towards Coraline. It is a WHITE DEATH MASK, cracked and
          peeling - her true face.

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    And you brought vermin with you.

          
          Coraline shudders and steps back. The cat makes a fearful
          sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No, I ... I brought a friend.

          
          The Beldam rises up 12 FEET TALL. She is WITHERED to the
          bone; with plate-like shoulders and hips; her bustle now
          an arachnid's tail section. Her true form.

          
          She reaches her long, sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to
          Coraline's face.

          

                                 BELDAM

                           (FLATLY)
                    You know I love you.

          
          Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You, you have a very funny way of showing
                    it.

          
          The Beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand
          outstretched.

          

                                    BELDAM
                    So?     Where are they - the ghost eyes?

          
          Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and
          starts to hand them over. But she catches herself.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Hold on.

          
          And pulls back.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    We aren't finished yet, are we?

          
          The Beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    No, I suppose not. After all, you still
                    need to find your old parents, don't you?
                    Too bad you won't have this.

          
          She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and
          FLINGS it into the green fire. The Beldam laughs while
          the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops.

          
          ON CORALINE. The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT
          in her hand. Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST (O.S.)
                    Be clever, miss; even if you win she'll
                    never let you go!

          
          Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the
          armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam
          to unlock it! She furrows her brow as an idea comes to
          her then nods.

          
          She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she
          can muster, says:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I already know where you've hidden them.

          
          The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and
          sceptical.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    Well... produce them.

          
          Coraline points to the little door.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    They're behind that door.

          
          The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and
          speaks very quietly.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    Oh, they are, are they?

          
          A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS
          TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way,
          as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the
          armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.

          
          Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on
          wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming
          from?!

          
          The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES
          SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --

          

                                 CAT
                    There!

          
          -- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -

          OPAQUE WITH FROST.

          
          C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass
          is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see
          the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED
          PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back
          from them.

          

                                  CORALINE

                            (WHISPERING)
                    Mom.   Dad!

          
          ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's
          discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns
          to Coraline, expectantly.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all
                    right.

          
          The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns
          it, leaves the key in place.

          
          She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song
          voice.

          

                                 BELDAM
                    You're wrong, Coraline!

          
          She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider-
          web tunnel.

          
          ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat -
          obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's
          thinking very hard.

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)

                           (PITYING)
                    They aren't there.

          
          She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK
          BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the
          Beldam softly gloats:

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    Now you're going to stay here forever.

          
          Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the
          fury she can.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    No ... I'm ...

          
          She GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER

          HEAD.

          

                                  CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    NOT!

          
          And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL -
          face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and
          lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD.

          
          FREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the
          shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little
          door.

          
          Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside,
          stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door
          from the other side.

          
          The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A
          BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO

          SHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES!

          
          ANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug.

          
          ON BELDAM, hands covering her face.

          

                                  BELDAM

                    NOOOOOOOOO!

          
          Her hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN

          THREAD!

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    You horrible cheating girl!

          
          She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral
          of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center.
          A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR!

          
          The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT.
          There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS.

          
          The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture
          straight to the little door and disappears into the
          tunnel.

          
          Coraline falls the very bottom of the web.

          
          Fifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS
          DOWN like a huge, flying spider!

          
          Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the
          trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS.

          
          The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around,
          grasping blindly.

          

                                 BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    Noo!! Where are you? You selfish brat!!

          
          Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE
          DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room.
          She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS
          CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks
          free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB

          TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM.

          

                                  BELDAM (CONT'D)
                    Hahahaha...

          
          The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now!

          
          Coraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS

          COMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST!

          

                                 BELDAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                    YOU ... DARE ...

          

          

          INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and
          grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the

          BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE.

          

                                 BELDAM

                    ... DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER??!!

          
          Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The
          cat takes off down the tunnel.

          
          Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB
          HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN!

          

                                 CORALINE

                    PLEASE...SHUT!!

          
          The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT
          FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip
          the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED.

          
          The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY
          at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one
          thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the
          Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then
          SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the
          ground!

          
          She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement!

          
          Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when
          it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming
          through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped
          down, as fast as she can.

          
          The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing.

          

                                 BELDAM (O.S.)

                    DON'T LEAVE ME! DON'T LEAVE ME!!! I'LL

                    DIE WITHOUT YOU!!!!

          
          And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW
          SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far
          door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side

          STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER!

          
          Ahead, DAYLIGHT APPEARS, and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE

          REAL WORLD!

          

          

          INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND
          LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split-
          second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A
          CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door
          and lock, hold. It's over...

          
          Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's
          ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows
          a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first
          since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue
          with white clouds.

          
          She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the
          ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside.

          
          She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes
          and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE!

          
          She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her
          hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny
          bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She
          looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE.
          She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and
          neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside.

          
          As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe,
          Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does
          this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY
          REAL MOTHER calls to her.

          

                                 MEL (O.S.)
                    Coraline? We're home!

          
          Her TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway, a
          dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!

          
          Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around
          them.

          

                                   MEL
                    Missed us?

          
          C.U. ON CORALINE. Huh?

          
          Mel notices the broken snow globe.

          

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                    Oh no, you broke my favorite snow globe.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I didn't break it. It must've broke when
                    you escaped.

          
          Mom spots her bloody knee.

          

                                 MEL
                    And cut your knee.

          
          Charlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Coraline, I asked you to count all the
                    windows, not put your knee through them.

          

                                   CORALINE

                    BUT-

          
          Mel tells her.

          

                                 MEL
                    Well, get yourself cleaned up,

                           (WARMS)
                    we're going out tonight.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    We gotta lot to celebrate!

          
          Coraline, confused, takes a stab.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're talking about... your garden
                    catalog?

          

                                 MEL
                    Of course! What else?

          
          Her parents turn to leave the room.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But look at the snow on your clothes...?

          
          But the snow melts without a trace.

          

                                 MEL

                           (CONFUSED)
                    What's gotten into you, Coraline?

          
          Her parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and
          looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She
          cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room.

          

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT HOUSE - NIGHT, SKY CLEAR

          
          The VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as
          light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR
          Charlie make a strangled sound.

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FULL MOON RISING


          
          Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED,
          wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string
          around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night
          sky.

          
          Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's
          an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the
          bed. Coraline LAUGHS.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    So, gonna order the tulips?

          
          He opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this.

          

                                   CHARLIE
                    What's that?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    For the garden party!!

          
          He sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the
          squid.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    I have no idea what you're talking about.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Dad!

          
          She turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the
                    invitations.

          
          Her mother nods, points up.

          

                                 MEL
                    Even Bobinsky?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's
                    just...eccentric.

          
          Charlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Good night, Coraline.

          
          As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers
          next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so"
          look, and she and Charlie leave the room.

          
          Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the
          GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to
          admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, hello again.

          
          She walks over to the window, opens it.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    You still mad?

          
          His expression says yes, he's still mad.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the
                    Other Mother? ­ it was all I could think
                    of.

          
          The cat's angry expression softens. He rests his head on
          her hand, licking her fingers and purrs.

          
          Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and
          carries him over to her bed.

          
          She grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large
          PEARL, the CIRCUS BALL, and the GREY STICKSHIFT KNOB. She
          holds them out to the cat.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's time, don't you? To set them
                    free?

          
          The cat nods. She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow
          and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her. The two
          of them close their eyes, and in no time at all, they
          doze off to sleep. WE SLOWLY TILT UP.

          

                                             MATCH MOVE DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. DREAMSCAPE - MAGIC TIME


          
          A MAGIC ART SKY animates subtly.

          
          CAM TILT DOWN ON Coraline, studying sky, her back to us.
          From behind CAM, CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to
          shine on her. She turns toward us, shielding her eyes.

          
          Coraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE
          GHOST CHILDREN, now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS; EYES
          RESTORED, small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    It's a fine, fine thing you did for us,
                    miss.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Well, I'm glad it's finally over!

          
          A SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children. They
          gather around Coraline and bow their heads.

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST

                           (SIGHS)
                    It is over and done with ... for us.

          
          Silent beat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What about...me?

          
          The tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably, then BLURTS

          OUT:

          

                                 TALL GIRL GHOST
                    You're in terrible danger, girl!

          
          Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    But how?   I locked the door!?

          

                                 SWEET GIRL GHOST
                    It's the key, miss, there's only one and
                    the Beldam will find it.

          
          The KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out
          in front of Coraline. She grabs it.

          
          The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly.

          

                                 BOY GHOST

                           (WHISPERS)
                    Tain't all bad, miss. Thou art alive ...
                    thou art still ... living...

          
          They begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and
          faster. Coraline starts to turn and then she --

          

                                                               CUT TO:

          

          

          INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          

          -- ROLLS HERSELF AWAKE IN HER OWN BED. FAST PULL BACK
          above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by
          her side.

          
          Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES
          ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the
          key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice

          PANICKED:

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s-
                    somewhere she can never ...

          
          The cat doesn't like the sound of this. Coraline grabs
          her blanket and heads to her door. But the cat leaps down
          and blocks her way.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Outta my way!

          
          She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room. The cat glares
          after her

          

          INT. HOUSE STAIRWAY, LOWER HALL, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads
          down the hall. She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits
          frame. CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE
          DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.

          WE ROCKET IN AND--

          

                                                         JUMP CUT TO:

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE. Through the narrow gap at
          the door's bottom, the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM
          CRAWLS OUT. It scrambles out of frame in the direction of
          Coraline!

          

          

          EXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME

          
          Coraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY
          that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like
          fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her
          father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl,
                    I think you are so nice ...

          

          

          EXT. ORCHARD - SAME


          
          She moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with
          BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    ... I give you bowls of porridge
                    And I give you bowls of ice cream.

          
          LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND
          drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I give you lots of kisses,
                    And I give you lots of hugs ...

          

          

          EXT. WELL - SAME


          
          Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the
          well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    ... But I never give you sandwiches
                    With grease and worms and mung beans.

          
          Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS
          behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer.

          
          Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one
          side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating,
          she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's
          around her neck.

          
          The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS

          HER!

          
          Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.

          
          The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the
          air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!

          
          Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught
          between the key string and her neck!

          
          The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the

          LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION!

          
          A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN
          SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his
          own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining
          electric bike!

          

                                  WYBIE

                    YAHHHHH!!!!

          
          Wybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the
          confused HAND with his slug tongs!

          
          He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to
          throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his
          handlebars.

          
          OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND
          HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just
          manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand,
          caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and
          face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS
          FINGERS to make him fall!

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)

                           (STRUGGLING)
                    Get off!!

          
          Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her
          BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the
          crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND.
          It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it.
          The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It
          crouches to attack her!

          
          And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG
          ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE
          LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.

          
          Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing
          hard - removes the key and string from around her sore
          neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the
          needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together
          with the string. The key is left attached.

          
          The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and
          DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam,
          they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in
          the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover
          in place.

          
          Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his
          injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He
          looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little
          with moonlight.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you
                    about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline.

          
          Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath,
          stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the
          first time.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Why did you change your mind?

          
          He walks over, and takes out an old B&W photo from his
          jacket.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    W-well, Gramma showed me this picture,
                    after I called you crazy?

          
          He hands it to her.

          
          ANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed
          in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink
          Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks
          just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH
          BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her.

          

                                 WYBIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                    It's her and her sister, before she
                    disappeared.

          
          ANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE. Behind them, blossoms fall
          like snow in the orchard.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    The sweet ghost girl.

          
          Wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the
          distance.

          

                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne!   Come home!!

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (re: his grandmother)
                    Oh, man...what am I going to tell her?

          
          She looks up from the photo and smiles.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Just bring her by the house tomorrow.      We
                    can tell her together.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    We...we can??

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk
                    me.

          
          She gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and LAUGHS.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Wasn't my idea.

          
          The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS.
          Coraline smiles.

          
          We TILT UP to the sky and see the last ropey clouds -
          like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright
          gibbous moon.

          

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY

          
          One WHITE BALLOON floats against a blue sky with puffy,
          white clouds. WE TILT DOWN past more balloons to a TABLE
          OF REFRESHMENTS, set up by the front gates.

          
          Coraline picks up a TRAY OF DRINKS and heads out to her
          hard-working GUESTS, all wearing garden gloves and
          showing signs of having helped plant about TWO HUNDRED

          RED TULIPS.

          
          SPINK AND FORCIBLE, along with their DOGS, are set up at
          a table below the steps. Empty plant cartons are stacked
          nearby along with some garden tools and empty bags of
          peat moss.

          

                                    CORALINE
                       Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss
                       Forcible.

          

                                    MISS FORCIBLE
                              (straining to see)
                       Oh, look April - Pink Ladies!

          

                                    CORALINE
                       Actually, it's just lemonade.

          
          Coraline hands them the beverages, then nods towards the
          GREY DOG digging in the flowers.

          

                                    CORALINE (CONT'D)
                       How's Angus doing?

          
          Miss Spink sighs.

          

                                    MISS SPINK
                       Oh, much better, dear... But he can't
                       duck his wings forever!

          
          Coraline heads up the steps to find her PARENTS dumping a
          heavy bag of PEAT MOSS around the dead-looking tree in
          the stone circle.

          

                                    CHARLIE
                       Here comes a burp.

          
          Charlie BURPS.

          

                                    MEL

                              (SCOLDING)
                       Charlie!

          

                                    CHARLIE
                       Oh, excu-say-moi, but that pizza was
                       delicious.

          
          Mel SIGHS.

          

                                      CORALINE
                       Cold drinks?

          
          Charlie nods, grabs them for Mel and Wybie.

          

                                 CHARLIE

                           (HAPPILY)
                    Oh yeah, great!

          

                                 MEL

                           (SKEPTICAL)
                    You were right, Coraline. I really hate
                    dirt, but the tulips look nice.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    Thanks, mom.

          
          Coraline, delighted, moves on.

          
          Coraline comes upon Bobinsky in the bottom of the drained
          fish pond. He's stealthily PULLING just-planted tulips
          from the dirt there, and putting BEETS in their place.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)
                           (pulling beets)
                    Ooo, dret nican...neit, neit...da, da, dat iz
                    possible.

          
          Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT to get his attention.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    How are the meeshkas, Mr. B?

          
          Surprised and looking very guilty, he tries to cover up
          his activities. She smiles and hands him a drink.

          

                                 MR.   BOBINSKY

                           (SMILES)
                    Dey tell me that   you - are saviour,

                    performance.

          
          He drains his glass of lemonade. A familiar voice is
          heard approaching. Coraline turns and smiles.

          

                                 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne, I know where I'm going--

          
          ANGLE ON Wybie and his GRANDMOTHER as they walk through
          the garden gates

          

                                 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER

                                 (CONT'D)
                    --I grew up here.

          
          Coraline sees them and waves.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Welcome, Ms. Lovat!

          
          The old lady looks up and smiles.

          

                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER
                    Oh, hello.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I'm Coraline Jones -- I've got so much to
                    tell you!

          

                                  MEL (O.C.)
                            (background dialog)
                    Here.

          

                                 CHARLIE (O.C.)
                           (background dialog)
                    Thanks.

          

                                 MISS SPINK (O.C.)
                           (background dialog)
                    Ooo, do you want to pop a little gin in
                    it dear?

          

                                 MISS FORCIBLE (O.C.)
                           (background dialog)
                    Of course!

          
          CAMERA PULLS UP from the GARDEN, FLIES OVER THE HOUSE and
          BOOMS DOWN to the PINK PALACE APARTMENTS SIGN out front.
          On top of the sign sits the black cat, who looks right
          into camera, blinks, then walks behind the thin post that
          holds the sign and DISAPPEARS.

          

                                   THE END

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
the village.  One of the men recognizes him.

				WORKER
		Master Li is here!

ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.

In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.

INT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY

Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls.

				AUNT WU
		Shu Lien!

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing
for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen
wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in.

				AUNT WU
		Li Mu Bai is here!

INT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY

				LI
		How's everything?

				AUNT WU
		Fine.  Please come in.

Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in.  Li carries a
large object, wrapped in silk.

Yu smiles.

				YU
		Mu Bai...It's been too long.

				LI
		It has.
			(he glances around
			the room)
		How's business?

				YU
		Good.  And how are you?

				LI
		Fine.

An awkward pause.

				YU
		Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan
		Mountain.  He said you were
		practicing deep meditation.

				LI
		Yes.

				YU
		The mountain must be so peaceful...
		I envy you.  My work keeps me so
		busy, I hardly get any rest.

				LI
		I left the training early.

				YU
		Why?  You're a Wudan fighter.
		Training is everything.

				LI
		During my meditation training... I
		came to a place of deep silence...
		I was surrounded by light... Time
		and space disappeared.  I had come
		to a place my master had never told
		me about.

				YU
		You were enlightened?

				LI
		No.  I didn't feel the bliss of
		enlightenment.  Instead... I was
		surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I
		couldn't bear it.  I broke off my
		meditation.  I couldn't go on.
		There was something... pulling me
		back.

				YU
		What was it?

				LI
		Something I can't let go of.  You
		are leaving soon?

				YU
		We're preparing a convoy for a
		delivery to Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
		something to Sir Te for me.

Li unwraps the object.  It is an ancient, astonishingly
beautiful sword.

				YU
		The Green Destiny Sword?  You're
		giving it to Sir Te?

				LI
		I am.  He has always been our
		greatest protector.

				YU
		I don't understand.  How can you
		part with it?  It has always been
		with you.

				LI
		Too many men have died at its edge.
		It only looks pure because blood
		washes so easily from its blade.

				YU
		You use it justly, you're worthy of
		it.

				LI
		It's time for me to leave it behind.

				YU
		So what will you do now?

Li doesn't reply.

				YU
		Come with me to Peking.  You can
		give the sword to Sir Te yourself.
		It'll be just like old times.

				LI
		First I must visit my master's
		grave.  It's been many years since
		Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet
		to avenge his death.  And yet I'm
		thinking of quitting.  I must pray
		for his forgiveness.

				YU
		Join me once you have finished.  I
		can wait for you in Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps.

EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY

Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
boundaries of Peking.  Yu, riding a handsome horse and
clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.

				GUARDS
		Ok.  Pass.

				YU
		Thanks.  Let's go into the city.

EXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY

Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
medicinal herbs.

				GIAO
		Everything got here safely.  I'm
		much obliged.

				YU
		Just doing my job.

				GIAO
		Sun Security has been the best
		since your father started it.
		You're a credit to his memory.

				YU
		Thank you.

				GIAO
		I mean it.

EXT. DAY. PEKING

From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
the morning sun.

EXT. PEKING STREET. DAY

Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
are fighting to get through the boulevards.

A group of jugglers perform at a corner.

Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Yu presents the sword to Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		This is Li's personal sword, a
		great hero's weapon!  He is the
		only one in the world worthy of
		carrying it.  It's too fine a gift.
		I cannot accept it.

				YU
		Sir Te!  It has brought him as much
		trouble as glory.  Help him to
		leave these troubles behind.
		Otherwise, he'll never be able to
		start anew.

				SIR TE
		All right.  I'll act as the sword's
		custodian.

De Lu, the head servant, enters.

				DE LU
		Governor Yu has arrived.

				SIR TE
		I must change.

				YU
			(getting up)
		You've always been so good to Li Mu
		Bai and me.  Please accept our
		thanks.

				SIR TE
		Please do not be such a stranger.
		You'll stay the night as my guest.
		Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.
		And forgive me for prying.  Your
		father was a great friend to me,
		and I think of you as my own
		daughter.

				YU
		Please, Sir Te, what is it?

				SIR TE
		Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and
		his warrior days... maybe he's
		trying to tell you something?

				YU
		I don't know...

				SIR TE
		Don't be coy.  I've always known
		about your feelings for each other.
		All these years, it's a shame...
		neither of you is brave enough to
		admit the truth to the other.
		You're both wasting precious time.

				YU
		I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I
		aren't cowards.

				SIR TE
		When it comes to emotions, even
		great heroes can be idiots.  Tell
		me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
		the next time you see him.  I'll
		give him an earful!

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu and De Lu approach the study.

				DE LU
		Sir Te said to leave the sword in
		here.

De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
inside.  The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
hanging on the walls.

				DE LU
		Who are you?

				JEN
		I'm your guest today.  I am Governor
		Yu's daughter.

				DE LU
		This is Sir Te's study.  You are
		here to...

				JEN
		I was looking for a quiet corner.

				DE LU
		I am Sir Te's head servant.  And
		this is another of our guests.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.

				JEN
		It's heavy for such a thin piece of
		metal!

				YU
		The handle is heavy.  And the blade
		is no ordinary metal.  Still, the
		sword is the lightest of weapons.
		You're just not used to handling it.

				JEN
		But I have had much practice.  As a
		child in the West, a platoon lived
		with us.  They'd let me play with
		their weapons.  The scabbard is so
		beautiful.

				YU
		Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you
		see it tainted with blood, its
		beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400
		years old.

				JEN
		Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...

				YU
		My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it
		to Sir Te as a gift.

				JEN
		Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?
		Why would he give his sword to Sir
		Te?

				YU
		You're too young to understand.

				JEN
		You're a sword fighter too?

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath.  An eerie sound
resonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed.

				YU
		Yes, I am.  But I prefer the
		machete.  Certain moves, however,
		call for a sword.

				JEN
		Really?

Yu puts the sword back in the case.

				JEN
			(longingly)
		It must be exciting to be a fighter,
		to be totally free!

				YU
		Fighters have rules too: friendship,
		trust, integrity... Without rules,
		we wouldn't survive for long.

				JEN
		I've read all about people like you.
		Roaming wild, beating up anyone who
		gets in your way!

				YU
		Writers wouldn't sell many books if
		they told how it really is.

				JEN
		But you're just like the characters
		in the stories.

				YU
		Sure.  No place to bathe for days,
		sleeping in flea-infested beds...
		They tell you all about that in
		those books?

				JEN
		You know what I mean.  I'm getting
		married soon, but I haven't lived
		the life I want.

				YU
		So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's
		the most important step in a
		woman's life, isn't it?

				JEN
		You're not married, are you?

				YU
		What do you think?

				JEN
		No!  You couldn't roam around
		freely if you were.

				YU
		You're probably right.

Yu studies Jen.  The room falls silent for a moment.

EXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY

It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.  Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid.  She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye.  Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.

EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Two lighted lanterns are raised up.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.

				SIR TE
		Go ahead, Governor Yu.

Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword.  He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.
Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword
out from its sheath.  The sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark.

				SIR TE
		Two feet 9 inches long.  1 inch
		wide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,
		2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of
		an inch thick.  With seven rubies
		missing from the hilt.  You can
		tell the design dates back to
		before the Chin era.  Engraved with
		a technique lost by the time of the
		Han Dynasty.

				GOVERNOR YU
		Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		A sword by itself rules nothing.
		It comes alive only through skillful
		manipulation.

				GOVERNOR YU
		I see your point.  Please continue.

				SIR TE
		The Imperial Court isn't the
		problem.  With royalty and officials
		everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
		security tight.  But Peking is not
		like the West.  Here, you'll find
		all sorts of characters.  Proceed
		with caution in your quest for law
		and order.  Don't depend only on
		the court.  Contacts in the Giang
		Hu underworld can ensure your
		position.  Be strong, yet supple.
		This is the way to rule.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then
walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings.  Someone
knocks and the maid goes to answer the door.

				MAID
		Governess...

				GOVERNESS
		Let me do it.

The maid leaves as the governess enters the room.

				JEN
		Please sit.

				GOVERNESS
		I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you
		want to change into them?

				JEN
		Put them down.

				GOVERNESS
		I heard you met Shu Lien today.

				JEN
		Do you know her?

				GOVERNESS
		She's one of those.  Your mother
		would not want you consorting with
		her kind.

Jen shoots her an angry look.

				JEN
		I'll socialize with whomever I
		please.

				GOVERNESS
		Don't invite danger into your
		father's house.

She's about to say something, then thinks better of it.

				JEN
		I'm tired now.

				GOVERNESS
		Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up,
		and is getting married soon.  God
		knows what the future will bring.

				JEN
		It will be just the same.  Enough!
		I'm tired.

				GOVERNESS
		Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the
		windows for you.

The governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed,
thinking.

EXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

A wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo,
Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene.

				MASTER BO
		Chilly, eh?

				NIGHTMAN
		Yes, Master Bo.

As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.

EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
wraps the sword.

Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The
thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to
stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
roof as Bo yells out.

				BO
		Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on
		the roof!  The sword's been stolen!
		Stop thief!  Stop him!

The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.

Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
people to the theft.  People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
them.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

Bo runs through the streets.  The thief is nowhere in sight.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.  Bo hurries
towards the source.

EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.

				TSAI
		It's Jade Fox!

				MAY
		We must avenge mother!

The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
a wall, just as Bo arrives.

				BO
		Do something!  He's getting away!

EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.  Yu and the
hooded figure face off.

				YU
		Return the sword, and I'll let you
		go.

The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.

Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.

				YU
		You've been trained at Wudan?

The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.  Yu
catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
of lightning-quick blows.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.

				TSAI
		You're mistaken.  We're just street
		performers.  We were rehearsing.

				MAY
		Father!

				BO
		You were rehearsing?  Who are you
		trying to fool?

May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.  They run
off.

				BO
		Where did that thief go?

Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
Governor Yu's compound.

				BO
		Governor Yu's house!

EXT. ROOF TOP

Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.

				YU
		Get down here!  Give back the sword!

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT

Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
to get away.

Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
empty courtyard.

EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.

				DE LU
		Sir Te awaits you.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Men are standing at attention.  Bo is giving his account of
what happened, as Yu enters.

				BO
		I'm sure the thief is in the Yu
		household.

				SIR TE
		How dare you imply?

				BO
		But I say --

				SIR TE
		-- Enough.

The men hustle out.  Bo can barely contain his frustration.

				YU
		Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

				SIR TE
		Yes, though I doubt he's involved
		in this.

				YU
		But the sword could be in his
		compound.

				SIR TE
		Then someone's trying to set him up.
		We should inform Li Mu Bai.

EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Madam Yu is returning from temple.  The governess is helping
her out of the carriage.  Servants are peeling bills off a
wall across the street.

				MADAM YU
		What is it?

				MAID
		Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
escape justice!" is seen on the ground.

				MADAM YU
		Let me see.

				GOVERNESS
		Someone is after Jade Fox.
		Preposterous, looking for her here!

Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
flyer away and follows her.

A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu.  She studies it,
then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Bo is searching for the Tsais.  The bridge is full of
jugglers.  But the two are nowhere to be found.

EXT. PEKING STREET - DAY

Bo quizzes a homeless man.

				BO
		Where are they?

				HOMELESS MAN
		I don't know.  I haven't seen them
		in two days.

Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
quickly into an alley.  Bo follows her.

EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE

May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
down bamboo fence.  Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
oiling their weapons.

INT. BO'S ROOM - DAY

Jen practices calligraphy.  The governess is by her side
embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen.  The
maid enters.

				MAID
		There is a Miss Shu Lien here to
		see you.

Jen stops and looks up at them.

				GOVERNESS
		Miss is busy right now.

				MAID
		I'll tell her.

				JEN
		Show her in.

The governess shoots her a look.

				GOVERNESS
		This spells trouble.

				JEN
		I have a guest.

The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in.

				MAID
		This way please.

The governess and Yu exchange quick glances.  The governess
bows slightly and departs.

				JEN
		I've missed you.

				YU
		How so?

				JEN
		I'm bored.

Yu sees the calligraphy.

				YU
		You're doing calligraphy?

				JEN
		I'll write your name.  Just for fun.

Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness.

				YU
		I never realized my name looks like
		"sword."

Jen freezes slightly.

				YU
		You write gracefully.  Calligraphy
		is so similar to fencing.

				JEN
		Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

The maid enters with tea.

				JEN
		Please.

				YU
		Thank you for seeing me.  I hear
		your wedding day is near.  You must
		be overwhelmed by the preparations.

				JEN
		I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less
		I think of it the better.  My
		parents are arranging everything.
		The Gous are a very powerful family.
		My marrying one will be good for my
		father's career.

				YU
		You are fornuate to marry into such
		a noble family.

				JEN
		Am I?  I wish I were like the
		heroes in the books I read.  Like
		you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm
		happy to be marrying.  But to be
		free to live my own life, to choose
		whom I love... That is true
		happiness.

				YU
		Do you think so?  Let me tell you a
		story.

				JEN
		About you and Li Mu Bai?

				YU
		Yes.  Did you know I was once
		engaged to be married?

				JEN
		No, really?

				YU
		His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was
		a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
		One day, while in battle, he was
		killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
		enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went
		through a lot together.  Our
		feelings for each other grew
		stronger.  But how could we dishonor
		Meng's memory?  So the freedom you
		talk about, I too desire it.  But I
		have never tasted it.

				JEN
		Too bad for Meng, but it's not your
		fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

				YU
		I am not an aristocrat, as you
		are... but I must still respect a
		woman's duties.

				JEN
		Don't distance us.  From now on,
		let's be like sisters.

				YU
		Then as a sister, let me wish you
		happiness in your marriage.

EXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY

The maid escorts Yu out.  Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
corner.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly
from bed and looks out the window.  A light breeze stirs her
hair.  The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face
dissolves, into...

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.  She sits in
a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
that is traveling through the spectacular desert.  Across
from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.

				MADAM YU
		What a godforsaken place!  Can't
		your father be appointed closer to
		civilization?  Jen... are you
		listening to me?

Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
beautiful mountainside.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
tree, watching Jen.

				TSAI
		Let's go!

They drop down silently and walk away.  From another rooftop,
Lo looks silently on.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tsai and May enter the house.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going
through their belongings.

Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's
mask -- revealing Bo.  Tsai has another long knife at his
throat.

				TSAI
		Who are you?

				BO
		Wait!  I'm a friend!

Tsai pauses.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling
pot of vegetable and meatball soup.  Her father and Bo are
now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight.

				TSAI
		I don't care about your sword.

				BO
		Why were you spying on the Yus?

				TSAI
		I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.
		I'm a police inspector from Shaan
		Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a
		master criminal.  I hear she
		infiltrated the Yus.  She must have
		come with them when they transferred
		here.  But with Yu's reputation, I
		can't just go in and accuse her.

				BO
		This Jade Fox is a woman?

				TSAI
		Yes.

				BO
		Then leave her to me.

				TSAI
		Pardon me, but I doubt you can
		handle her.  My wife was quite a
		martial arts expert.  Jade Fox
		killed her.  So you see, this is
		personal.  Leave her to me.

				MAY
		It's ready!
			(re: the soup)


				BO
		I'm ready for anything!

Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks.  May intercepts
him with her own chopsticks.

				MAY
		Father gets first dip.

Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a
meatball but to catch an incoming dart.  A dart wrapped with
a note.  Bo jumps up.

				TSAI
		They're gone.

				MAY
		What does it say?

				TSAI
		"We'll settle this at midnight on
		Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out
		of her hole.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to
another man, whose back is to her.

				SIR TE
		Shu Lien, look who's here.

The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai.

EXT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.

				LI
		Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
		suspicion on Governor Yu.

				YU
		But something is going on at the Yu
		household.

				LI
		What have you discovered?

From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer.  Li takes it, his
face darkening.

				LI
		Jade Fox?  Impossible.

				YU
		You always suspected she'd fled to
		the West.

				LI
		I didn't think she'd dare come back
		to Peking!

				YU
		Is there any place safer than under
		the nose of Governor Yu?

				LI
		So I shall avenge my master's death
		after all.

				YU
		Be careful.  Sir Te requires
		discretion.  Official business is
		difficult enough.  Don't let
		personal feelings make it worse.
		And I don't know... even this
		poster... could be some sort of trap.

				LI
		Did you see who posted it?

Yu pauses.

				YU
		No.

				LI
		It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
		On the night of the theft there was
		a brawl near Yu's.  Were you
		involved?

				YU
		It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he
		followed the thief to the Yus'.

				LI
		Have you questioned him yet?

				YU
		No, not yet...

				LI
		But your men are watching over Yu's
		compund?

				YU
		No, I'd already sent them home.
		You can blame me for losing the
		sword, but please trust that I'll
		get it back soon using my own
		methods.

				LI
		That's not what I meant.  I don't
		care about the sword.

				YU
		What do you mean?  Didn't you come
		back here for it?

				LI
		I don't know it was stolen until I
		got here.

				YU
		Then, why did you come?

				LI
		Well, we had talked...

De Lu enters.

				DE LU
		Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li,
		your room is ready.

				LI
		Thank you.  Please lead the way.

EXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT

Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.  Bo stifles a
yawn.

				BO
		The fox doesn't care much for
		punctuality.  Still no sign of her.

An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
her face, holding a cane.  The three exchange glances.

				TSAI
		Enough!  Show yourself.

The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.

				FOX
		Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for
		your stubbornness.

				BO
		That's what you think, old witch!

				TSAI
		If you surrender now, you'll suffer
		less.  But if you resist, I won't
		stop until you're dead.

				MAY
		Father!  Let me avenge my mother's
		death.

				FOX
		You'll soon end up like her, you
		little whore!

				BO
		You'll pay for that!

A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
the opportunity presents itself.

				TSAI
			(to Bo)
		She's going to paralyze you!

Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo.  May shoots an arrow at
her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.

				TSAI
		May!

Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.

				FOX
		Tsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!

				MAY
		Father, are you all right?

Li addresses Fox.

				LI
		Wudan should have gotten rid of you
		long ago.  It's been a long time,
		Jade Fox!  You don't remember me...
		But you should remember my master.
		You infiltrated Wudan while I was
		away.  You stole our master!  Now
		it's time for you to pay!

				FOX
		Your master underestimated us women.
		Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
		would never teach me.  He deserved
		to die by a woman's hand!

				LI
		You stole the secrets of Wudan's
		highest martial arts.  But after
		ten years of training, your moves
		are still undisciplined.  And
		today, under a Wudan sword... you
		will die!

Li easily brings Fox to the ground.

Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox.  A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.

				FOX
		Disciple, we'll kill them all!

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				BO
		Another one!

				FOX
		I must get rid of Tsai!

Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
figure.

				LI
		Who are you?  Why is the Green
		Destiny in your possession?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		What's it to you?

				LI
		My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green
		Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be
		your master.  Where did you learn
		that "Xuan Piu" move?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		I'm just playing around.

				LI
		Tell me, who is your master?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				FOX
		We must kill them!

Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
back, hitting him in the head.  Fox and the masked figure
leap away.

May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
Bo kneels beside her.

				MAY
		Father!

EXT. TE'S - DAY

Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them.

				TE
		This is Tsai?

				MAY
		My father.  Police Inspector from
		Shaan.

				TE
		This should be reported to Governor
		Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You
		believe the killer is hiding out in
		his compound.

				YU
		I'd bet my life on it!

				TE
			(to Li and Yu)
		Come with me.

He exits the room.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Te, Li, and Yu are seated.

				SIR TE
		This needs to be resolved, and
		quickly.

				LI
		I'll get into the Yu household and
		get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and
		her gang.

				YU
		We must be careful.  Governor Yu is
		a court official, and in charge of
		security.  Any disturbance will
		cast suspicion on him.  It might
		get Sir Te in trouble.

				SIR TE
		This is a delicate matter.

				YU
		Sir Te, can you find some excuse to
		invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

				SIR TE
		What do you have in mind?

				YU
		The best way to trap a fox is
		through her cubs.

Sir Te and Li look puzzled.

EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY

Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau.

				MADAM YU
		Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
		with these wedding gifts.  She's
		being so considerate.

				YU
		I'm sorry she's not feeling well
		enough to receive you today.

				MADAM YU
		I heard Sir Te lost something.  And
		now Madame Te's not feeling well...

Jen sits silently reading.

				YU
		We know who stole the missing item.
		If the thief returns it, I'm sure
		Sir Te will pursue the matter no
		further.

				MADAM YU
		That's good.  Sometimes the help
		can't keep their hands to themselves.
		It's very embarassing.

				YU
		Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
		people can make mistakes... that
		can bring ruin to themselves and
		their families.

				MADAM YU
		But don't be too lenient.

				YU
		No mercy will be shown toward the
		murderer who turned up in Peking.

				MADAM YU
		A murderer?

				YU
		Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu
		Bai's own master.  Last night, she
		killed a policeman who had tracked
		her down.

				MADAM YU
		A female criminal!  Now that's news!

Jen becomes visibly upset.

				JEN
		You say she killed a policeman?

				YU
		Yes, from the West.  He went
		undercover and and followed her
		here,

				MADAM YU
		Maybe the murderer and the thief
		are one and the same.

				YU
		I doubt it.  This thief... it very
		unusual...

As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
pot slips from her hand.  Without even looking down, Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.

				YU
		...And most likely smarter than a
		mere killer.

Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.

				JEN
			(formal)
		Greetings, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu
		Bai, the renowned swordsman.

				LI
		Delighted to meet you.

Li sizes Jen up.

				TE
		Miss Yu is soon to be married.

				LI
		Congratulations.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.

				MAY
		Why don't you come in?

				BO
		I'm standing guard.

				MAY
		Come in.  It's cold.

She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.

				MAY
		Come in.  We don't have to fear
		Jade Fox if we're together.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A still, dark night.

EXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Something moves in the moonlight.  A hooded figure jumps down.

Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.

				LI
		Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
		You've brought me the sword?

				FIGURE
		I do as I please.

The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.

				LI
		Where's your master?

				FIGURE
		What's it to you?

The figure floats away.  Li chases after her.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
displaying amazing floating skills.

INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure bounces into an old monastery.  Li is already
there.

				LI
		Had enough flying?  You've got
		potential.  You've studied the
		Wudan Manual but you don't
		understand it.  You need a real
		master.

The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her
eyes.

				FIGURE
		Do you think you are a real master?

				LI
		Like most things, I am nothing.
		It's the same for this sword.  All
		of it is simply a state of mind.

				FIGURE
		Stop talking like a monk!  Just
		fight!

				LI
		Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

				FIGURE
		On guard!

				LI
		Real sharpness comes without effort.

EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
her.

The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.

The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly.  Li gets even
more elusive, using a branch to repel her.

				LI
		No growth without assistant.  No
		action without reaction.  No desire
		without restraint.  Now give
		yourself up and find yourself again.
		There is a lesson for you.

Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
slightly.

				FIGURE
		Go ahead.

				LI
		Why should I?  You need practice.
		I can teach you to fight with the
		Green Destiny, but first you must
		learn to hold it in stillness.

				FIGURE
		Why do you want to teach me?

				LI
		I've always wanted a disciple
		worthy of Wudan's secrets.

				FIGURE
		And if I use them to kill you?

				LI
		That's a risk I'm willing to take.
		Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade
		Fox couldn't corrupt you.

The figure's eyes cloud with tears.

				FIGURE
		Wudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your
		lessons!

The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
alone in the monastery.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen slips in through the window.  She pulls off her mask, as
she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing.

				FOX
		You're home late... or should I say
		early?

				JEN
		Why are you still here?  You killed
		a policeman.  You should leave!
		You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

				FOX
		They wouldn't have found me if you
		hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a
		little girl, you thought stealing
		would be fun?  You, too, are
		responsible for that death.  Come
		with me.  You don't want to waste
		your life as the wife of some
		bureaucrat.  Denied your talent...
		As a master and disciple we will
		rule.

				JEN
		I'll never live as a thief!

				FOX
		You're already a thief.

				JEN
		That was just for fun.  How can I
		leave?  Where would I go?

				FOX
		Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of
		anyone in our way.  Even your father.

				JEN
		Shut up!

				FOX
		It's the Giang Hu fighter
		lifestyle... kill or be killed.
		Exciting, isn't it?

				JEN
		I owe you nothing.

				FOX
		Yes, you do!  You are still my
		disciple.

Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few
blows.  Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's
pressure points, disabling her.  Jen pushes her across the
room.

				JEN
		You think you've been teaching me
		all these years from the manual?
		You couldn't even decipher the
		symbols!

				FOX
		I studied the diagrams.  But you
		hid the details!

				JEN
		You wouldn't have understood, even
		if I had tried to explain.  You
		know... you've gone as far as you
		can go.  I hid my skills so as not
		to hurt you.

				FOX
		If I hadn't seen you fight with Li
		Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
		all you've hidden from me.

				JEN
		Master... I started learning from
		you in secret when I was 10.  You
		enchanted me with the world of
		Giang Hu.  But once I realized I
		could surpass you, I became so
		frightened!  Everything fell apart.
		I had no one to guide me, no one to
		learn from.

				FOX
		Believe me, I've a lesson or two
		left to teach you!

Fox exits.

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY

The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.

EXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY

Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
at ease with the weapon.  He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway.

				YU
		The sword is back... are you happy?

Li smiles.

				LI
		I admit, getting it back makes me
		realize how much I'd missed it.

				YU
		But it's not your sword anymore.
		You gave it to Sir Te.

				LI
		True.  But I must borrow it for one
		last mission.  Jade Fox must die at
		its edge.  Did you know what you
		were hiding when you covered for
		that girl?

				YU
		My job was to get the sword back,
		without embarassing anyone.  I
		wasn't about to ruin her life, or
		her father's.

				LI
		You did your job well.  But, this
		girl... I saw her last night.

				YU
		I knew she would intrigue you.

				LI
		She needs direction... and training.

				YU
		She's an aristocrat's daughter.
		She's not one of us.  In any case,
		it will all be over soon.  You'll
		kill Fox, and she'll marry.

				LI
		That's not for her.  She should
		come to Wudan and become a disciple.

				YU
		But Wudan does not accept women.

				LI
		For her, they might make an
		exception.  If not, I'm afraid
		she'll become a poisoned dragon.

				YU
		It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan
		accepts her, her husband might
		object.

				LI
		I thought by giving away the sword,
		I could escape the Giang Hu world.
		But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

				YU
		I wish there were something more I
		could do to help you.

				LI
		Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen is asleep.  A noise awakens her.

Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of
Jen's waiting sword.

Jen's sword drops to the ground.

				JEN
		Lo?

				LO
		Jen!

Lo grabs her by the wrist.

				JEN
		You shouldn't have come.

				LO
		With all the traffic on your
		rooftop these days... it took me a
		while to get in here.  I can't wait
		any longer.  I was wrong to let you
		go.  Come back with me.  You'll be
		happy in the desert.  You'll be
		free there.

Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms
again.

				JEN
		You've been looking for me all this
		time?

FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen
admires the piece, her most prized possession.

Madam Yu sits opposite her.

				MADAM YU
		Jen... stop playing with it.

Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens.

				JEN
		I won't break it.

EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.

				GUARD A
		It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is
		coming!

His warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.

				MADAM YU
		Lower the shade, don't let them see
		you!

				DARK CLOUD (LO)
		Don't touch the women!

Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.

She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
flails beside him.

She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback.

				LO
		Let's go!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.

				LO
		Come get your comb.

She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse.

				LO
		Hurry back to your mother.

Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.

EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY

A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
keeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as
she dismounts.

One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
feet away.

In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face.  He crumples to the sand.

The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
and charge her at once.

In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back.

Lo calls out and stops the fight.

				LO
		She's mine.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
20 feet apart.  Their pace has slowed considerably.  In
fact, they're dead tired.

				LO
		Let's stop a moment.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LO
			(shouting a bit)
		You're tired.  You need rest.  Your
		horse needs water.  There's a creek
		up here.

He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.

				LO
		Well, there used to be!  What's
		your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call
		me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall
		or big, but I'm quick as lightning.

				JEN
		My comb!

She kicks him.  They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
collapses.  She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.

INT. CAVE - DAY

Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur.  She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.
Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her
are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp
arrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows.

				LO
		If you like that arrow, I can make
		you a bow.  Great for hunting wild
		chicken.  They're delicious.

Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but
her legs betray her and she falls.

				LO
		You need to eat, understand?  Then
		you'll have the strength to fight.
		Understand?

He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.
He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts
grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she
starts to wolf it down.

				LO
		You're eating too fast.  Slowly.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.  A chicken
roasts over a fire.  Lo whistles.

Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY

Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
But soon she passes out.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen again awakes inside the cave.  Lo tries to feed her some
water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up.

				LO
		You've got quite a temper.  It's
		better this way.

				JEN
		You coward!

				LO
		Still in a bad mood?  At least
		you're speaking.  What's your name?

Jen spits at Lo.

				LO
		I didn't think the Hans had names
		like that.

Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the
flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.

Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.

He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her.

				LO
		Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would
		already have done it.  You must be
		dying for a bath.  Fresh water's
		hard to get here.  But I managed to
		bring some up.  You can wear my
		clothes when you're done.  They're
		clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so
		you'll know where I am.  After the
		bath, you'll be calmer.

Jen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as
he walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.
While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud
rendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember
all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few
passages.  Jen smiles.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet.

				LO
		No more hitting on the head!  All
		this trouble for a comb?

				JEN
		It's mine.  It means a lot to me.
		A barbarian like you wouldn't
		understand.

				LO
		Not true.  I can use it to pick
		fleas from my horse.

				JEN
		By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

				LO
		I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I
		though you were a Han.

				JEN
		Give me back my comb.

				LO
		I don't take orders from anyone.

				JEN
		Give it back.

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a
little blood from his chest.  Furious, Lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly.  Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay.  Violence turns
into unleashed passion.

EXT. DESERT OASIS - DAY

Lo and Jen ride across the desert.  Jen holds tightly to him.

EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.

				LO
		When I was a boy, one night, I saw
		a thousand shooting stars.  I
		thought, where did they all go?
		I'm an orphan.  I used to look for
		stars alone.  I thought if I rode
		to the other end of the desert, I'd
		find them.  I've been riding in the
		desert ever since.

				JEN
		And so, the little boy became a
		fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find
		the stars, so he stole my comb.

Lo pauses.

				LO
		Out here, you always fight for
		survival.  You have to be part of a
		gang to stand a chance.  Slowly,
		your gang becomes your family.  All
		that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
		scare people and make my life easier.

				JEN
		So you're still that little boy
		looking for shooting stars.

				LO
		I am a man.  And now I've found the
		brightest star of all.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.

				LO
		Your father's men are looking for
		you.

Jen doesn't respond.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY

Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over,
viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.

				LO
		Your father's men are still looking
		for you.  They're still out there,
		circling closer.

				JEN
		Let them look.

				LO
		It is trouble for me.

Jen bites her lip.

				JEN
		Don't send me back!

				LO
		You must decide.  You might get
		tired of this life.  You might
		begin to miss your family.  If it
		were our daughter, we'd look for
		her too.  She would miss us.  Jen...
		I want you to be mine forever.  I
		will make my mark on the world.  I
		will earn your parents' respect.
		We have a legend.  Anyone who dares
		to jump from the mountain, God will
		grant his wish.  Long ago, a young
		man's parents were ill, so he
		jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't
		even hurt.  He floated away, far
		away, never to return.  He knew his
		wish had come true.  If you believe,
		it will happen.  The elders say, "A
		faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

INT. TENT - DAY

Jen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They
embrace.

				JEN
		Keep it safe.  Return it to me when
		we are together again.

				LO
		I will.

				JEN
			(smiling painfully)
		If you don't, I'll come after you.
		And I won't let you off so easy.

EXT. TENT - DAY

Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
light.

End of flashback.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

				LO
		Wherever I went, someone always
		recognized me.  I really tried.
		Later, I heard you came to Peking.
		I was afraid I'd never see you
		again.  So I came.  I can't let you
		marry.

Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from
outside the door.

				JEN
			(whispering)
		Go.

				LO
		Jen...

				JEN
			(through her tears)
		Don't ever come back.

Lo hovers at the window frame.

				LO
		So it's over?

Jen pauses.

				JEN
		Yes.

Lo thrusts a small object in her hand.

He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of
sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall.

				MAID
		We heard noises.

				JEN
		It was just a cat.

The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door.

Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo
has given her.

EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

The noise and color of a wedding procession.  A marching
band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
handsome white horse.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides
silently in the bride's carriage.

EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
gate.

				YU
		You think Jade Fox will show up?

				LI
		She's out there, but I doubt she'll
		show herself.  We'll keep our eyes
		open.  Sooner or later, she'll come
		for the girl.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

A small arrow flies into the carriage.  Jen calmly lifts the
red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the
panelling inside the carriage.

We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen
doesn't seem to notice.

				LO
			(v.o.)
		Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine!

Lo runs wildly into the crowd.

				LO
		Come with me to the desert!  Jen!
		Come with me to Xin Jiang!

The guards surround Lo, but he escapes.

EXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY

Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
pressed against Lo's neck.  Yu comes running around the
corner and sees them.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		Come with me!  Hurry!

INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who
look him over.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		You thought she'd give it all up
		and go back West with you?

				LO
		She's mine.

				LI
		Either way, you are no good to her
		dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans
		hunting you, you'll soon be in
		their hands.

				LO
		I don't care anymore.

				LI
		If you truly loved her, you wouldn't
		say that.

				YU
		Don't you want to see her again.

				LI
		All right.  I'll write you an
		introduction.  Take it to Wudan.
		Wait there for news from me.

				LO
		All right.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
compound, a sense of panic in the air.  Yu gives Li a look.
Li shrugs.

INT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty
sword case, his voice rising.

				SIR TE
		When will this end?  They take it,
		they put it back, they take it
		again.  My home is turning into a
		warehouse.

Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te.

				TE
		Speak!

				BO
		Jen has run away!  Gou found the
		wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu
		requests your assistance.  You know
		the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants
		to find her, and keep her from harm.

				LI
		Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't
		worry.

INT. TEA STALL - DAY

Jen arrives at the tea stall.  She places her sword on the
table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu
martial arts characters sitting nearby.

				WAITRESS
		What can I serve you?

As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm.

				JEN
		The cup is dirty.

The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away.
The men approach Jen.

				GANGSTER A
		Hello.  What is your name?

				JEN
			(without lifting her eyes)
		Long.

				GANGSTER B
		It's young Master Long.  My
		apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
		this is my brother in arms, Flying
		Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to
		Huai An, and where are you headed,
		Master Long?

				JEN
		Anywhere there's action.

The two men exchange glances.

				GANGSTER A
		In that case, perhaps we could be
		of assistance.

				JEN
		Don't bother.

				GANGSTER A
		You don't seem to understand.

				JEN
		So what if I don't?

				GANGSTER B
		We have ways of helping you
		understand.

The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped
into scraps by Jen.

				GANGSTER A
			(stunned)
		Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

				JEN
		He is my defeated foe!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
horses in the background.

				YU
		Have some tea.

As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
Embarrassed, Li pulls back.

				LI
		Shu Lien... The things we touch
		have no permanence.  My master
		would say... there is nothing we
		can hold on to in this world.  Only
		by letting go can we truly possess
		what is real.

				YU
		Not everything is an illusion.  My
		hand... wasn't that real?

				LI
		Your hand, rough and callused from
		machete practice... All this time,
		I've never had the courage to touch
		it.

Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.

				LI
		Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
		dragons, full of corruption... I
		tried sincerely to give it up but I
		have brought us only trouble.

				YU
		To repress one's feelings only
		makes them stronger.

				LI
		You're right, but I don't know what
		to do.  I want to be with you...
		just like this.  It gives me a
		sense of peace.

Li Mu Bai smiles.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Jen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her.

				WAITER
		Please follow me.

				JEN
		I want a clean room.

				WAITER
		We have plenty.  Your order?

Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down.

				JEN
		Steamed whole cod, bite-size
		meatballs, a little starchy, but
		keep the sauce light, shark fin
		soup, mixed vegetables, and some
		warm wine.

				WAITER
			(dazed)
		I have to order from a bigger
		restaurant.

				JEN
		Hurry then.

The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to
place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not
much money left.

A large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey
the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs.

				GIANG HU A
		That's him.

				MI BIAO
		I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true
		master has arrived.  I have come to
		seek a lesson.

Jen ignores him.

				MI BIAO
			(bristles)
		You asked for it!

Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea.
Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at
a sensitive pressure point.  This provokes a reaction from
the other men.

				JEN
		What kind of Iron Arm are you?

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		You have amazing technique!  I am
		Flying Machete.  Are you related to
		Southern Crane?

				JEN
		Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything
		with two feet.  Who could remember
		such long-winded names?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
		you don't know his master, Southern
		Crane?

				JEN
		Who are you?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

				JEN
			(furious)
		Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes
		me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.
		You'll be the first to feel my
		sword today.

Jen leaps up and dives into battle.  The men all use
different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the
powerful Green Destiny.

				MONK JING
		Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?

				JEN
		A monk, in a place like this?  You
		need a lesson!

				MONK JING
		Who are you?

She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing
the Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Who am I?  I am... I am the
		Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed
		with the Incredible... Green
		Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern
		Crane... lower your head... and ask
		for mercy.  I am the desert dragon.
		I leave no trace.  Today I fly over
		Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over
		Wudan Mountain!

Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who
battled with Jen.

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		We politely asked for a friendly
		match, but she showed no respect,
		and attacked us.  Everyone came by
		to teach her a lesson.

				MI BIAO
		Her sword was just too powerful.

				MONK JING
		I've traveled everywhere, but never
		met anyone so uncivilized.

				SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD
			(heavily bandaged)
		She kept accusing me of being Gou
		Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this
		Gou, anyway?

				YU
		Her husband.

The men all nod their heads.

EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY

Li and Yu ride together.

				LI
			(to Yu)
		We're close to your headquarters.
		Go home and check in.

				YU
		What about you?

				LI
		I'll look around and catch up later.

				YU
		Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get
		a good night's sleep at headquarters.

Yu takes a fork off the road.  Thunder can be heard in the
darkening sky.

EXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY

A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
yard of Sun Security.  They stop when Yu enters.

				SECURITY MAN A
		Mistress, you're back.

				YU
		It's you!  How's everything here?

				CAPTAIN
		Fine.  You've been gone a while.

				YU
		Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
		Your wife was due?

				AH WAI
		Yeah, a baby girl.

				YU
		Good!

				AH WAI
		I'll be happy if she's half as
		strong as you.

				YU
		Mrs. Wu...

				AUNT WU
		You're back!

				YU
		How's the arm?  Still sore?

				AUNT WU
		Much better.  You've been gone so
		long.

				YU
		Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
		night.

				AUNT WU
			(excited)
		I'll go and make up his room!

Aunt Wu hustles out.  Yu goes into her own room.

INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP

Yu lights incense for her former fiancé Meng.  Hearing
something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing
outside downstairs.

				JEN
		Sister Shu Lien...

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some
clothes.  Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets
herself on the edge of Yu's bed.  Yu brings over the clothes.

				YU
		Here you must be in proper attire.

				JEN
		I'm just borrowing some clean
		clothes.  I'm not staying.

				YU
		I'll give them to you.

				JEN
		I was just passing by and wondered
		how you were.

Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on
Yu's shoulder in tears.

				JEN
		You, sister...

				YU
		Look at the trouble you've caused.
		Now you know what Giang Hu life is
		really like.  If you think of me as
		your sister, let me give you some
		sisterly advice.  You can run from
		marriage, but not your parents.

				JEN
		They forced me to marry!

				YU
		Go back to them first.  Then you
		can decide about Lo.

				JEN
		You know about Lo?

				YU
		He really loves you.  Come back to
		Peking with me.  We'll find a
		solution.

				JEN
		Where is he now?

				YU
		Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
		He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

				JEN
		You're working together to set me
		up!  I'm leaving!

				YU
		How dare you accuse us?  I always
		knew you had stolen the sword!
		I've done nothing but protect you
		and your family.  And you're repaid
		me with nothing but contempt.  Li
		Mu Bai himself spared you, and all
		you do is insult him.  We wanted
		some peace and you've ruined it all!
		You're no sister of mine!

				JEN
		What do I care?  You were never a
		real friend anyway.  But I wonder,
		how long could you last as my enemy?

Jen gets up to leave.  Yu intercepts her.

				YU
		Put the sword down!

Jen jumps out.

INT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY

Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
still practicing.

They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder.

				YU
			(calling out)
		Jen!

Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny.

				YU
		Everyone out.  Shut the doors.

The men leave.

				YU
		Fine... the friendship is over.

Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
begins her battle with Jen.

Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none
are any match for the Green Destiny.

After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks
admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands.

				YU
		Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's
		sword.

				JEN
		Come and get it if you can.

				YU
		Without the Green Destiny, you are
		nothing.

				JEN
		Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.
		Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go
		ahead.

Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.  Just as the
Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade
at Jen's neck.  She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls
back.

				YU
		Give me the sword.

Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm.

				JEN
		Take it!

Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in.

				LI
			(enraged)
		Stop it!  You don't deserve the
		Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Not another lecture!  On guard!

				LI
		Let's end this here.

				JEN
		Only the sword will settle this.

Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.

EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY

Jen runs into a sea of bamboo.  She appears to have lost Li
but is not slowing down.  Her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud.  The wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by Li.

The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges.  They glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat.  Finally Jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as Li.  The two hold their positions for a
while, as the bamboo bends.

				LI
		I only let you go because I wanted
		to see the real you.

Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.

				JEN
		What do you know about a true heart?

Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.  The bamboo
straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground.  Jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.

Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
forest.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids.  Jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with Li.  Jen loses her balance.

				JEN
		What do you want?

				LI
		What I've always wanted, to teach
		you.

				JEN
		All right.  If you can take back
		the sword in three moves, I'll go
		with you.

Li takes the sword back.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LI
		Kneel!

				JEN
		Never!

				LI
		Then you have no use for the sword.

Li throws the sword into the rapids.

Jen dives in to retrieve it.  He follows Jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
rapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious
Jen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

It's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine
paste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the
needle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense
and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.

				FOX
		Sooner or later, they'd drag you
		back to Peking.  Your parents will
		never accept you again.  But why go
		home?  We've gone this far, we
		won't stop now.  You'll always be
		my lady.  At last, we'll be our own
		masters.  We'll be happy.  That's
		the most important thing.  All we
		have left is each other, right?
		Lie down and rest.

Jen is too weak to respond.

Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Fox scurries ahead in the rain.  Her eyes catch something,
but she keeps moving.

INT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu.

				AUNT WU
		She's crazy.  You should have
		killed her.

				YU
		I didn't have the heart.

				AUNT WU
		Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

Yu senses movement at the window.  Looking out, she sees
Jade Fox in the distance.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a
cup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up,
and walks into the rain.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
raindrops.  Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
standing there.  Jen limps towards him while mumbling.

				JEN
		Is it me or the sword you want?

Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.

				LI
		You've been drugged!

Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Jen gestures that she doesn't know.  Yu and Bo enter.  Yu
looks at Jen.

				YU
		What happened?

				LI
		Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you
		get here?

				YU
		We followed Jade Fox.

Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's
direction.  Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all,
sending them flinging hither and thither.

Fox shows herself.  Li attacks her.  She falls back, bleeding
to death.

				LI
		And so you die.

Li touches his neck.

				FOX
		And so shall you!

Li pulls a single needle from his neck.

				YU
		A poisoned needle!

				FOX
		You deserve to die, but the life I
		was hoping to take... was Jen's.
		Ten years I devoted to you.  But
		you deceived me!  You hid the
		manual's true meaning.  I never
		improved... but your progress was
		limitless!  You know what poison is?
		An eight-year-old girl, full of
		deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My
		only family... my only enemy...

Jade Fox dies.

				YU
		You can't die!  Tell us what poison
		you used!  You can't die!  Tell us
		the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu
		Bai die!

				JEN
		She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
		poison.  It goes straight to the
		heart.

				LI
		My blood will soon reverse its flow.
		It's the same poison she used to
		kill my master.  There is no
		antidote.

				YU
		That can't be!  Everything has an
		antithesis!  Why not this?

				JEN
		The antidote exists.  She taught it
		to me.  The formula is simple, but
		it takes time to prepare.  Trust me.
		As you have helped me, let me help
		you.

				LI
		All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on
		as long as I can.

				YU
			(takes the comb from
			her hair)
		Take my horse and go to the compound.
		Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help
		you.  Hurry!

				JEN
		Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Bo is burying Fox in the rain.

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - NIGHT

The guards surround Jen.  She pushes past them.

				JEN
		Where is Mrs. Wu?

Aunt Wu comes running out.

				AUNT WU
		Stop it!

Jen pulls out Yu's comb.

				JEN
		Shu Lien told me to show you this.

				AUNT WU
		Let her in.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational,
eerily calm.

				YU
		Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some
		hope...

				LI
		Shu Lien...

				YU
		Save your strength.

				LI
		My life is departing.  I've only
		one breath left.

				YU
		Use it to meditate.  Free yourself
		from this world as you have been
		taught.  Let your soul rise to
		eternity with your last breath.  Do
		not waste it... for me.

				LI
		I've already wasted my whole life.
		I want to tell you with my last
		breath... I have always loved you.
		I would rather be a ghost, drifting
		by your side... as a condemned
		soul... than enter heaven without
		you.  Because of your love... I
		will never be a lonely spirit.

Yu cries.

She kisses him lightly.  He closes his eyes.

EXT. PATH - DAY

As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine
in her hands.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li is in Yu's arms.  They're holding hands.  The sun shines
in.  Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead.

Jen is at the door.

				JEN
		He's gone?

Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder.

Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny.  Jen kneels.  Yu raises
the sword, but doesn't kill her.

				YU
		Bo... please take this sword back
		to Sir Te.

He takes the sword from her.

				YU
			(to Jen)
		Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.
		Lo awaits you there.  Promise me
		one thing, whatever path you take
		in this life... be true to yourself.

EXT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple
gate, and sees Lo standing there.

He runs to her.  She greets him.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - MAGIC

Jen and Lo make love.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him,
Jen gone.

EXT. WU TAN MOUNTAIN - DAY

Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge.  The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds.  She looks back at him.

				JEN
		Do you remember the legend of the
		young man?

				LO
		"A faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

				JEN
		Make a wish, Lo.

Lo pauses.

				LO
			(closing his eyes)
		To be back in the desert, together
		again.

Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds.  They seem to
catch her gently, before she disappears into them.

Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down
his cheeks.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way
		to the bottom.

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB

		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!

		Stay right there!

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

	She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
	into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

				WOMAN
		He touched me and it stopped.  The

		I saw a ghost...

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

		Oh no... don't go, darlin', you

	HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
	units screech up to assist.

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
			(checks his notebook)

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the
		gun. You just tell me where you want
		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

				ERIC
			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the
	pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.
	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

	who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
				ALBRECHT

	He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

				ERIC
		Top Dollar, you're the only one

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
	hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
		hours.  All at once...

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
	eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

				ERIC
		I didn't think you could handle it
		either.

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

				LEAD SWAT
		That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
	him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
	Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

	ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

	Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

	STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

	Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
	shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

				TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
		On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
		firing!

	A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

	RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

	A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

	ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

	Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

	Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
	skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

	ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

	Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

				LEAD SWAT
		Holy shit, it's spiderman.

	He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

				LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
	Eric, trying to keep up.

	ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

	PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
		He's off the roof.  We can't see
		him.

	CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

	pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

				LEAD SWAT
		Dammit to hell!
			(beat; to men)
		Come on.

	ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

	Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
	okay, up and running.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

	as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
	stop, blocking the exit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

				ALBRECHT
			(from car)
		Come on!

	CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

	We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.
			(beat)
		You sure I can't just take you to 
		the emergency ward?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		They couldn't do anything for me.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		How 'bout the morgue?

				ERIC (O.S.)
		No.  I have one more thing to do.

	EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

	Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

	ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

				ALBRECHT
		You're gonna kill somebody else.
			(beat; no response)
		We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
		of Band-Aids?

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an 
		anniversary.  This coming night.

	HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

	High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

	INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,
	demons out for Halloween.

	ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

	walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A
	fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

	ANGLE - ELLY ON BROWNSTONE STEPS

	Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

				ELLY
		You're gonna like it here.

	A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.

	ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

	as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

				GRANGE
			(to his MEN)
		If she opens her face again, shoot
		her in the head.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a 
	gigantic gun, draws and cocks.

				ELLY

		Mom -- !

	ANGLE - GUARD #4 AND ELLY

	as he scoops her up, captive.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

	He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

				GRANGE
		You should listen to your mother.
		She said no cats.

	Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

				ELLY
		Gabriel!

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

				GRANGE
		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
	snap his shot.

				GRANGE (CONT'D)
		Say cheese.

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

	as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

	INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

	As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

	INT. LOFT - DUSK

	He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
	of the floor.  He opens it.

	INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

	with a note.

	UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

	The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

	NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

	Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

	ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

	Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

	ANGLE - THE VANITY

	as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
	makeup and smears it on.

							SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

				GRANGE
		He's just out front talking to
		himself.  You tell me. 

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	As before, but the crow is not as fast.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still
		bleed.  How they need air.

	Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Break its neck.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
	the bird.

	Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
	dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
	the hole.

	EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
	himself.

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,
		Mister Draven!  The girl will die
		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

	September 14, 1992

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

	BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
	perched crow large in the f.g.

	TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

	As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

				DIMITRI (O.S.)
		We're losing the light; let's pack
		it in.

	ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

	TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
	style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward 
	the sky.

				ALEXI
		Snow, maybe?

				DIMITRI
		What, you gonna ski on this?

	He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

				DIMITRI (CONT'D)
		Come on, let's bag this.  It's
		beer time.

	Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

	LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

	As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
	wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
	sequence.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
	the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
	as it begins to sprinkle rain.

	ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

	A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
	offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
	totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
	Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
	day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
	unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
	stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

				ELLY
		Guess the picnic got rained out.

	She looks down o.s. at --

	ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

	as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

	RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way
		to the bottom.

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,
		man.

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB
			(pissed off)
		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red
		light!

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!
			(to Elly)
		Stay right there!

	HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

				MICKEY

		You want I should save this for

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

	She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
	into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a
		police officer...

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

				WOMAN
		He touched me and it stopped.  The
		pain.

				ALBRECHT
		What did you say?

				WOMAN
		I saw a ghost...

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

				ALBRECHT
		Oh no... don't go, darlin', you
		stay with me, now... shit!

	HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
	units screech up to assist.

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
			(checks his notebook)

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the
		gun. You just tell me where you want
		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the

	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

	who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
				ALBRECHT
		Jesus Christ...

	He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

				ERIC
		Top Dollar, you're the only one
		here still wasting good air...

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp.
	Eric winces, hard, and --

	FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you
		need to see more.

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
	hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

							FLASH ENDS.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
		hours.  All at once...

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
	eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

				ERIC
		I didn't think you could handle it
		either.

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

				LEAD SWAT
		That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You
		stand down now, and that's an
		order!

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
	him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
	Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

	ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

	Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

	STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

	Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
	shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

				TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
		On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
		firing!

	A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

	RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

	A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

	ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

	Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

	Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
	skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

	ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

	Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

				LEAD SWAT
		Holy shit, it's spiderman.

	He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

				LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
	Eric, trying to keep up.

	ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

	PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
		He's off the roof.  We can't see
		him.

	CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

	pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

				LEAD SWAT
		Dammit to hell!
			(beat; to men)
		Come on.

	ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

	Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
	okay, up and running.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

	as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
	stop, blocking the exit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

				ALBRECHT
			(from car)
		Come on!

	CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

	We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.
			(beat)
		You sure I can't just take you to 
		the emergency ward?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		They couldn't do anything for me.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		How 'bout the morgue?

				ERIC (O.S.)
		No.  I have one more thing to do.

	EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

	Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

	ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

				ALBRECHT
		You're gonna kill somebody else.
			(beat; no response)
		We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
		of Band-Aids?

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an 
		anniversary.  This coming night.

	HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

	High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

	INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,
	demons out for Halloween.

	ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

	walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A
	fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

	ANGLE - ELLY ON BROWNSTONE STEPS

	Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

				ELLY
		You're gonna like it here.

	A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.

	ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

	as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

				GRANGE
			(to his MEN)
		If she opens her face again, shoot
		her in the head.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a 
	gigantic gun, draws and cocks.

				ELLY

		Mom -- !

	ANGLE - GUARD #4 AND ELLY

	as he scoops her up, captive.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

	He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

				GRANGE
		You should listen to your mother.
		She said no cats.

	Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

				ELLY
		Gabriel!

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

				GRANGE
		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
	snap his shot.

				GRANGE (CONT'D)
		Say cheese.

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

	as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

	INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

	As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

	INT. LOFT - DUSK

	He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
	of the floor.  He opens it.

	INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

	with a note.

	UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

	The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

	NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

	Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

	ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

	Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

	ANGLE - THE VANITY

	as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
	makeup and smears it on.

							SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

				GRANGE
		He's just out front talking to
		himself.  You tell me. 

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	As before, but the crow is not as fast.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still
		bleed.  How they need air.

	Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Break its neck.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
	the bird.

	Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
	dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
	the hole.

	EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
	himself.

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,

		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

							SLOW FADE TO DEAD BLACK.

          FADE IN:
          
          EXT. LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT
          
          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward
          the camera in slow motion.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened
          by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven...
          
           
          
          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK.
          A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony
          mask war paint.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day...
          
           
          
          The figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again
          into the mists of time.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          ... they will be reunited with the ones they love.

          EXT. DOCS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Present day. The Crow settles on a shipping container, tilts
          its head, watching...
          
          SUPER TITLE:
          
          "CITY OF ANGELS - OCTOBER 29TH - LA NOCHE DE SAN LUCAS"
          
          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope
          filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of
          the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with
          a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign.
          
          A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder.
          The man discards the glassine envelope...
          
          FOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE
          
          as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up. Let the
          rush begin.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of
          a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these
          docks become a hellish dumping ground. Case in point:
          
          A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON
          
          are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their
          arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN
          (8) is quietly sobbing. ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm the frightened
          boy.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          It's okay, Danny. It's okay...
          
           
          
          NEMO (O.S.)
          
          Lights...
          
           
          
          A bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid
          the glare.
          
           
          
          NEMO (O.S.)
          
          ...camera...
          
           
          
          CLOSE ON
          
          A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted
          face into view via the lens' reflection.
          
           
          
          NEMO (O.S.)
          
          ...action.
          
           
          
          CAMERA FINDS Ashe and Danny's executioners, CURVE, KALI, SPIDER
          MONKEY, and NEMO.
          
          NEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with
          a camcorder. He Pats Ashe's face.
          
           
          
          NEMO
          
          Make-up.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding
          a marigold in his hand.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          Flowers for the dead, Senor?
          
           
          
          CAMERA POV (CLOSE ON ASHE'S EYE)
          
          Ashe stares directly into the camera.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          No? Suite yourself, then.
          
           
          
          Spider Monkey tucks the flower behind his ear. Danny is praying
          now, MUMBLING a Catholic School litany.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          You're wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody up there's listening.
          
           
          
          WHOOSH!
          
          We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient POV,
          perhaps.
          
          CURVE
          
          leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly,
          shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom
          paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the
          "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's also the one who just
          dusted himself
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          (hyped on drugs)
          
          Let's get this over with. Judah's waiting.
          
           
          
          Kali, a cold-eyed heavy-metal femme with a killer's casual stoicism,
          is methodically loading bullets into her revolver. She's taking
          her own sweet time, in defiance of Curve. There's a tension between
          them. Finally, she flicks her wrist, snaps the revolver shut.
          Kali walks up to them...
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I'm scared, Dad.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I know...
          
           
          
          Ashe turns to his executioners, pleading with them...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Listen to me, please. He's just a kid. Let him go. He can't hurt
          you. He doesn't even know who you are...
          
           
          
          ...and puts a bullet through Danny's chest. Ashe SCREAMS.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          NO!!!
          
           
          
          Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him.
          Ashe stares into his son's lifeless eyes.
          
          Curve saunters over, stares down at Ashe, flicks his cigarette
          butt off into the water.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Nothing personal, sport. Guess you were just in the wrong place
          at the wrong time.
          
           
          
          BANG! BANG! BANG! Curve FIRES a gun into Ashe's back. As Ashe
          crumples...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Dump 'em. Let's get this cluster-fuck on the road.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          motions to Kali and Spider Monkey. Together, the three of them
          heave Ashe and Danny into the ocean.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Bon voyage, shitheads.
          
           
          
          EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe and Danny sink down into the murky underworld, taking their
          place amongst a thousand other deep-sixed dreams.
          
          ASHE'S POV
          
          falling further and further away from the light of the surface
          world. Bit by bit, Ashe's struggles subside. All we hear now
          is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT. Darkness begins to close in around
          us, womblike, peaceful...
          
          ...AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS,
          
          something takes shape - a CROW. Winging its way from Ashe's dream-like
          death up through watery depths into a smog-bound cityscape...
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY OF ANGELS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow flies over a bridge with spans the Styx - the city's
          polluted, man-made river.
          
          THE CROW
          
          rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods,
          and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present
          ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass
          welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK".
          Nevertheless, we continue on.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          They say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight
          years ago I lost two of my best friends. Two thousand miles later
          I find I'm still living in the past...
          
           
          
          THE CROW
          
          sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and
          grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent
          HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like insect
          husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters...
          
          WE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP
          
          The Crow circles downward...
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Every night when I close my eyes the dreams come. That's how
          the dead talk to us, I guess. In the dark, when our souls are
          off wandering...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow lands next to an open window. It perches on the edge,
          looking into the loft.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          I just wish I understood what they were telling me.
          
           
          
          CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC)
          
          SARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed. She stirs, troubled by
          uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT, SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT
          
           
          
          As Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's
          not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird. GABRIEL, the cat
          Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of
          the bed.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Hey, Gabriel...
          
           
          
          Sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then
          climbs from bed, making her way across the loft.
          
          SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT
          
          is furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy
          warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside -
          an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle
          window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the
          streets below.
          
          ON SARAH'S CANVASSES
          
          Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters.
          Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no
          real surprise.
          
          CAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a woman
          resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced
          lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead.
          
          SARAH
          
          reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper
          arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black
          angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring
          in her navel, another in a nipple...
          
          In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured
          quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts here
          eyes, turns her face up into the spray. For a brief second we
          see a flash of...
          
           
          
          EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe's death. Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness.
          Just as suddenly we are back in...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah's eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall,
          takes a moment to collect herself.
          
          Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes.
          Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh,
          the symbol of eternity.
          
          As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony
          mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is
          a...
          
          TARNISHED WEDDING RING
          
          Once Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - "FOREVER".
          
          Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask.
          Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts.
          
          Gabriel creeps up, MEOWING forlornly.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (WISTFULLY)
          
          Me too.
          
           
          
          She threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next
          to the ankh, then slips the silver chain over her head. Sarah
          stands, pulls on a jacket, heads out.
          
           
          
          EXT. SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK
          
           
          
          An ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens
          of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like
          confetti. One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she
          peels it off, she catches sight of...
          
           
          
          A PALE FACE
          
          in a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung out
          on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself,
          shivering from withdrawal.
          
          Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets
          at the girl's feet. The girl shies away, frightened, suspicious.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (DRYLY)
          
          Nice place you've got here.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          (a muttered whisper)
          
          No place else to go.
          
           
          
          Sarah can't help but recognize a part of herself in this lost
          soul.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Gotta name?
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Grace. So what?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Listen, Grace, how does some hot coffee sound? Maybe a little
          food?
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          What do you want?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Nothing. Guess you just remind me of someone I used to know.
          
           
          
          After a moment, Grace offers a reluctant nod. Sarah helps her
          from the entryway, into the warmth of the dying light. Grace
          blinks, shields her eyes.
          
          As they walk away down the street, camera rises up to include...
          
          THE CROW
          
          perched on a nearby rooftop, watching them.
          
          CUT TO:
          
          EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT
          
           
          
          the Gargoyle is an usassuming ink shop - the sole oasis of light
          in an otherwise desolated block populated by derelict warehouse
          buildings. Flickering neon BUZZES in the window.
          
          Nearby is a battered road sign - "END CITY LIMITS". Someone has
          spray-painted "OF THE FUCKING WORLD" over "city limits". In the
          distance, the bridge of the River Styx rises through the mist
          like a skeletal dinosaur.

          INT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT
          
           
          
          CLOSE ON a sparking tattoo "gun", the needle WHIRRING as it travels
          over a patch of Vaseline-smeared skin.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Almost finished. Doing okay?
          
           
          
          CUSTOMER (V.O.)
          
          Yeah, stings a little.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          That's why they call me the Mistress of Pain.
          
           
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sarah expertly guiding the needle, wearing
          glasses, surgical gloves, concentrating.
          
          Sarah's buzz-headed CUSTOMER sits in a ratty dentist's chair.
          Sarah is finishing coloring a Japanese dragon which winds its
          way over the man's forearm. She makes another line of color then
          sits back, smoothing more Vaseline over the man's arm. She picks
          up a jeweler's loupe, makes an adjustment on her needle...
          
          Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls covered
          with sheets of flash (ready-made art), bookshelves crammed with
          reference works. Sarah's partner, NOAH, a chain-smoking proto-punk
          Brit, consults with a YOUNG GRUNGE COUPLE.
          
          LATER -
          
          Noah is closing up shop, while Sarah sterilizes some needles
          in an autoclave.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          What a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo "If you're reading
          this, you're too close" on his bleedin' bum!
          
           
          
          Sarah smiles. Noah fires up a fag, flops down into a dentist
          chair. The two slip into a familiar, good-natured banter.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Christ, I'm knackered.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Beats pushing ink in Detroit.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          That it does, Princess, that it does.
          
          (REMEMBERING)
          
          Oh, I bought you a little present...
          
           
          
          Noah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out. It's
          a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued
          to the bottom - a fortune.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          They do 'em for the Day of the Dead.
          
          (tossing the skull to Sarah)
          
          Nice, huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (reading fortune)
          
          "Life is just a dream on the way to death." I like that.
          
           
          
          Sarah studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding.
          Noah rises, stretching.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Want to grab a beer, then?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          No, I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          So, what's the dirty dog's name?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I've just been having some weird dreams.
          
          (REFLECTING)
          
          You ever dream that you're dying someone else's death?
          
           
          
          Outside we hear a MOTORCYCLE pulling up, then someone KNOCKS
          on the front door.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          (calling out)
          
          Sorry, we're closed.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Open the fucking door!
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          stands, moves to the door.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Look, I said we're...
          
           
          
          BANG! Curve kicks open the door and storms in. He PUNCHES Noah
          in the nose, then heads straight for Sarah.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          You think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          What are you talking about?!
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          I'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off
          the bandages. Look...!!!
          
           
          
          Curve rips open his shirt, revealing his chest.
          
          CURVE'S TATTOO
          
          It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black. Or is it? Upon
          closer examination the crow looks like something else - two demons
          fighting. The design is a classic ambiguous figure - like the
          picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can also be seen
          as a skull.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          A crow...
          
          Damn right, it's a crow. And did I ask for a fucking bird on
          my chest? Did I?!
          
           
          
          Sarah shakes her head.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Then what-the-fuck is it doing there?!
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I don't know, I was just going from the design you gave me...
          
           
          
          SMACK! Curve backhands Sarah across the face. Noah rushes forward,
          blood still running from his nose.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Stop it!
          
           
          
          Curve pulls an automatic from his waist-band and points the gun
          at Noah. Noah freezes...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          What's it going to be, hero? Ready to kiss your faggot-ass good-bye?
          I think so. I think you're shitting yourself you're so goddamn
          ready.
          
           
          
          Curve snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug, snorts up the
          contents. He presses the gun against Noah's forehead.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          Over here, ass-hole...
          
           
          
          As Curve turns, Sarah squeezes a bottle of tattoo ink into the
          killer's eyes, blinding him.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Agh!!! SHIT!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah plants one of her Doc Marten boots in Curve's groin. He
          SCREAMS, doubles over. Sarah pulls the automatic from his grasp
          and trains it on him.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get up.
          
           
          
          Curve cups his balls, slowly rises. His eyes are glowing with
          manic intensity. A slow smile creeps across Curve's face. He
          backs away towards the front door.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Shoulda killed me while you had the chance, sugarplum. Be seeing
          you.
          
           
          
          Curve smashes his fist into the neon sign, then ducks out thedoor.
          Moments later we hear his motorcycle ROAR to life. He takes off,
          ENGINE SCREAMING away into the night.
          
          Sarah lowers the gun, takes a deep breath, looks to Noah.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You okay?
          
           
          
          Noah wipes his bloody nose, looks to the floor where Curve discarded
          the drug sachet, shakes his head in disgust.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Fuck me, wonder what they'll be snorting next?
          
           
          
          Sarah shakes her head, at wits end.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I just can't do this anymore... I'm so tired of this.
          
           
          
          Noah pulls Sarah toward him, gives her a big hug.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Easy there, luv. It'll all work out.
          
           
          
          EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah, still clutching Curve's gun, hurries to her Galaxy 500
          which is parked along the nearby train tracks.

          Sarah moves behind the wheel, dumps the gun on the seat, and
          rests her head in her hands. As Sarah raises her head...
          
          SARAH'S POV (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)
          
          The Crow is perched on the hood of her car. Sarah HONKS her horn
          in frustration. The Crow doesn't move.
          
           
          
          EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes out of her car, screaming at the bird.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get out of here! Go!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah FIRES a wild shot into the sky. The Crow files off into
          the night. Sarah collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and
          starts to cry.

          The Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights
          of Downtown. In the distance, a flashing "JESUS SAVES" sign draws
          our attention to a monolithic tower.
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned
          by a weather-worn campanile. The campanile is a complex arabesque
          of rusted iron scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured
          up from an art nouveau fever-dream.
          
          Just as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks away.
          We, however, continue to rush onward, right through one of the

          SCRITCH! SCRITCH! All we see is black, then some vague, shiny
          reflections...
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within
          a box, leashed to a nail with a piece of thread. We were tight
          on its shiny carapace. The beetle strains at its leash, moving
          in a perpetual circle around the nail.
          
          CAMERA MOVES UP
          
          over the side of the box. Although mere inches in height, this
          enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as far as our little
          member of the Coleoptera is concerned.
          
          AS THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK
          
          we see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral glory...
          
          Dark, filled with shadows. The decor is a cross between ruinous
          palatial splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation. The
          upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb network
          of steel girders.
          
          Look close enough and you might see PEOPLE bound to the supporting
          pillars, like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot
          of your bed in the middle of the night.
          
          VOICES draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail
          curtains. CAMERA MOVES IN towards a break in the curtains. We
          linger there for a tantalizing moment...
          
           
          
          JUDAH (V.O.)
          
          Talk to me, Sibyl. Tell me what you see.
          
           
          
          SIBYL (V.O.)
          
          I see Death returning from the veil of tears. He has your name
          on his tongue.
          
           
          
          Now we plunge in through the curtains...
          
          The "camera" consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which
          project images from the outside world onto a circular table,
          offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape.
          TWO FIGURES stand with their backs to us, studying the camera's
          view. The first is...
          
          JUDAH EARL,
          
          A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice.
          Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own
          death. The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one.
          
          SIBYL, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side. Attractive, though
          of indeterminate sex. His/her dour features are hidden beneath
          a black cowl.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          (FATALISTIC)
          
          It's finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear,
          can you tell me that?
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          I see the face of one of your victims.
          
           
          
          Judah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for
          the first time. A kind of madness dances within them.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          All my sins remembered.

          Ashe panics, jerks back. The razor-wire barbs cut into his flesh.
          The more he struggles, the tighter the coils become, slashing
          his hands and face, shredding his clothes. He's caught in his
          son's embrace, the two of them thrashing about in a grotesque
          underwater ballet.

          Strips of the wire still cling to his arms and chest, the barbs
          buried deep in his flesh.
          
          Reliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear. Ashe's

          ASHE
          
          How did I survive?
          
           
          
          Sarah suddenly comes to the terrible realization that Ashe does
          not know he has died.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (coming towards him)
          
          You didn't.
          
           
          
          Ashe looks up at Sarah, uncomprehending.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You're dead.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          No...
          
           
          
          Ashe stands, enraged. He starts toward Sarah. She backs away...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Stop looking at me that way -- stop looking -- this isn't real,
          none of this is real! I'm dreaming this.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (shaking her head, frightened)
          
          No.
          
           
          
          The two of the struggle a moment, Ashe pushes Sarah back. Sarah
          reaches for him, trying to restrain him, trying to somehow keep
          his rising terror in check... she's not getting through to him,
          he can't be made to listen...
          
          Finally, Sarah grabs a kitchen knife from the counter and plunges
          it into Ashe's chest.
          
          Ashe gasps. He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle
          stickout out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back out.
          No pain. No wound. A moment of shock, then...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (looking at her, a tortured whisper)
          
          I'm dreaming this.
          
           
          
          Sarah tries to reach for Ashe again. He tears away from her,
          flinging her back and running for the door.

          blindly up the street.

          CAMERA ISOLATES a tempera painting on the floor that's been executed
          on construction paper. A brush and a collection of paint canisters
          are scattered around it, like the kind you might find in a primary
          school art class. Ashe kneels next to the painting...

          Ashe is working beneath a car. Danny is sprawled on the floor.
          He holds up the painting in question.
          
           
          
          DANNY

          face is splattered with blood. He turns and sees them...

          Ashe is tearing the place apart, sobbing, knocking over racks
          of tools. Finally, he sinks to his knees, his face a mask of
          tears.
          
          Ashe spins, murderous rage in his eyes. Never startle an animal,
          right?
          
          SARAH
          
          stands in the doorway.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Why are you here?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I don't know.
          
           
          
          She stops herself -- she does know, she just didn't want to admit
          it to herself.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I want to help you. I need to.
          
           
          
          Sarah approaches, dropping by Ashe's side. She sees Danny's painting
          which Ashe cradles protectively.
          
          Ashe looks up at Sarah, his eyes full of questions.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Everything's so confused...

          He's not here anymore.
          
           
          
          Sarah draws closer, touched by Ashe's inner struggle. She reaches
          out to him, drawing him into her arms. He stares up at her, eyes
          distant.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          There's no moon...
          
           
          
          Sarah touches Ashe's face, calming him, trying to reach through
          his pain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You've been given another chance, Ashe -- to put the wrong things
          right...
          
           
          
          Sarah's eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered
          nearby. She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the
          lid, dipping her fingers inside...
          
          Sarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic
          feel to it. Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual
          attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable.
          
          As Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face
          using Danny's art supplies.
          
          We see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here,
          fingers dipping into the canister of white there, ruby lips being
          smeared with black...
          
          ...the face that is taking shape is both similar to and different
          from Eric's. It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled through
          Ashe's own, unique pain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I believe there've always been people like you...
          
           
          
          Sarah has finished. She sits back, surveying her work...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          It's the pain that brings people back. It makes us strong again.
          
           
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE as he turns towards us. A slash of light
          illuminates the signature black and white war-paint of the Crow
          in all its glory. Ashe looks like a dark saint.

          on his motorcycle, hellfire burning in his eyes, his coat flapping
          behind him like a fallen angel's wings.
          
          THE CROW
          
          flies alongside Ashe.
          
          THE CROW
          
          lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse.
          
          Presently we hear Ashe's MOTORCYCLE approaching, then we see
          the front wheel of his bike pulling into the foreground.

          bags as a hand-powered printing press comes down, mass-producing
          the image of the imp giving us the thumbs up...
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL the lab set up in a maze of barrells. The
          walls are stained from the toxic fumes. Blacked-out windows sweat
          with moisture. There are heating mantles rigged with flasks and
          condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients like battery
          acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby are dozens of 50-gallon
          drums containing the finished product.
          
          Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing
          to snoot some of Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring
          lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken participant
          gets gored.
          
          Suddenly the power in the lab goes out, the TV screen sputters
          and goes dark.

          Spider Monkey whirls around, startled. Ashe is sitting cross-legged
          on one of the tables, grinning like a black leather Buddha.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          ASHE
          
          You have to learn to look beyond the mask.
          
           
          
          Ashe jumps down from the table, walking into the light. Spider
          Monkey's eyes widen in recognition.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          No way, man...we put you under...you and that little snot-nosed
          kid...
          
           
          
          Ashe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums. He blows
          a handful of the Trinity dust at Spider Monkey. Spider Monkey,
          terminally spooked, reaches back to the counter behind him, searching
          for something...
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Ashe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head.

          BOOM! ASHE
          
          puts a bullet through his own forehead. His head snaps backward
          and his body collapses onto the floor. Spider Monkey creeps forward
          toward Ashe's body...
          
          ASHE
          
          springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a table
          of chemicals. Bottles SHATTER on the floor, spilling their toxic
          contents.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          What are you?! What the fuck are you?!
          
           
          
          Ashe leans in so he's eye to eye with Spider Monkey.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I wasn't sure at first. Now I know. I'm the boiling man, Monkey.
          I'm the plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born. All
          your nightmares rolled into one.
          
           
          
          Ashe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket. He scrapes
          his thumb-nail over the head, igniting it.

          on Deacon Street!
          
           
          
          WHOOSH! Ashe blows the match out.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Congratulations, monkey. You just bought yourself a fighting
          chance.
          
           
          
          Ashe reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a deck of cards.
          He fans them out, points...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Pick a card, monkey.
          
           
          
          Spider Monkey slowly extends his hand, half-expecting Ashe to
          pounce on him. He pulls a card out.
          
          Spider Monkey tosses the card down, face up. He's got the Jack
          of Hearts. he smiles tentatively. Ashe pulls out a card of his
          own and flips it around - the King of Clubs.

          emerges from the raging conflagration, walking right through
          the flames, indifferent to the heat. A flurry of the tiny glassine

          get-up perched on a stool. In a forgiving light, she might even
          be beautiful.
          
          An LED display starts counting down from sixty - the seconds

          assault on Nemo.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          ...two crows joy...
          
           
          
          Nemo starts dragging his broken body across the floor. He finds
          himself face to face with an anatomically-correct blow-up sex
          doll - the kind with a built-in pre-recorded memory chip.
          
           
          
          DOLL
          
          Ooh, oh baby, I like it like that. You're so good. You're so
          good...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Three crows a letter, four crows a boy...
          
           
          
          Ashe HEAVES Nemo back the other way, sending him SMASHING into
          the front counter. Peep-O-Rama tokens go flying, bouncing and
          spinning every which way...
          
          CLOSE ON A SPINNING TOKEN
          
          On one side of the coin the eye is open, on the other it's closed
          - this creates the illusion of the eye blinking.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Five crows silver, six crows gold...
          
           
          
          Nemo utters a half-sob and rolls over, feebly wiping away the
          blood which is clouding his eyes.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Seven crows a secret never to be told.
          
           
          
          NEMO
          
          ...please, please just stop...
          
           
          
          Ashe pries open Nemo's eyes with his fingers.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You killed my son, Nemo. You took away the only piece of light
          left in my soul.
          
           
          
          NEMO
          
          We had to! Judah's orders. Never leave any witnesses! We didn't
          have a choice!
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          We always have a choice.
          
           
          
          Ashe plunges his fingers into Nemo's eyes - killing him off-camera.
          He lifts up his now blood-covered hands and turns...
          
          Just then, Holly Daze bursts out into the hall. She sees Ashe
          and YELPS, certain her number's up. Ashe grabs her by the wrist,
          spinning her around.
          
           
          
          HOLLY DAZE
          
          (CRINGING)
          
          ...no...
          
           
          
          Ashe touches her face and sees a split-second FLASH of...
          
          HOLLY DAZE DANCING
          
          Jump-cut bump and grind, CAT-CALLS, LAUGHTER, the distorted faces
          of men leering with their hungry eyes, tongues and sweaty palms
          and heavy breath and I wanna be your fucking dog, baby, and...
          
          BANG! ASHE
          
          shuts his eyes, reeling...
          
          Ashe looks up at Holly - one victim to another. His eyes burn
          a laser beam into her soul.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          If you value what you've lost, you'll walk away from this place
          and never look back.
          
           
          
          Holly Daze nods with conviction. Ashe releases her. She bolts
          like a rabbit flushed from cover.

          Curve ROARS UP on his motorcycle, followed by Kali and a car-load
          of ENFORCERS. The team grab their weapons, head for the porno
          shop...
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          Inside!
          
           
          
          Kali leads the crew of killers into the porno shop. But Curve
          stops, sensing something. He spins around...
          
          THE CROW
          
          is sitting atop one of the cars, watching him.
          
           
          
          INT. PEEP-O-RAMA, BACK CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Kali and Curve move down the dark corridor. The PORN ACTRESS
          VOICES from the vid-booths continue their ORGIASTIC MOANS, but
          one voice in particular stand out.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          Nemo?
          
           
          
          DOLL'S VOICE
          
          Ooh, oh baby, you're so good...
          
           
          
          CAMERA FINDS NEMO'S BODY
          
          at the end of the corridor, lounging in the arms of the sex doll
          which is still repeating its tinny refrain. Nemo's neck has been
          snapped and his head hangs at an awkward angle.
          
           
          
          DOLL
          
          ...oh! Oh yea, that's the spot. Do me, baby. Do me.
          
           
          
          There's a folded piece of paper shoved into Nemo's mouth. Curve
          pries it out. The paper unfolds like one of those snowflake cut-outs
          we used to make in grade school - only this cut-out is of a crow.
          
          Written across the paper crow are the following words:
          
          " I KNOW WHY JESUS WEPT"
          
           
          
          A phone on the wall is RINGING. RINGING and RINGING. Finally,
          Curve leans in, snatches up he receiver...
          
           
          
          ASHE'S VOICE
          
          Do you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve?
          
           
          
          At the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear.
          
           
          
          ASHE'S VOICE
          
          A murder. A murder of crows. Think about it.
          
           
          
          CLICK! The line goes dead. Furious, Curve tears the phone from
          the wall, HEAVING it across the porno shop.

          Ashe exits a phone booth, leaving the receiver dangling. A DOG
          BARKS nearby, followed by the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING. Ashe
          turns and sees...
          
          A GROUP OF CHILDREN running away, giggling, their FOOTSTEPS receding
          into the night.
          
          A BLACK DOG trots toward Ashe. The children have tied a plastic
          skull mask to the dog's head. The skull dog trots up the street
          towards...
          
          A SMALL, INNER-CITY LATINO CHURCH
          
          sandwiched between two derelict buildings. The doors are open
          - there's a path of marigold petals leading up the front steps.
          The skull dog trots up the steps and enters.
          
           
          
          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe moves into the sanctuary. He watches from the rear, entranced.
          PEOPLE are scattered amongst the pews.
          
          At the altar is a lavish offrenda - an offering of food and drink
          for the wandering dead decorated with sugar skulls and floral
          garlands. Amidst the decorations are photos of departed loved
          ones. There are tiers of candles surrounding these, scores of
          them.
          
          An ELDERLY PRIEST emerges from a confessional, looking to Ashe
          with a raised eyebrow..."Next?".
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Can I help you?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I'm sorry, Father, I was just watching...
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Our doors are open.
          
           
          
          The Priest moves to a candelabra and lights some tapers.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What is this for?
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Dias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead. We light the candles
          for our loved ones - so that they might find their way back to
          earth and share in the pleasures of the living.
          
           
          
          Ashe watches an OLD WOMAN place a toy motorcycle in front of
          a picture of a child.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Tomorrow night we will celebrate. The people will dance, sing...
          
          (indicating Ashe's makeup)
          
          ...many will wear masks.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Why?
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Some spirits linger here too long. They become confused, mistaking
          themselves for the living. They have to be frightened away.
          
           
          
          The priest nods to Ashe and moves down the aisle to the next
          candelabra.
          
          A LITTLE BOY
          
          is watching Ashe from one of the back pews. He clutches a striped
          ball. He drops it.
          
          The boy rolls the ball across the floor to Ashe. Ashe kneels
          and catches it, rolling it back. The boy smiles.
          
           
          
          BOY
          
          Santa Muerte.
          
           
          
          Unnerved, Ashe retreats out of the sanctuarly, letting the night's
          shadows swallow him up once more.

          Sarah sits by her paintings. Gabriel suddenly stands, arching
          his back, hair standing on end.
          
          ASHE
          
          appears on the ledge of the broken window, crouching there like
          a gargoyle in silhouette.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (hesitant, but relieved)
          
          You came back...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Heaven wouldn't have me and Hell was afraid I'd take the place
          over.
          
           
          
          Ashe drops into the loft.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I needed to see you again.
          
           
          
          Ashe moves towards Sarah's paintings, pausing to study the one
          of the woman being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover.
          He touches the woman's face.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          She looks like you.
          
           
          
          After a long moment, Sarah responds.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I paint what I see.
          
           
          
          Ashe approaches Sarah. He points to the wedding ring which hands
          from her neck.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          SARAH
          
          It belonged to a friend.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          A better place.
          
           
          
          Sarah turns the ring around her finger, fidgeting with it.
          
           
          
          SARAH

          Sarah reaches for a cigarette and lights up, taking a long drag.
          Ashe notices a number of scars on her forearm, possibly some
          track marks...
          
          Sarah catches him looking, self-consciously pulls her hand back.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (meeting his gaze)
          
          I left Detroit because I wanted to put the past behind me.
          
          (STRUGGLING)
          
          The problem is, I know how it ends. Blood. Violence. I don't
          want a part of it anymore.
          
           
          
          Gabriel approaches Ashe. He crouches, runs his fingers along
          the cat's back.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          SARAH
          
          You go back.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What if I don't want to go back?
          
           
          
          Sarah looks away.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Judah, Curve, and Kali gathered around the

          SEES the knick-knacks and mementos gathered there, then SEES
          the ceramic irony mask which hangs above. Ashe approaches, reaching
          a hand out to trace its features.
          
          At the bottom of the mirror, a FADED POSTCARD has been tucked

          Ashe catches himself, setting the postcard down. He turns his

          Sarah stands, drawing near. She reaches out to console him, touching
          his shoulder. She alone, among all the souls of the world, understands
          the isolation that is consuming Ashe.

          in his eyes...
          
          Something unspoken passes between them. Sarah leans into Ashe,
          tentative, eyes searching. It's one of those fragile moments

          of back-alley JUNKIES. He stumbles into a pile of garbage, scatters
          some rats...
          
          Curve makes for his bike, which is parked nearby. He fumbles
          with the key, hits the starter switch...
          
          Ashe comes flying off from a second story fire escape, landing
          atop a car roof on all fours, popping the windows.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Time's up, Curve.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Fuck you, bird-dick!
          
           
          
          Curve jerks his bike towards the street and guns it...
          
           
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Curve zooms by a bridal shop-sees his own reflection in the window.
          
           
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Curve SHRIEKS, turns into the Alley, tachometer red-lining. He
          glances behind him...The crow flies by.
          
          THE CROW
          
          plunges down from the night sky, wings flapping madly, quickly
          gaining on Curve like the breath of death.
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe, in a dream-like state, races along.
          
           
          
          EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Curve leans in low, trying to urge his bike on by will-power
          alone. He races by a warehouse, veering off the road onto the
          railroad tracks.
          
          UP ABOVE,
          
          Ashe appears on the overpass, riding on his own motorcycle, matching
          Curve's speed.
          
          THE CROW
          
          soars higher for a bird's eye view, tracking Curve's progress
          as it sweeps past chimneys, swerves around billboards, ducks
          under laundry lines...
          
          ON ASHE
          
          as he ROCKETS along the overpass. The Crow lands on his shoulder.
          Ahead is a break in the guard rail. Ashe cuts sharply to the
          right, taking the motorcycle airborne through the break in the
          rail and...
          
          ASHE
          
          ...lands on the surface street some thirty feet below! Ashe is
          now just behind Curve.

          Sarah is back at work on the painting of the woman being cradled
          by her lover. Gabriel, who's lounging nearby, suddenly looks
          up and HISSES.
          
          UP ABOVE THEM
          
          the Crow lands on the skylight, staring down at Sarah, watching...
          
          There's a KNOCK at her door. Sarah approaches, looks through
          the peephole...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Who is it?
          
           
          
          SARAH'S POV (THROUGH FISH-EYE PEEPHOLE)
          
          Kali stands there, cradling an automatic. She's flanked by TWO
          IDENTICAL TWIN THUGS. Kali FIRES into the lock...
          
           
          
          EXT. TUNNEL MOUTH - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The chase continues. Curve approaches the bridge doing well past
          ninety. Abruptly, he cuts down a roadway which parallels the
          river. There's a chain-link running across the mouth of the tunnel.
          
          Up ahead is a hole in the fence leading down to a tunnel spillway.
          Curve guides his bike through the hole...
          
           
          
          INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Curve speeds into the dark tunnel, splashing through puddles
          of water, whipping past graffiti. As he nears the mouth at the
          other end, Curve brakes hard, TIRES SQUEALING, almost going down...
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          We are now beneath the bridge. It's a stone-cold dead-end. The
          roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out into the concrete
          river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          We hear the ROAR of an approaching motorcycle, then an engine
          cutting out. Curve looks back the way he came...
          
          AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TUNNEL
          
          Ashe's siilhouette steps into view. He's on foot now, clutching
          the sawed-off shotgun. He lets loose a LAUGH which chills Curve
          to the bone.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "I have a rendezvous with Death, on some scarred slope of battered
          hill..."
          
           
          
          Ashe starts into the tunnel. His WET FOOTSTEPS echo off the weeping
          walls...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "God knows, 'twere better to be deep where love throbs out in
          blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath..."
          
           
          
          As Ashe draws closer, his death-like face emerges from the gloom
          - a ghastly visage floating in the ether...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "But I have a rendezvous with Death. And I to my pledged word
          am true..."
          
           
          
          Ashe stops some twenty feet away, grinning like the Cheshire
          Cat.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "I shall not fail that rendezvous."
          
           
          
          Silence like knives. Ashe and Curve facing one another. Curve
          is tense, dry-mouthed...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          You think i'm afraid of you, you fucking freak?! YOU THINK I'M
          AFRAID?!!
          
           
          
          Curve SCREAMS and guns his cycle forward, rolling the throttle
          all the way open - a kamikaze run aimed straight at Ashe.
          
          Ashe stands his groupd, lifts the shotgun, FIRST at Curve's customized
          teardrop gas tank. There's the woman doing the wild thing with
          Death and...
          
          BOOM! CURVE'S MOTORCYCLE
          
          disintegrates beneath him, breaking apart into a RUSHING COMET
          OF FLAMING WRECKAGE. Shrapnel skids along the tunnel walls, SPEWING
          SPARKS.
          
          CURVE
          
          lies on the garbage-strewn tunnel floor in a spreading pool of
          blood - burnt, battered, a barb of steel sticking up from his
          chest. Still, Curve has one glorious, giddy moment where he thinks
          he's actually succeeded in defeeating Ashe, then...
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          as Ashe steps through the gasoline flames.
          
          Curve's elation vaporizes.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Can you hear me, Curve?
          
           
          
          Curve offers a weak nod.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You're going to die now.
          
           
          
          Curve tries to speak, blood spills from his mouth. Ashe places
          a finger to his lips.
          
          Ashe drops down, kneeling over Curve's chest.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          People used to put coins in the mouths of the dead. Do you know
          why? So they could pay the ferryman to take them across the river
          Styx.
          
          (reaching to Curve's ear)
          
          What's this?
          
           
          
          In a parody of a stage magician, Ashe retrieves one of the Peep-O-Rama
          tokens from Curve's ear. The embossed eye logo flashes.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Open your mouth, Curve.
          
           
          
          Curve,s eyes are wide, filled with terror. He MOANS.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Shhh. It's not so bad. Trust me. I've been there.
          
           
          
          Curve slowly opens his mouth. Tears run from his eyes. Ashe places
          the coin on Curve's tongue, like a priest administering a Holy
          wafer.
          
          Ashe stands, grabs Curve by the coat collar. He pulls him back
          towards the end of the tunnel...

          waters edge.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I want to thank you for showing me my pain, Curve. You made me
          what I am.
          
           
          
          ON ASHE
          
          As he releases Curve, letting the current carry him away. Ashe
          stands, tracking Curve's progress.
          
          ON CURVE
          
          as he floats downstream, limbs outstretched, consciousness fading
          fast.
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          GHOSTLY FACES stare down at him from the girders - people who
          have made their home in the underbelly of the bridge which stretches
          overhead.
          
          A WOMAN lets loose a cloud of marigold petals. They flutter down
          around Curve, swirling in the currents.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          the petals have clustered around Curve's body in the shape of
          a Crow. Curve continues to float downstream towards an estuary,
          borne away on the wings of the bird.

          down, lowering his head. Whether out of respect for the dead
          or his own condition, we'll never know.
          
          After a minute, Ashe lifts his head again and stands. It's time

          KALI
          
          who had been standing still amidst the shadows, now moves from

          Judah's tower. He's waiting for you there.
          
           
          
          As Kali steps closer we see that she's dressed for war -- a katana
          secured in a black scabbard, twin daggers on each hip, a bandoleer
          of throwing stars.

          Kali unsheathes her katana. The blade edge catches the streetlight's
          glare coming in from the window.

          Kali comes at Ashe blindingly fast. She spins and cartwheels
          end over end, somersaulting. As she lands, Kali shifts into Ginsu-mode,
          her blade a whirling blur...
          
          Ashe ducks under the blade, trapping Kali's sword arm. He twists
          his hands, SNAPPING her arm...

          PULL BACK to reveal Sarah curled up on the cold tile floor, a
          number of candles burning nearby. Sarah sits up, disoriented.
          Upon moving her arm she finds that it's been shackled to one
          of the pillars via a long chain.
          
          Sarah wastes a few moments tugging at her tether, trying to snap
          one of the links, but it's no good.
          
          Frustrated, Sarah looks around, trying to get her bearings...
          
          SIBYL
          
          is standing a few yards away, cloaked in darkness, head bowed.
          Sarah didn't notice her at first.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Where am I?
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          The Tower. Everyone finds their way here eventually.
          
           
          
          Sarah rises from the floor, a little unsteady. She moves towards
          Sibyl, reaches out to touch her shoulder. The prophetess abruptly
          lifts her head, causing her hood to fall back. Sarah takes a
          step back, GASPING...
          
          SIBYL'S EMPTY EYE SOCKETS
          
          have been sewn shut with black thread.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          My God. What happened to you...?
          
           
          
          JUDAH (O.S.)
          
          Fate happened to her.
          
           
          
          Sarah spins...
          
          JUDAH
          
          emerges from the gloom, almost as if he were materializing from
          the shadows themselves.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Sibyl's been cursed with the gift of prophecy. She sees things
          that are fated to happen...
          
          (BEAT)
          
          She cut her eyes out with a carving knife because she wanted
          to make the visions stop...
          
           
          
          Judah brushes the back of his hand affectionately against Sibyl's
          cheek.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          ...but that only made the visions stronger, didn't it, dear?
          
           
          
          Sibyl turns her head away from Judah, shunning his caress.
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          I've learned to live with my affliction.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Don't we all.
          
           
          
          Sarah backs away from Judah, wary.

          I saw a need, I exploited it. It's all economics, Sarah. Supply
          and demand.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Why did you bring me here?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I'm glad you asked that, Sarah. You've got a very important part
          to play in this little drama of ours. You see, I intend to capture
          the Crow...
          
           
          
          Judah draws near, devouring Sarah with his hungry eyes. USING
          A JAGGED FINGERNAIL, HE INCISES A CROSS INTO HER FOREHEAD.

          Kali comes CRASHING through the window, falling down to the sidewalk
          below. She lands atop a wrecked car, snapping her back in two...
          
          CLOSE ON KALI
          
          lies on the ground, her limbs twisted at awkward angles. She
          MOANS, somehow still alive.
          
          KALI'S POV
          
          as Ashe approaches. The Crow flits in from off-screen, landing
          on his shoulder. Watching Kali with it's curious golden eyes.
          
          As Ashe draws near, Kali tries to rise. The most she can do is
          lift her head.
          
           
          
          KALI

          Ashe simply shakes his head.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          You...have to.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          My job is to send you to hell. You're in it.
          
           
          
          Kali stares at Ashe in disbelief, her stoic warrior's mien quickly
          evaporating.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          There's no...honor in this. It's my...death. I've won it..
          
           
          
          Ashe turns and starts away.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Me, too.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          Wait! Where are you going?! Wait! You can't...do this! You can't
          do this!!!
          
           
          
          But Ashe doesn't turn back. He leaves Kali in the cold, wet street,
          ignoring her pathetic laments.
          
          Ashe continues on to the end of the alley...
          
          THE CROW
          
          lands on Ashe's outstretched hand.
          
          The Crow takes wing, lifting its way up into the night.
          
          Ashe fires up the motorcycle's engine, tearing away from Sarah's
          apartment in a cloud of smoke.

          JUDAH
          
          Have you ever read Dante's Inferno? It says that the only true
          path through Hell lies at its center. If you want to escape it
          -- you have to go further in.
          
           
          
          Judah lowers himself into a chair.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          When I was a boy I fell through the ice of a lake. I remember
          seeing the sky through the ice above me, close enough to touch.
          The world grew cold around me. Dark. Eventually my heart stopped
          beating. And in that moment, I died.
          
           
          
          Judah sweeps his hand through one of the candle flames, then
          pinches the flame out of existence. A tiny wisp of smoke trails
          up into shadow.
          
          Judah settles back in his chair, overcome by a memory that for
          him has never lost its vibrancy.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          A half-hour later I awoke on an operating table. I had returned
          to the world of flesh and bone -- But I brought a knowledge back
          with me...
          
          (tapping his forehead)
          
          Forbidden knowledge.
          
           
          
          Judah leans in close to Sarah, his lambent eyes glowing like
          hot coals. As Judah continues, Sarah fingers the ankh which hangs
          from her neck.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I've been living on borrowed time ever since. I've always known
          Death would be coming for me.

          I see now that your friend is the one I've been waiting for.

          You can't stop him.

          There is a way to defeat Death... and that's to trade places

          piloted by a man in a devil mask suddenly looms up in front of

          barricades. There's some kind of street fiesta going on...
          
          Ashe swerves, BRAKING HARD to avoid hitting the carriage. Ashe's
          bike slips out from under him and Ashe goes CRASHING into the
          barricades. But even as the carriage's skull-faced costumed occupants
          rush up to help him...

          Sarah sits within one of the pools of illumination far below,
          still bound to the bed by the chain. Judah and Sibyl are nowhere
          in sight.
          
          THE CROW
          
          flies down from the rafters, landing on the floor at Sarah's
          feet. It CAWS at her, trying to communicate.

          aside the curtain of the camera obscura. He reaches up to a lever

          to strike at Judah with its beak and claws...
          
          ... but Judah secures his grip around the bird's throat, pulling
          it out. He pins the Crow to the focusing table of the camera

          way in is up.

          Ashe grabs a hold of one of the ornamental statues which crowd
          th ebuildint's facade. He pulls himself up, starting the daunting
          task of scaling the tower.

          Back to Judah and the Crow. The clouds being projected onto the
          camera table (and subsequently the Crow itself) are rushing at
          an unearthly speed. The create a surreal backdrop for the Crow's
          frenetically beating wings - in effect, a mockery of the bird
          flying.
          
           
          
          JUDAH

          from their roost...
          
          Ashe pulls back, one of his hands slipping free. He dangles there
          for a moment, hanging by the tenuous grasp of his fingertips.
          
          SIBYL
          
          who has been lurking in the shadows, suddenly lifts her head
          up...

          JUDAH
          
          Not for long.
          
           
          
          Judah raises the misericord up high. Sarah turns her head away
          as...

          in agony as he suffers the pain of the Crow through their symbiotic
          link. Ashe stares down at his hand in disbelief...

          against his will. A second stigma wound appears.
          
          He slips, tumbling to the next ledge down but catching himself
          on his fingertips. He hazards a look down...

          Day of the Dead CELEBRANTS crowd the streets far below.

          It takes every ounce of Ashe's strength to keep from letting
          go. He tightens his white-knuckled grip on the ledge above.
          
          Shaking terribly, trying to fight back the pain, Ashe continues
          to climb. He reaches up to a...
          
          STONE MAIDEN
          
          which protrudes from the building's facade. The maiden's face
          has been all but worn bare by the harsh elements.
          
          Ashe clutches the back of the maiden in a parody of a lover's
          embrace. Using the statue for support, he drags himself back
          up to relative safety. Now Ashe is face to face with the maiden,
          staring into its blind stone eyes.

          Ashe whispers the word like a mantra, using it to urge him on.
          Steeling himself again, fighting the burning pain, Ashe resumes
          his climb. He's on autopilot now, just trying to reach the campanile,
          which at this point, seems hopelessly unattainable.
          
          THE SKY ABOVE

          to break.

          The Day of the Dead celebrants swirl around us, Judah's Tower
          rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat built to challenge
          the gods. The CROWD has been worked up into a frenzy. Everyone
          is singing and dancing. MUSIC blasts from loudspeakers...
          
          ASHE
          
          comes CRASHING DOWN atop a small vending stall filled to the
          brim with flowers an sugar skulls. Time slows as a flurry of
          golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form.

          The Crow is dead, transfixed by the gleaming misericords. Blood
          is pooling beneath black flight feathers.
          
          Judah steps back, momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of
          his crime.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          It's done.
          
           
          
          Judah looks to the camera obscura's table. The blood from the
          Crow has completely covered the table's concave surface, filling
          it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl. The end result
          is an eerie reflecting pool.
          
          AS WE WATCH, THE IMAGE OF THE CLOUDS
          
          cast by the camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve,
          only to be replaced by Judah's own, shimmering reflection.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          With a shaking hand, Judah dips his fingers into the pooling
          blood and begins to paint his face. A swatch of blood over one
          eye, then a swatch over the other. A long, bloody smear over
          his lips...
          
          The action harkens back to the moment when Sarah painted Ashe's
          face - a parallel ritual turned on its head.

          Relaxed, peaceful, even. For a moment, we aren't sure whether
          or not Ashe's soul has fled.
          
          The peripheral noise from the street festival dies away. We're
          in the eye of the hurricane now. Once again, time seems to shudder
          to a stop. And the only thing we hear are...

          Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS.

          but waken he does...

          The CRIES of the crows grow louder as the sky above becomes darker.
          
          A shadow passes over Danny's face. He Seems Saddened. For a moment,
          it seems as if another entity creeps into Danny's voice.

          Ashe hesitates a moment, realizing the enormity of what he is
          about to do. It's an agonizing choice.

          As Danny says his parting words, the SOUNDS of the world around
          them come rushing back with startling clarity. Danny starts to

          is broken. Was he dreaming...?
          
          No, there's Danny slipping back into the crows, the mask pulled
          down over his face once again.
          
          Ashe reaches for Danny, spinning him around, pulling off the
          mask...
          
          ...only it's not Danny! It's a drunken DWARF with fucked-up teeth
          who's laughing his ass of at Ashe. Ashe recoils, horrified, then
          spins around, suddenly finding himself face to face with...
          
          JUDAH
          
          standing just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of
          his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face. His eyes
          are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a
          feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his
          campanile.
          
          Judah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close
          so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath
          -- two sides of a coin.
          
           
          
          JUDAH

          Judah.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          In the flesh.
          
           
          
          Judah flings Ashe backwards...
          
          Ashe reaches his hand into his coat, pulling out a .45. He FIRES
          into Judah's chest - once, twice, thrice...
          
          Judah doesn't even stagger, he just keeps on grinning. Wisps
          of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest.
          
          Ashe stares at Judah, dumbfounded.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What...are...you?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I'm your shadow, Ashe. Every angel's got a devil. Didn't you
          know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school?
          
           
          
          Judah lashes out with the rope. Ashe spins and falters. Incredibly,
          he finds himself feeling pain.
          
          Judah follows with a series of blows, each more savage than the
          next, driving Ashe back...
          
          Ashe stumbles, falls to his hands and knees. He reaches to his
          mouth, his hand comes away spattered with blood. Ashe shakes
          his head to clear it.
          
          Judah kicks Ashe in the face, knocking him onto his back...
          
          ...but Ashe springs back to his feet. He tries to strike Judah.
          Judah catches Ashe's hand and squeezes tight. We hear bones snapping.
          
          CRACK! Judah smashes out with his other fist, Ashe spins around
          and collapses...
          
          Ashe tries to push himself up by his hands. He coughs, spitting
          up more blood, crawls forward...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What... did you do to me...?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I've tasted the blood of the Crow and taken your power.
          
           
          
          WHOOSH! Judah whips the rope about, snapping the end around Ashe's
          neck, dragging him off his feet.
          
          Judah pulls Ashe forward, crouching over him like a spider ready
          to devour its prey.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You're flesh and blood now, Ashe. You can die like any other
          man.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Go to hell.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Already been there. And I must confess, I liked what I saw.

          Sarah sobs quietly, still chained to the pillar. A figure suddenly
          appears at her side -- Sibyl. Sarah looks up...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          What...?
          
           
          
          Sibyl produces a key from within her robes. She places the key
          in the lock on Sarah's manacles. With a turn of the key, the
          manacles fall away and Sarah is free.
          
          Sarah looks back at the blind oracle, uncertain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Why are you doing this?
          
           
          
          Sibyl fixes Sarah with her blind stare.
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          Ashe needs you now. More than ever.
          
           
          
          Sibyl raises her other hand. She's holding one of the misericords
          which she extends to Sarah.
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          Go to him.
          
           
          
          Sarah takes the misericord and racees for the end of the campanile,
          towards a beckoning doorway and a stairwell beyond. Printed on
          a grime-smeared placard nearby are the words...
          
          "THIS IS NOT AN EXIT"
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes through the doorway, heedless.

          Judah plants his foot on Ashe's chest, tightening the chain around
          Ashe's throat.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Looks like the dead have forsaken you, my friend.
          
           
          
          Ashe clutches at the rusty chain links which bite into his flesh,
          choking.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Look at you, bleeding like a stuck pig. Where's your precious
          strength? Where's your power?
          
          (drawing closer, whispering)
          
          You're nothing now, Ashe, not even a ghost.
          
           
          
          Judah rises. He grabs a hold of the chain, pulling...
          
          ASHE
          
          down the street. Ashe SCREAMS as his body is dragged across the
          asphalt...

          Sarah rushes into a rickety old elevator, pulling the accordion-style
          security gate shut. She punches the "DOWN" arrow on the tarnished
          control panel. With a lurch and HUM the elevator car starts its
          journey downward.
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY STREET, MOVIE PALACE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Judah has dragged Ashe over to the East side of the street, in
          front of an old movie palace. He leaps atop one of the vending
          stalls and clambers onto the marquee itself.
          
          JUDAH
          
          shouts to the crowds below, his eyes on fire.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You want death?! Here he is, people!!! Take a good look!!!
          
           
          
          Even as Ashe fights to free himself of the chain, Judah loops
          one end of it over a street lamp. He jumps from the marquee,
          using his body weight to pull Ashe from the ground...
          
          ASHE
          
          is dragged up into the air, dangling above the faces of the crowd.
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY STREET, JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes out the front entrance of the tower, into the Day
          of the Dead crowd which swarms below. She pushes through the
          mob, trying to fight her way across the street.
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY STREET - MOVIE PALACE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe swings like a puppet from Judah's improvised hangman's noose.
          His coat and short have been all but torn to shreds.
          
          Judah drags down on the chain harder, lifting Ashe even higher,
          tightening the noose. He secures the chain on a hydrant, then
          strolls forward, inspecting his work. Judah circles Ashe, grinning
          like the cat who swallowed the canary.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Now don't we look pretty...
          
           
          
          Ashe struggles, choking, causing...
          
          THE TATTERED PAINTING
          
          of Danny's that Ashe had kept in his coat pocket to fall free.
          It flutters to the ground, landing at Judah's feet.
          
          Judah kneels, picking it up. As he unfolds the painting, we see
          that it has been stained with Ashe's own blood. He tilts it this
          way and that -- as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of
          the piece.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Nice. If you prick him, does he not bleed?
          
           
          
          Judah looks up at Ashe, his eyes full of crazed humor, then he
          very deliberately tears the painting to shreds, letting the pieces
          fall away into the night wind.
          
          Judah reaches for metal rod, lashing out at Ashe's bare, bloodied
          back...
          
          WHACK! Ashe SCREAMS. Judah is hell-bent on beating Ashe into
          oblivion. With every stroke of the switch the crowd CHEERS.
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE
          
          His eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede...
          
          ASHE'S POV
          
          The swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front
          and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk and LAUGHING, jeering
          at Ashe, the dangling fool. It's a scene out of Hell...
          
          .. and behind Judah, a familiar figure pushing her way to the
          front of the crowd...
          
          SARAH
          
          lunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller
          aside...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get away from him!
          
           
          
          Judah turns. Sarah drives the misericord into Judah's eye. Judah,
          momentarily blinded, falls back...
          
          Sarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant...
          
          ASHE
          
          falls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over the street lamp.
          He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back
          up...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Sarah, get back!
          
           
          
          Too late. Judah has torn the misericord from his eye. He rushes
          up to Sarah and...
          
          ...THUNK! Drives it deep into her chest.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          SARAH!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle.
          She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the
          wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then
          falls back.
          
          Silence now as the crowd begins to back away. The mood has shifted.
          
          Ashe drops by Sarah's side. She stares up at the sky, eyes wide
          with wonder...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          The crows...I can see them coming...
          
           
          
          SARAH'S POV
          
          Once again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the
          sky.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been
          burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason
          is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled
          animal fury.
          
          Ashe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling
          back into a nest of scaffolding. One of the pipes punches clear
          through Judah's chest, impaling him!
          
          Judah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck
          through it. He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but
          even so, he's laughing hysterically...
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You can't stop me anymore, Ashe. You don't have the power.
          
           
          
          Ashe's eyes boil with hatred.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          If it were just me, you'd be right, Judah. But I have an eternity
          of pain to call upon...
          
           
          
          Ashe lifts his hands up, exposing his bleeding palms.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          And the pain gives me strength.
          
           
          
          ASHE'S PALMS
          
          As we watch the stigmata close themselves up, blood drawing itself
          back into the wounds.
          
          Ashe raises his arms to the sky, gesturing to the crows which
          spin high above his head.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          TAKE HIM!!!
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal
          wave. They descend on Judah as one entity, SCREAMING down from
          the heavens like a storm of razor blades.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          NO!!!
          
           
          
          We get one final glimpse of horrified Judah's face, eyes wide
          with terror, before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him.
          
          JUDAH
          
          lets loose a DEATH-SHRIEK that all but splits the sky as the
          myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb.
          
          DOWN IN THE STREET,
          
          Ashe returns to Sarah's side, lifting her up off the ground and
          cradling her in his arms.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You can't die, Sarah... I stayed for you.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (GASPING)
          
          There's a balance that needs to be kept...someone had to cross
          over...
          
           
          
          Sarah takes a ragged breath, wincing as a wave of pain washes
          over her.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I didn't want it to be you...
          
           
          
          Sarah looks up at Ashe, tries her level best to smile. She's
          at death's door now - one foot already over the threshold. Her
          face is pale, having lost so much blood. Tears spill down Ashe's
          cheeks, causing the war-paint makeup to run in rivulets.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (in anguish)
          
          I can't go with you, Sarah. I have to stay here now.
          
          (cursing his fate)
          
          I have to stay.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Do you love me?
          
           
          
          Ashe nods.
          
          Sarah reaches down to the wedding ring which hangs from her neck
          on the chain. She tugs at the chain, snapping it apart. She holds
          the ring out to Ashe.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Take...this...
          
           
          
          Ashe takes the ring from Sarah. She closes Ashe's hand around
          the ring, gripping his fist tightly.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I'll wait for you. Forever, if I have to.
          
           
          
          She shuts her eyes, riding through another wave of pain.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Oh God...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Listen...if two people really love each other...
          
           
          
          She inhales sharply. Breathing has become a labor for her now.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          ...nothing can keep them apart.
          
          (her voice fading)
          
          ...nothing.
          
           
          
          Ashe nods, trying to let this thought reassure him. It's the
          only thing he has left to cling to.
          
          SARAH'S POV
          
          Ashe's face, surrounded by a nimbus of light. We're falling away
          from him. Down, down, down. And as we fall, we hear a FLUTTERING
          OF WINGS.
          
          ON SARAH'S FACE
          
          Her eyes lose focus. Her head goes slack in Ashe's arms. She's
          gone.
          
          Ashe lowers his lips to her, kissing her one final time.
          
          Ashe cradles Sarah's lifeless body in his arms, gently rocking
          back and forth, tears streaming down his cheeks.
          
          And as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors
          the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying
          in the arms of her lover, surrounded by a gallery of skull-masked
          celebrants.
          
          Ashe stands, lifting Sarah in his arms. He turns to leave...
          
          THE DAY OF THE DEAD CROWD
          
          slowly part for him, revealing a path of marigold petals leading
          away down the street. It's almost as if, by silent consensus,
          the crowd has come to understand what has happened here this
          night.
          
          ASHE
          
          moves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his arms. The people
          close ranks behind him and we...
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sibyl stands over the camera obscura. On the table's focusing
          surface we see the street below.
          
          ASHE
          
          is carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through the crowd of silent
          witnesses.
          
          SIBYL
          
          nods to herself, satisfied. We see what might be a trace of a
          smile cross her lips.
          
          Sibyl turns and exits the camera obscura.
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sibyl approaches the table where the stag beetle is tethered.
          Removing a pair of scissors from within her robes, Sibyl cuts
          the thread which binds the beetle.
          
          THE STAG BEETLE,
          
          free at last, quickly scurries out of the box and across the
          table, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Sibyl follows suit, gathering her robes about her and stepping
          on into the darkness.
          
          DISSOLVE TO:
          
           
          
          EXT. INNER-CITY CHURCH - DAWN
          
           
          
          The same church we visited the night before. Ashe, still carrying
          Sarah in his arms, enters the sanctuary.
          
          The church is aglow with candles. Ashe lays Sarah's body down
          in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest,
          leaving her in a state of repose. He stands, taking in one last
          look.
          
          As Ashe moves to leave, he sees the elderly priest he had spoken
          to earlier.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Why are you still here?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Because I have nowhere left to go.
          
           
          
          Ashe steps past the priest, moving towards the doorway and the
          daylight beyond.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          What will you do, then?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (looking back)
          
          This city is filled with shadows. One more won't make it any
          darker.
          
           
          
          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN
          
           
          
          Ashe exits the church, finding haven in a shadowed doorway. He
          reaches into his pocket, removing the wedding ring Sarah had
          given to him...
          
          CLOSE ON THE RING
          
          as Ashe turns it over in his hands, seeing the word "FOREVER"
          inscribed on the inside of the band. He slips it on his finger.
          
           
          
          GRACE (O.S.)
          
          (CONCERNED)
          
          Are you all right?
          
           
          
          Ashe looks up to see...
          
          GRACE,
          
          the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at the beginning of the
          film. She's looking good now, clean of the poison that once possessed
          her. And damned if she isn't holding Gabriel in her arms.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Long night, huh?
          
           
          
          Gabriel MEOWS to Ashe. Ashe reaches out and scratches the cat's
          ear.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Isn't he cool? I found him on the street. I was going to take
          him home with me.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You should. Looks like he needs a home.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Well, see ya.
          
           
          
          She smiles at him and starts off down the street. Gabriel turns
          around in Grace's arms and peers back at Ashe from over her shoulder.
          
          Ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing light,
          watching them. We see just a hint of hope in his eyes - hope
          that someday he and Sarah will be reunited.
          
          As we hold on Ashe's face, Sarah's VOICE-OVER begins.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          I believe there's a place where the restless souls wanter...

          The same scene as the beginning of our film. We've made a circle.
          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying towards
          the camera in slow motion.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter
          Heaven...
          
           
          
          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK,
          galloping after the Crow.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day, they will be reunited...
          
           
          
          As the dark rider comes towards us, we realize that it's Sarah
          whose baleful eyes are now shining behind the irony mask war
          paint.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)

          Ashe is back on his bike, racing beneath the cathedral-like arches

          Ashe on the bike. Now we intercut between the two doomed lovers,
          each on their respective steeds. Worlds apart, and yet, somehow
          traveling the same road.
          
          We are intercutting faster and faster, until the sound of HOOFBEATS
          and the MOTORCYCLE'S ROAR are indistinguishable.
          
          Until the two figures themselves begin to blur.
          
          Faster and faster and faster until we...
          
          CUT TO BLACK.
          
          Over the darkness we hear Sarah's final words to Ashe:
          
           
          
          SARAH'S VOICE
          
          If two people really love each other, nothing can keep them apart...

          Nothing.

    As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink
    open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN
    near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind
    blowing, rattling a window.

                            A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
              What are you looking at?

              The wind, Mother... They say a
              hurricane is on its way... You've
              been asleep... I was waiting to
              see you...

1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1

    Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white
    enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
    An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green
    turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her
    blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's
    connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
    drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a
    Southern lilt.

                            DAISY
              If it wasn't for hurricanes we
              wouldn't have a hurricane season.

                            CAROLINE
              I've forgotten what the weather
              can be like here. I've lived with
              four seasons so many years now.

    We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER,
    in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the
    window...

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              I saw on the news they're
              predicting trouble...

                            DAISY
              1928 they stacked people like
              firewood to close a hole in a
              levee.

    But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 It all runs together... like a
                 fingerpainting... I feel like I'm
                 on a boat, drifting...

                               CAROLINE
                      (tenderly)
                 Can I do anything for you, Mother?
                 Make anything easier?

                                DAISY
                 Hmmm. There is nothing to do,
                 Caroline. This is what it is...
                 I'm finding it harder to keep my
                 eyes open... my mouth all filled
                 with cotton...

    And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her
    nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take
    it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.

                               DOROTHY BAKER
                 There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll
                 scratch yourself to ribbons...
                      (to Caroline)
                 It's their way of letting go...
                      (the finality)
                 ...prob'ly today.

    Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her
    admonition of death being so close at hand, makes
    everything even more present...

                               CAROLINE
                 Do you want more medication,
                 Mother? The doctor said you can
                 have all you want.

    Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline,
    seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to
    cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter,
    comforting her.

                               CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                 A friend told me she never had a
                 chance to say goodbye to her
                 mother.
                      (grateful to have the
                       chance)
                 I wanted to thank you, Mother, for
                 bringing me into this world. For
                 raising me so well.

    They hold each other for some time... They separate...
    And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
    about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in
    their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal
    question...

                            CAROLINE (CONT'D)
              Are you afraid?

                             DAISY
              Curious.   What comes next...

    She winces at some physical pain.

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              The pain's coming more steadily...
              Her breathing will falter soon...
              No need for her to suffer..

    She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes...
    drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a
    sound, crosses her mind... and she says...

                            DAISY
              They built that train station in
              1918. Your father was there the
              day it opened... He said a tuba
              band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...

2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2

    And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
    ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
    TRAIN STATION...

                            DAISY
              Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The
              finest clockmaker in all of the
              South built that clock...

3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3

    We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless
    array of clocks and watches...

                            DAISY'S (V.O.)
              His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr.
              Cake.

                                                                3A.



4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4

    The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to
    herself again... "Mr. Cake..."

5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5

    We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small,
    delicate hands, "Mr. Cake," working in his downstairs
    workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a
    handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                   4.

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 He was married to a Creole of
                 Evangeline Parish and they had a
                 son.

    Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.

                               DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from
                 birth, absolutely blind.

6   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917              6

    ...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 And when their son came of age,
                 like boys will do, he joined the
                 army. They saw him off at the old
                 train station.

7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7

    An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his
    parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
    soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his
    hat goodbye to his son...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 Oh how he worked, for months he
                 did nothing but work on the clock
                 for the great train station.

8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8

    The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at
    work...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 One day a letter came...

    Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her
    hand... She reads to her blind husband...

                               BLANCHE DEVEREUX
                 "I am sorry to inform you that
                 your son was killed fighting for
                 his country, at the battle of the
                 Marne. In the death of Sgt.
                 Martin Gateau I lose one of my
                 most trusted men.

                                BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D)
                  When I informed members of our
                  company he had fallen, on every
                  face could be seen the mark of
                  sorrow... ...we were in hope the
                  Lord would spare him to return
                  home together... Alas this was not
                  to be. I send along his pants,
                  shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and
                  haircomb."

                                DAISY (V.O.)
                  Mr. Gateau, done for the night,
                  went up to his bed.

     Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  And their son came home.

9    EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                9

     We see "Mr. Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding
     his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  They buried him where the Gateau
                  family had been buried for a
                  hundred and seven years...

10   EXT. NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1918                          10

     An old New Orleans cemetery, vines crawling the
     sepulchers.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Mr. Cake went back to work on his
                  clock... laboring to finish...

11   INT. THE CLOCK WORKSHOP, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1918        11

     Mr. Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up
     the clock back... finished at last.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  It was a morning to remember...
                  Papa said there were people
                  everywhere...

12   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918            12

     And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling
     of the clock. Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets
     alike...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                  6.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Even Teddy Roosevelt had come.

     And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt,
     in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders. We
     watch Mr. Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing
     the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape...
     He stands for a moment... and with a simple tug, releases
     the purple swath... People gasp at the magnificent
     clock... "Mr. Cake" winds the clock, which chimes a
     glorious chime... Pushed by an angel, the second-hand
     begins its eternal journey...going around... Everyone
     cheers... until they realize the clock is going the wrong
     way... traveling backwards in time... A man shouts, "It's
     running backwards!"

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  I made it this way... so that
                  perhaps, the boys who were lost in
                  the war might stand and go home
                  again...

13   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY, 1918                                13

     And we see just that... bullets leaving mens' wounds
     sailing back into the rifles from whence they came...
     limbs, whole again... cannon balls rocketing backwards
     into the cannons' breech... Fallen come to their feet, to
     live and breathe again.

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.)
                  ... home to farm, to work, have
                  children, to live long, full
                  lives...

14   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         14

     Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat...

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  Perhaps, my own son might come
                  home again...

15   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, ANOTHER TIME     15

     And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life
     hopping backward off the train to land where his journey
     started... back in the arms of his loving parents...

                                                                  7.



16   INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                  16

                             MONSIEUR GATEAU
               I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I
               hope you enjoy my clock.

     And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the
     terminal and exits... The crowd is motionless. They look
     to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance... but he simply puts his
     hat on, and with his guardians, is gone...

                             DAISY'S (V.O.)
               Mr Cake was never seen again.
               Some say he died of a broken
               heart. Some say he went to sea...

17   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - AT THE END OF A DAY             17

     Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing... away...

18   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT           18

                             DAISY
               He just rowed...rowed...away...

     The wind loudly rattles the window...they turn to look...

                              DOROTHY BAKER
               Do you mind if I make myself a
               call? I've got somebody watching
               my little boy.

                             CAROLINE
               No, please go call...

     It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying
     mother... with the wind knocking at the window... After
     some moments:

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               I hope I haven't disappointed you,
               Mother.

                              DAISY
               Oh honey, you could never
               disappoint me.

                             CAROLINE
               I wished I had more to show for
               myself. I know you would have
               liked to have had grandchildren.

                  My life hasn't been all that...
                  normal...

     As if to say the pieces haven't all fit... trying to
     articulate it...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  I'm either a step ahead... or a

                  What's normal?     A hat full of
                  sand.

                                   CAROLINE
                  What?

                                DAISY
                       (going on)
                  I need my brown suitcase... The

                                   CAROLINE
                  An envelope?

     Caroline doing what she's asked goes over to one of the
     suitcases by the bed... She opens it... and among the
     clothes and the keepsakes, there is indeed an old
     envelope.

                                   CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  This one?

                  I tried to read it a hundred

                                   DAISY
                  Read it to me.

     Daisy closes her eyes... Caroline takes out a sheath of
     papers... It's a journal of some kind written in
     longhand... Pages have come undone... scraps of paper,
     even some napkins...

     And for her mother's sake she begins to read it... with
     no particular interest, like reading to someone a
     selection from a menu's choices...

                             CAROLINE
               It's dated "April 4, 1985." It
               says, "New Orleans."
                    (after a beat)
               "This is my last will and
               testament...
                    (which starts to
                     engage her)
               I don't have much to leave... few
               possessions, no money really... I
               will go out of this world the same
               way I came in, alone and with
               nothing.

               writing it now while I still
               remember it..."

     She's interested. She looks over at her mother.    But her
     mother's eyes are closed...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "My name is Benjamin..."

     And Caroline's voice becomes a young MAN'S voice...

                             A MAN'S (V.O.)
               "Benjamin Button... and I was born

19   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                                19

     THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               The war to end all wars had ended.

     We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with
     drunken, singing revelers... cars jamming the
     cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful... Another
     burst of fireworks.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I was told it was an especially

     And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his
     early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a
     fashionable town home. He nearly collides with a PRIEST
     who arrives there at the same time. Thomas runs past
     him, up the steps...

20   INT. BUTTON HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                20

     ...He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase...
     barging into the MASTER BEDROOM...

                                                                    10.



21   INT. MASTER BEDROOM, BUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 1918                 21

     ... where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed,
     frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the
     help of the small domestic staff... the PRIEST enters...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
                    (seeing him)
               Why are you here?

                             THE DOCTOR
               Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going
               to survive...

     And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty
     young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets,
     futilely start to change her bloody linens...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
               That's enough...! All of you!

     They move out of the way... and Thomas kneels beside his
     wife... She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes...
     He takes her hand...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               I came as quickly as I could...
               I'm sorry I took so long, the
               streets are filled with people...

     As if to underscore it, fireworks go off...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               You are going to be alright, my
               dearest darling... I will not let
               anything happen to you...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE
               Promise me, Thomas...

     And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY.    But
     Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONT'D)
               Promise me, he has a place...

     He doesn't understand... She looks up at him... holds his
     hand tight... then she slips away... The Doctor listening
     for her pulse... He covers her... it's quiet... the
     Priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids
     crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 11.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  She gave her life for me... And
                  for that I am forever grateful...

     Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go...
     When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is
     not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor,
     or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a
     deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all
     turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY
     continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to
     answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick
     blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to
     lift it, to see his son's face...

                                   MAID
                  Mr. Button...!

     He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has
     seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of
     sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh." And then he suddenly
     snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of
     the room... downstairs... outside...

22   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                              22

     ... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY,
     through the streets... Pushing through crowds...

23   EXT. A BRIDGE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                    23

     ... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the
     air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark...
     brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the
     black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when,
     despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it...
     Instead, cradles the newborn...

                                THOMAS
                  I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

     A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way...

                                POLICEMAN
                  What are you doing there!?

     The BABY starts to CRY...

                                POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                  What do you have there?

     Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas,
     carrying the CRYING BABY, running...

                                                                  12.



23A   EXT. NEW ORLEANS, GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1918             23A

      Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow
      streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the
      large old moldering antebellum houses...

24    EXT. THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918     24

      He comes to an old three-story house with a screened
      porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and
      LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light,
      by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops
      its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath...
      He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of
      VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
      porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has,
      tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can
      just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
      Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his
      decision made, he turns, moving away from the house,
      leaving his child behind.

                              A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                I could've sworn I heard somebody
                knockin'...

      When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto
      the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s,
      with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as
      QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR.
      WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the
      door, and not seeing anything...

                                 QUEENIE
                I guess not...

      She stands for a moment taking in the night air...

                              QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                The air smells sweet...

      And she sings to herself... a song from the time...

                              TIZZY
                You look very handsome tonight,
                Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever
                seen you... The green matches
                your eyes...

                              QUEENIE
                     (fingering dress)
                It isn't everyday a war's over,
                Mr. Weathers...
                              (MORE)
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                     13.

24   CONTINUED:                                                      24
                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have to mark it somehow... You
                  ain't no slouch yourself.

     He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert's back in town... came
                  home legless, but he home... we're
                  gonna throw a party for him...
                  help get himself situated...
                       (beat)
                  I know you was sweet on him one
                  time...

                                QUEENIE
                  Sweeter than I shoulda been...
                  Lost his legs you say? "You never
                  know what's comin' for you."

     And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head
     out...

                                OLD WOMAN
                  Ms. Simone messed herself...

                                QUEENIE
                  She got to stop doing that, or
                  it's diapers for her... I'll be
                  right there, Mrs. Jameson...

     The woman disappears inside.    Queenie, not anxious to
     go...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  It sure is nice out here, Mr.
                  Weathers...

                                TIZZY
                  Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come
                  out back for a moment... take your
                  mind away from things...

     He pushes open the porch screen door...

                                QUEENIE
                       (smiles)
                  Just a moment's time...

     He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of
     the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right
     on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles,
     nearly falls...


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 14.

24   CONTINUED: (2)                                              24

                             TIZZY
               What in God's name...?!!

                                QUEENIE
               What is that?     A fish crawl out of
               the river...?

     She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               God in heaven!

     IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we
     see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it
     has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an
     octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it
     would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed
     old man...

                             QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               My Goodness, the Lord did
               something here...!

                             TIZZY
               Look like a milk wagon run over
               it... three times... and back...

     And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I didn't see it layin' there... I
               hope I didn't hurt it none...
               steppin' on it like that...

     The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               We best leave it to the police...
               I'll go --

     Queenie hesitates... a longing.

                             QUEENIE
               It's for sure nobody wanted to
               keep it...

     And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying
     baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering
     something, going in after her...

                                                                  15.



25   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918              25

     A piano's playing a standard, people singing.... There's
     a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and
     carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of
     those who have lived and died here over many years... and
     we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to
     ninety-five, in various stages of health... various
     contraptions to keep them "afloat". An Old Age Home. We
     see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the
     crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her,
     still anxiously whispering after her...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Where are you, Queenie...?

                             QUEENIE
               Hold your water...
                    (and to Tizzy)
               Go see to them.

     He does what she asks. She hurries the baby into a small
     room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...

26   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM, OLD HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918     26

     A small room tucked under the staircase...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Queenie Apple... she went and
               messed herself all over again...

                             QUEENIE
               Jane Childress start her a bath...
               and mind your business, Mrs.
               Duprey... You'll be messing
               yourself soon enough too!

     There's a KNOCK on Queenie's door.

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                    (whispers)
               Somebody stole my necklace...

                             QUEENIE
               I'll be right with you, Mrs.
               Hollister...

     She whispers to The Baby, soothing it. And looking for a
     place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                16.

26   CONTINUED:                                                 26

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  You may be as ugly as an old
                  pot... but you still a child of
                  God...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Queenie, Apple... she won't go
                  take a bath wit'out you...

                                QUEENIE
                  Mercy, I'll be right there.

     And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser
     drawer... with her unmentionables... and shuts it...
     leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe...
     Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost,
     looking in the room...

                                MRS. HOLLISTER
                  My sister gave those pearls to
                  me... I can't find them
                  anywhere... People are stealing my
                  jewelry...!

                                 QUEENIE
                  They're right here, Mrs.
                  Hollister, right 'round your
                  pretty white neck...
                       (moving her)
                  Come on now...

     There's a sound of a door chime...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Dr. Rose has arrived for his
                  visit...

     Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby, and
     closes the door... And we stay behind for a moment...
     inside Queenie's underwear drawer, with the smell of a
     lilac sachet... is the Baby with the face of an old
     man... looking up at the sliver of light coming into the
     dresser drawer...

27   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918        27

     We see the Doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has
     done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing
     examining one of the elderly boarders. He puts his
     things into his doctor's bag. Queenie comes beside him,
     saying something...

                                                                  17.



28   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT, 1918                       28

     The Baby is lying on Queenie's bed... Dr. Rose,
     stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink.

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               ... He's nearly blind from
               cataracts... I'm not sure he can
               hear... His bones indicate severe
               arthritis... His skin has lost all
               elasticity... His hands and feet
               are ossified... He has all the
               deterioration, the infirmities,
               not of a newborn, but of a man
               well in his eighties on the way to
               his grave...

                             QUEENIE
               You mean to say he's dying?

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               Of old age. His body is failing
               him before his life's begun.

     They're still, looking at the strange baby.

                             DOCTOR ROSE (CONT'D)
               Where did he come from?

                             QUEENIE
                    (after a beat)
               It's my sister's child... From
               Lafayette. She had an unfortunate
               adventure.
                    (whispers)
               The poor child got the worse of
               it... came out white...

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               There are places for 'unwanted'
               babies like these, Queenie...
               There's no room for another mouth
               to feed here... The Nolan
               Foundation, despite their good
               intentions, thinks this place is a
               large nuisance as it is... A baby
               here --

                             QUEENIE
                    (appealing)
               You said he don't have long.

                                DOCTOR ROSE
                  Queenie -- some creatures aren't
                  meant to survive.

     She looks at the Baby, determined.

                                QUEENIE
                  He is a miracle, that's for
                  certain... just not the kind of
                  miracle one hopes to see...

29   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1918                     29

     The Old People are sitting around the parlor talking,
     playing cards... Queenie brings the baby bundle into the
     room.

                                QUEENIE
                  You all listen...

     And they stop what they are doing...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have a visitor that will be
                  staying with us for a little
                  while... My sister had a child but
                  couldn't see right by it... He's
                  known as...
                       (a hesitation naming him)
                  Benjamin...
                       (she likes the sound
                        of it)
                  Benjamin... He's not a well
                  child... so we need to take very
                  good care of him...

     We see Tizzy's come out of the kitchen , watching with an
     air of strong disapproval... And an OLD WOMAN says...

                                ONE OF THE WOMEN
                  I had ten children... there's not
                  a baby I can't care for... let me
                  see him...

     Queenie hesitates, and gives the Baby to her... The Old
     Woman pushes the blanket back from the baby's face...

                                THE OLD WOMAN
                       (startled)
                  God in heaven, he looks just like
                  my ex-husband...

     And there's laughter...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 19.

29   CONTINUED:                                                  29

                                QUEENIE
                  He's prematurely old... Doctor
                  Rose said he don't have much time
                  on this earth...

                                   A MAN
                  Join the club.

     They all laugh. Their laughter makes the baby seem to
     smile... the lonely smile of an old, dying man.

30   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT, 1918          30

     We see Queenie, unable to sleep, lying in bed, looking
     out a small window... there's a light KNOCK on the
     door... Tizzy...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert sends his remembrance to
                  you.

     She nods... The baby cries out... and then it's quiet...

                                TIZZY (CONT'D)
                       (meaning the baby)
                  Are you right out of your mind? I
                  know you don't got all the parts
                  it takes to make one of your
                  own... but this isn't yours to
                  keep... this isn't even human
                  kind...

     With nothing left to be said, he starts to go...

                                QUEENIE
                       (whispers)
                  Mr. Weathers. Stay with me
                  tonight.

     He slows.    She's quiet.     And she whispers:

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  "You never know what's comin' for
                  you."

     And as they move to be with one another, to make love; we
     look over at the dresser drawer -- open just a crack...
     Benjamin lying among the unmentionables, looking out at
     the world...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I found a home...

                                                                  20.



31   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           31

     Caroline with the "journal" on her knees. Daisy, eyes
     closed... the wind gathered in strength... furiously
     knocking...

                             CAROLINE
               Is any of this true?

                             DAISY
               You have such a lovely voice.

     Caroline shrugs.   She looks through the "book..."

                             CAROLINE
               Some pages seem to be torn out
               here...

     She discovers inside...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               There's an old streetcar token.

     She gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it.
     But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window...

                             DAISY
               That clock... Just kept going,
               year after year after year...

32   INT. "NEW" TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1925    32

     And we see "Mr. Cake's" clock with its cherubs pushing
     the "hands of progress," still marking time backwards...
     The year is now, "1925..."

33   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM, NEW ORLEANS -            33
     EVENING, 1925

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               "...I didn't know I was a child.
               I thought I was like everyone else
               who lived there, an old man, in my
               "golden years."

     The boarders eating dinner. Queenie, in a white
     uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and
     apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient
     faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing
     eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come
     to know... the face of a very old man...



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                 21.

33   CONTINUED:                                                  33

     The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a
     six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small,
     shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with
     arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a
     hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one
     ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are
     sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the
     last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we
     watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might,
     banging it just for the hell of it making noise...

                                QUEENIE
                  Stop bangin' that fork...
                       (fixing it in his
                        arthritic hand)
                  It's for eating, not for playin'
                  with... And use your napkin,
                  please Mr. Benjamin...

     And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of
     the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man
     having dinner with his contemporaries.

34   EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925      34

     A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six-
     year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between
     them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough,
     sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making
     him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the
     other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking...
     Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children
     playing... people talking...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON
                  What's there?

     Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally
     curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself
     precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall
     is lower and he just sees the street... children running
     on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off
     for a party... He leans forward to get an even better
     view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...

                                QUEENIE
                  Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come
                  back here...!

     ...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the
     safety of the old people... out of sight of the street...

                                                                  22.



35   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925                            35

     The small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in
     a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I loved her very much. She was my
               mother.

     And he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes
     his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie
     in bed, her "son", the "old man" on the floor...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               Somedays I feel like I'm different
               from the day before...

                             QUEENIE
               Everybody feels different about
               themselves one way or another.
               We're all goin' the same way, just
               taking different roads to get
               there... You're on your own road,
               Benjamin.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               How much longer do I have to live,
               Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               Just be thankful you got what
               you're given. You already here
               longer than you supposed to be.

     We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Some nights, I would have to sleep
               alone.

     He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying
     him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy
     going back down into the room to be with Queenie...
     shutting the door...

36   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925            36

     An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a
     book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his
     wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house.

36   CONTINUED:                                                        36

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I didn't mind. I would listen to
                  the house breathing. All the
                  people sleeping. I felt safe.

     Be he still wants to know "What's over there?" He wheels
     himself over to sit at the window looking outside...
     looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate...
     trying to see what's dangerous...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  It was a place of great routine...
                  Every morning at 5:30, no matter
                  the weather... General Winslow,
                  U.S. Army Retired... raised the
                  flag...

37   EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                  37

     And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just
     that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's
     naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with
     a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING
     OPERA...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                  Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted
                  opera singer... well, she'd sing,
                  Wagner...

38   INT. MRS. WAGNER'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925              38

     We see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown
     at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the
     top of her lungs... while, down the hall we see Queenie
     giving Benjamin a bath... massaging his poor crippled
     legs...

                                 QUEENIE
                  We're gonna put some life into
                  these old sticks for you... get
                  you walkin'...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  Breakfast was served promptly at
                  six.

39   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                     39

     We see Benjamin in his wheelchair, under Tizzy's
     tutelage, learning to cook... and simultaneously, to
     read...

                  How we doin'?    What's that say
                  there?

                                  BENJAMIN

                               TIZZY
                  Think. That's a 'v' not a 'b.'
                  Say it.

                                  BENJAMIN
                  Gravy.

                  Now you talkin'!

     Some staff come in getting platters of food...

                                TIZZY (CONT'D)
                  How many parts butter we got?

                                  BENJAMIN
                  Four...

                                TIZZY
                  How many parts flour?

                                  BENJAMIN
                  Two...

                                TIZZY
                  How much is four and two?

                                  BENJAMIN
                  Six.

     Tizzy smacks the back of his head.

                                TIZZY
                  You're a regular addin' machine...

                  Dinner was served promptly at six.

                                                                  25.



40   INT. KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1925                      40

     Tizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him...
     putting away cans... reading from one of the labels...

                             BENJAMIN
               Tomato, brown sugar, salt,
               myasses...

     Tizzy swats at him with his dish towel...

                               TIZZY
               "Molasses"...

     And while washing the dishes...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I learned to read when I was five.
               My grandfather was a dresser for a
               famous actor. He'd bring home
               every play for me to read.
                    (Shakespeare)
               "Kind keepers of my weak decaying
               age, Let dying Mortimer here rest
               himself. Even like a man new
               haled from the rack. So fare my
               limbs with long imprisonment. And
               these gray locks, the pursuivants
               of death, Nestor-like aged in an
               age of care, Argue the end of
               Edmund Mortimer."

     Benjamin's mouth agape, awed, taken by him, his majesty.

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               You thought I was plain ignorant,
               didn't you?

     Benjamin never thought about it...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               The actor my grandfather worked
               for was John Wilkes Booth. He
               killed Abraham Lincoln. You never
               know...

     An old man looks in...

                             A MAN
               When's dessert...?

                  When it's served. Now sit your
                  wrinkly butt back down, Mr. Lee.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  On Saturday nights I would go to
                  Queenie's church...

41   INT. CHURCH TENT, NEW ORLEANS - A SATURDAY NIGHT, 1926           41

     A sweltering shout 'em up Negro gospel tent. Queenie
     pushes Benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people
     looking to be healed, bringing him face to face with a
     mountain of a PREACHER, pouring sweat and full of fire...

                                THE PREACHER
                  What can I do for you, Sister?

     And Queenie whispers something to him.

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Her parts are all twisted up
                  inside so she can't have little
                  children...

     He puts his hand on her stomach...

                                PREACHER
                  Lord, if you could see clear to
                  forgive this woman her sins so she
                  can bear the fruit of the womb.
                       (and shouts)
                  Out damnable affliction!

     He presses on her stomach... making Queenie nearly fall
     over... held up by a "NURSE" in a crisp white uniform.
     And once she's regained her balance...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (at Benjamin)
                  And what's this old man's
                  irrediction?

                                QUEENIE
                  He's got the devil on his back...
                  trying to ride him into the grave
                  before his time...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (touches Benjamin)
                  Out, Zebuchar! Out, Beelzebub!
                       (after a beat)
                  How old are you?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      27.

41   CONTINUED:                                                       41

     And he says what is only true.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm seven, but I look a lot older.

                                   PREACHER
                       (laughs)
                  God bless you.    He's seven!

     The congregation laughs...

                                THE PREACHER
                  This is a man who has optimism in
                  his heart! Belief in his soul!
                  We are all children in the eyes of
                  God. Now we are going to get you
                  out of that chair... we're gonna
                  have you walk...
                       (his hands on Ben's
                        shoulders)
                  In the name of God's glory, rise
                  up!

     And Benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his
     legs akimbo, stands... The people all applaud...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Now God is going to see you the
                  rest of the way... He's going to
                  see this little old man walk
                  without the use of a crutch or a
                  cane...! He's going walk by
                  himself on faith and divine
                  inspiration alone...! We'll show
                  that Devil where to go...! Walk
                  on...!

     And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor
     arthritic legs give out... and he sprawls to the floor...
     The Aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but:

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch him!
                       (kneeling to Benjamin)
                  Rise up, old man!

     But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor... The Preacher
     comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Rise up like Lazarus!

     Benjamin still lies on the floor...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                   28.

41   CONTINUED: (2)                                                41

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               I said rise up!!

     And Benjamin, slowly but surely, makes his way to his
     feet...

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               Yes, and say hallelujah!
                    (Hallelujah!)
               Now walk, my old friend...
               Walk on...!

     And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across
     the stage... The people urging him on... a string of
     "Hallelujahs...!" Queenie comes to join him... urging
     him...

                             QUEENIE
               Let the Lord carry you... ...

     ...The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance
     than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord... Queenie and
     The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage...
     Benjamin making it to the other end... to a roar of
     "Amens"!

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Now, when I look back on it, it
               was kind of miraculous... But you
               know the saying, "...the Lord
               Giveth and the Lord Taketh
               away..."

     ... That mountain of a Preacher... in full exaltation to
     God...

                             THE PREACHER
               Praise be to the Lord on the
               highest...!

     Suddenly pitches over, flat on his face... Having had a
     spontaneous coronary... lying center-stage, deader than
     the proverbial doornail... The crisp uniformed "nurses"
     running to attend to him, and poor "old" Benjamin
     haplessly looking around.

42   INT. THE PARLOR ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY 1926          42

     The people are gathered...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               There were birthdays...

       A lit cake is being brought in celebrating General
       Winslow's birthday. He stares at the cake, unhappily
       gets up, mutters something... and leaves. The oldsters
       eye the cake, and without a moment's hesitation, dig
       in...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                    And mortality was a common visitor
                    to our house... People came and
                    went... Death was so frequent, I
                    was never afraid of it.

43     EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, ANOTHER MORNING, 1926                        43

       Mrs. Wagner's window open... and not a sound coming
       out...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                    You could hear when someone left
                    us... there was a silence in the
                    house...

44     EXT. AN OLD NEW ORLEANS' CEMETERY - DAY, 1926                  44

       A small funeral at   an old cemetery... And while "DIE
       VALKYRIE" PLAYS on   her crank VICTROLA, an old man bangs
       cymbals as a grand   finale to the music... while we see
       SYBIL WAGNER, laid   to rest to sing in another choir:

45     EXT. THE FRONT PORCH, THE NOLAN HOUSE - DUSK, 1926             45

       Benjamin with his wondrous ancient face sitting in his
       wheelchair with the old people on the porch... watching
       the sun go down...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                    It was a wonderful place to grow
                    up. I was with people who had put
                    away all the inconsequences of
                    life, left in a state of purely
                    being...wondering about the
                    weather...the temperature of a
                    bath...the light at the end of the
                    day...

       And one of them, as if to underscore the point, farts...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                For everyone that died, someone
                would come to take their place...

      And we see Benjamin coming into the kitchen... Tizzy busy
      preparing lunch... Benjamin stops, seeing a tiny African
      man, his back to us, surrounded by old people standing on
      the lawn... He hears him telling them...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                ... My first wife and I are
                captured by neighbor tribe,
                cannibals...

      The old people shrink at the mention...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I escaped across the river...

                              AN OLD WOMAN
                     (wide eyed)
                You escaped cannibals?

                              NGUNDA OTI
                My wife, she can't swim, so she
                eaten.

                              TIZZY
                     (telling Benjamin)
                That's Mr. Oti... He's an
                acquaintance of an acquaintance of
                mine...he'll be stayin' with us in
                the staff quarters for awhile...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                     (telling old people)
                ...Second wife stepped on viper
                and dies... (jocular) It was bad
                luck to be married to Mr. Oti.

      They laugh.

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I am captured with six others by
                Baschiele tribe. They sell us to a
                big white man...

      He instinctively turns and sees Benjamin standing in the
      window watching him. When Mr. Oti spots him he quickly
      moves out of the window out of sight.

                                                                   31.



47C   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME, 1927            47C

      We see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing
      with some metal army men... when Mr. Oti's distinctive
      laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs...
      Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... Mr. Oti,
      standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the
      help, telling them his life story... but it's a
      completely different tone... a mockery of white people
      and their insanity...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                The Big White Man brings us to St.
                Louis, where they make our village
                at the 1904 World's Fair... They
                have us livin' in these little
                huts like we're livin' in
                Africa... people behind bars
                staring at us... we told not to
                look at them... to just go about
                our normal lives... what the hell
                they talkin' about... ?

      They all laugh...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                At night we're done bein'
                "savages..." we go over the wall
                into The Rosebud... we drank and
                laughed until the sun come up...
                and then we savages again...

      They nod enjoying the idea... And as Mr. Oti senses
      Benjamin's presence, turning... Benjamin retreating on
      his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs...

47D   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1927            47D

      Benjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an
      oversized book of "Imaginary Beings..." He senses a
      presence... and Mr. Oti sits down across from him.

                              NGUNDA OTI
                I hear you not so old as you
                looking. You just foolin'
                everybody. What happen, you get
                Madjembe?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's a madjembe?

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Worms.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't think so. This is just
                   how I am.

      Mr. Oti looks out at the street.

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   You want to get a cold root beer?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (an echo)
                   It's dangerous.

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Who said that?

      He gets up ready to go. Benjamin hesitates. He can see
      Queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a
      rug.

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                        (last chance)
                   ...Come on little man...

      Despite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes
      and follows Ngunda outside...

49    EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927       49

      They come outside. Children on the street playing.
      Seeing Benjamin, they come to a dead stop... staring at
      the freak from the old people's home, with another
      freak... Mr. Oti suddenly runs into the street...

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Hurry...

      Benjamin tries as best he can to keep up... Mr. Oti darts
      directly in front of a street car, waving his arms,
      making it come to an abrupt stop...

50    INT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927                 50

      We move along the aisle of a streetcar... the various
      people...

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   Then I am in the monkey house at
                   "Philadelphia Zoological Park."
                   Three thousand people show up my
                   first day...

      Benjamin and Ngunda siting in the back of the streetcar
      behind a moveable metal bar that has "Coloreds" painted
      on it... Mr. Oti taking a slug from a flask... A group of
      school children nearby can't take their eyes off the two
      of them... Mr. Oti takes his wallet out, taking out a
      folded piece of newspaper, showing it to Benjamin...
      "Bushman shares cage with park apes."

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's it like living in a cage?

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   It stinks. The monkeys, they do
                   some tricks... I throw spear... I
                   wrestle with Kowali, she is
                   orangutan... They have me file my
                   teeth like a cannibal...

      He shows him his teeth filed into points like a
      cannibal...

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                   When I'm not playing with monkeys -
                   - they want me to run to bars in
                   my cage with teeth to scare little
                   children...

      And he suddenly jumps up and does just that, charging
      with his teeth bared at the school children... They
      scream... Mr. Oti, taking his seat again, laughs with
      Benjamin...

50A   INT. (OR) EXT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY             50A

      Benjamin, ecstatic, his head out the streetcar window,
      Mr. Oti holding onto the back of his breeches from
      falling... Benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash
      over him...

                                                                 34.



51   EXT. THE PERISTYLE, NEW ORLEANS - PARK - END OF DAY, 1927   51

     Benjamin and Mr. Oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle
     of a park. Benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola,
     taking too big a hit, the coke pouring out of his nose...
     Mr. Oti gives him a handkerchief... after he's wiped
     himself up...

                             BENJAMIN
               Why didn't you go back home?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               War between English and Dutch
               people had broken up kingdom.

                             BENJAMIN
               What did you do?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I leave zoo. Go here. Go there.
               Everything okay. But I alone.

                             BENJAMIN
               You were all alone?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               You'll see little man, plenty
               times you be alone. You different
               like us, it's gonna be that way.
               But I tell you a little secret I
               find out. We know we alone. Fat
               people, skinny people, tall
               people, white people... they just
               as alone as us... But they scared
               shitless...

     He smiles a knowing smile...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               Not a thing wrong with being
               alone... no sir...

     He looks out...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               I think about the river I grew up
               on. It would be good to sit by my
               river again.

     He looks at his watch.   He suddenly gets up...

                                                                 34A.



52   EXT. BOURBON STREET CORNER, NEW ORLEANS - DUSK, 1927         52

     Mr. Oti and Benjamin coming along the street, music
     pouring out... They reach a corner where a tall octoroon
     woman is waiting. She broadly smiles seeing Mr. Oti.

                             THE WOMAN
               There's my little man. You ready,
               sugar.

                  Always ready. Always ready.
                       (introduces)
                  Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

                                FILAMENA GILEA
                       (respectful of his
                        age)
                  It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                       (to Benjamin)
                  You can find your own way home,
                  can't you?

     Although he's not sure he can... he nods, yes.

                                NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                  The St. Charles Avenue line to
                  Napoleon...

     And with that, his arm around Filamena's waist, the two
     of them laughing, walk off... Benjamin's left standing on
     the street corner... he looks around to get his
     bearings... he moves along Bourbon Street... A streetcar
     comes along, bell clanging, it rushes by him... he
     watches it go... Clasping his canes, determined, he
     starts walking... bent over, one cane after the other...
     making his way along the street...

53   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1927                53

     We see Benjamin coming back to the gate... and we hear:

                                QUEENIE (V.O.)
                  Where in God's name have you
                  been?!!

     And we see Queenie standing on the porch... She's worried
     sick... she sees his hands are bleeding from blisters.

54   INT. KITCHEN, QUEENIE'S SINK, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT               54

     Queenie cleaning his hands...

                                QUEENIE
                  Like to scare the Holy Hell out of
                  me! I was so worried about
                  you...you take my breath away...

                  life.

55   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              55

     And the "caregiver," Dorothy Baker, comes back in.        She
     feels Daisy's pulse, straightens her pillow...

                                DOROTHY BAKER
                  How's her breathing... ?

                                CAROLINE

     Dorothy nods.

                       (after a beat)
                  They're sayin' it's gonna reach us
                  late in the day... I'm goin' to
                  get my baby and take him to my
                  sister's... they said there's
                  nothin' to worry about here in the
                  hospital...Nurses are right here
                  if you need them...I'll see you in
                  about an hour if that'll be

                  No, that's fine...please...

     She leaves. It's momentarily quiet, the wind knocking at
     the window... Daisy, ruminating...

                                DAISY
                  Was there just company?

                                CAROLINE
                  Dorothy had to go home...

     But Daisy's mind is elsewhere...gesturing for her to keep
     reading...

                                DAISY
                  Caroline...

     Caroline looks back at the book.       Daisy closes her

     The boarders on the lawn with their loved ones... And we          *
     see an OLD MAN, walking with the aid of a cane coming out         *
     of the house onto the lawn... And as he moves through the         *
     people we see it's Benjamin... He has a single cane,              *
     standing more upright now, a distinctive shock of white
     hair, eyebrows... A distinguished looking man in his              *
     seventies, or, in normal years, a growing twelve-year-old
     boy...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met
               the person who changed my life
               forever.

     A chauffeured car has stopped... A Man is standing in the
     road, looking at the house through the gates... And we
     realize it's THOMAS BUTTON... looking for a glimpse of
     his son... Benjamin instinctively turns, but it's too
     late, his father's back in the car, being driven away...

57   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THANKSGIVING, 1930           57

     The families, along with Ngunda and Filamena, are
     gathered in the dining room, their heads bowed in prayer.
     We see Daisy across from Benjamin... The prayer's
     finished, it's noisy...

                             NGUNDA OTI
               We pray to Bembe... the creator of
               all living things... she retired
               after all that work...

                             DAISY
                    (needing to top that)
               Did you know turkeys aren't really
               birds...?

                             BENJAMIN
               Why do you say that?

                             DAISY
               They're in the pheasant family.
               They can hardly fly. It's sad
               don't you think? A bird, that
               can't fly.

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I like birds that can't fly.
               They're easy to eat.

                             QUEENIE

     They're quiet.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  While we're giving thanks for
                  God's blessings... I've had a
                  miracle happen.
                       (she touches her
                        stomach)
                  The Lord saw fit to answer my
                  prayers.

     The people applaud the good news.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What does she mean "answered her
                  prayers?"

                                DAISY
                  She's going to have a baby, silly.
                  That's what my mother said when I
                  was going to have a little
                  brother. He didn't live long
                  though. He didn't breathe
                  right...

     And we can see Benjamin's heart beginning to break... he
     looks over, Tizzy, proudly smiling... And as Queenie
     accepts congratulations... Benjamin's old wrinkled face,
     watching her... looks like he's going to cry...

58   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1930                    58

     We see an ABSTRACT BLACK AND WHITE DRAWING.       And we hear
     a woman's voice...

     AN OLD FINGER comes in pointing to a drawing. We see                  *
     Benjamin and Daisy, sitting close together on a sofa, and             *

59   INT. A ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT, 1930                 59

     We see Benjamin asleep in bed with one of the Old Men,
     MR. DAWS. The door opens. And Daisy, in her nightgown,
     has come inside... she slightly touches Benjamin...

                             DAISY
                    (whispers)
               Are you sleeping?

     He shakes "no."

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
                    (whispers)
               Come on...

     She moves quickly out of the room and Benjamin gets up,
     and with the aid of his cane, follows her...

60   INT. BACK STAIRWELL, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930            60

     The old house still. Daisy, moving quietly down the
     stairs. Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps,
     following her.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (whispers)
               Where are we going?

     She doesn't say anything. She leads him into the DINING
     ROOM... where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and
     pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and
     a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry...

                               DAISY
               Under here...

     And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table...
     Benjamin follows her into the "fort..."

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
               Nobody knows about this but us.

     They sit... The little girl, and the old man with the
     maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret
     lair... She takes a candle out of the folds of her
     nightgown... She tries to light it, but doesn't really
     know how to use matches...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Will you light it?

                                DAISY
                  Don't be chicken...

     Despite his caution, he lights the candle... the
     candlelight making it feel more secret...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                  I'll tell you a secret then you
                  tell me one...
                       (whispers)
                  I saw mommy kissing another man.
                  Her face was red from it.

     Benjamin doesn't know what to say.

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Your turn to tell.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm younger than I look.

                                DAISY
                       (whispers)
                  You don't seem like an old
                  person... like my grandma... Are
                  you sick?

                                BENJAMIN
                       (whispers)
                  I heard Tizzy and my mother
                  whisper. They said I was going to
                  die soon.
                       (smiles)
                  But I fooled them so far.

     Daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight.

                                DAISY
                  You are different than anybody I
                  have ever met. Can I?

     She innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to
     see what it feels like... When suddenly a sheet is pulled
     back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there.

                             GRANDMA FULLER
               What are you doing under there?
               Who's idea was this candle?

     She angrily blows it out... and... to Daisy... taking her
     by the arm...

                             GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D)
               It's after midnight, you come
               right out here and get back up to
               bed...!
                    (and for Benjamin,
                     but saying it to
                     Daisy)
               You are not to be playing
               together! Play with people your
               own age...!
                    (moving her along)
               Now, you come back to bed, young
               lady...! You're too young to be
               wandering around in the night by
               yourself...
                    (and a last word to
                     Benjamin)
               You should be ashamed of yourself!

     And they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the
     sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in
     her nightgown, standing in the doorway...

                             QUEENIE
               You are a different child... a man
               child. People aren't going to
               understand how different you are.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (forlorn)
               What's wrong with me, Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               God hasn't said yet. Now, back to
               bed and behave yourself.

     He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane,
     and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the
     back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask.
     He looks at Benjamin as he goes by.

     Benjamin climbing back into bed with the Old Man.

               Did I ever tell you I've been
               struck by lightning seven times.
               Once, when I was fixing a leak on
               the roof.

     And we see just that, the old man on a roof getting
     blasted.

                             MR. DAWS (CONT'D)
               Once, when I was crossing the road
               to get the mail...

     And we see that, the man peacefully crossing a country
     road to get the mail, getting hit by lightning... But
     Benjamin just lays there looking out the window... all he
     can think about... despite everything...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I never forgot her blue eyes...

62   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           62

     The words linger. Daisy, her extraordinary blue eyes,
     lying on her death bed... the rattle of the window in the
     wind...

                             CAROLINE
               Are you alright, Mother?

     She nods "yes."

                                                                     45.

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  This man. He loved you from the
                  first time he saw you.

     She doesn't say anything.

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                       (without complaint)
                  Nobody has ever loved me that way.

                                DAISY
                       (impelling her)
                  Go on.

                                CAROLINE
                  He crossed out something... and
                  then he's written... "When..."

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  "...When the baby came things were
                  different..."

63   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                     63

     We see Benjamin in his pajamas, quietly coming into the
     kitchen for something to eat... And he slows, seeing
     Queenie, taking a moment to herself, sitting at the
     kitchen table, peacefully breast-feeding her infant... as
     Benjamin slips back out unseen, closing the door after
     him...

64   INT. ATTIC, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                           64

     We see Benjamin lying on a small bed in the ATTIC...
     cluttered with years of accumulated things...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I moved into my own room in the
                  attic... I realized, despite a
                  house filled with people that I
                  loved, I was alone...

     There's a noise. And we see Ngunda Oti is at the door, a
     suitcase in hand.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I come to say goodbye. I'm going
                  away.

                                 BENJAMIN
                  Going away?   Where?



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       46.

64   CONTINUED:                                                        64

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I don't figure that out yet. I
                  will send you a postcard when I
                  get to there.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What about your friend?   The tall
                  lady?

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  We're not friends anymore. That's
                  what happens with tall people.

     He starts to go...

                                BENJAMIN
                  Goodbye...

     And he's gone.   Benjamin gets up going to the window.
     He looks outside. He can see Mr. Oti come onto the
     porch. There's a full moon. And as he walks off, his
     arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the
     gate, Benjamin watches him disappear into the night.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I spent a lot of time by myself
                  that year...

65   INT. FRONT ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1931                  65

     Benjamin sitting at a table, an old man to look at but no
     more than twelve, busy playing with magnets...

                                BENJAMIN (V.O)
                  Until...

     We see a refined, genteel OLD WOMAN, wearing a hat and
     gloves, a suitcase at her feet, flanked by an old DOG,
     just inside the front door...

                                BENJAMIN               (CONT'D)
                  Hello...

                                THE WOMAN
                  I'm moving in today.

     And just then Queenie appears, the baby on her hip...

                                QUEENIE
                  Welcome... we was expecting you...
                       (to Benjamin)
                  Could you show her upstairs?
                                (MORE)

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                              47.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  She will be staying in Mrs.
                  Rousseau's old room. I'll be
                  right with you with some fresh
                  towels...
                       (frowning)
                  We don't usually let dogs in the
                  house.

                                THE WOMAN
                  He's as old as the hills. Blind
                  too. Can hardly get around, he
                  won't be a bother much longer.

     Benjamin, like any young boy, immediately pets the old
     dog...

                                QUEENIE
                  I guess as long as he stays out
                  from underfoot.

     Benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the
     stairs...the old dog dutifully following them...

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm Benjamin...

     The woman starts to tell him her name... but we don't
     hear it because...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                       (after a beat)
                  As hard as I try, I can't remember
                  her name. Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs.
                  Hartford, or maybe it was Maple?
                  It's funny how sometimes the
                  people we remember the least, make
                  the greatest impression on us.

66   INT. THE OLDER WOMAN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1931     66

     Benjamin sits petting the dog while the Woman puts her
     things away...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I remember she wore diamonds...
                  and she always dressed in fine
                  clothing as if she was going out.
                  Although, she never did and nobody
                  would ever come to visit her.

                                                                    48.



67   INT. NOLAN HOUSE, PARLOR - VISITING DAY, 1931                  67

     We see the Woman dressed nicely, sitting in a chair
     reading a book. She takes a look out the window at the
     families on the lawn and bends back to her book.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               ...She taught me how to play the
               piano...

68   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1932                 68

     The Woman sitting with Benjamin teaching him how to play
     piano...playing a classical piece like Chopin...Benjamin
     trying his hand...sounding pretty bad...

                             THE WOMAN
               It isn't how well you play, it's
               how you feel about what you're
               playing. (whispers) Try this.

     And she plays a ragtime piece...New Orleans music...music
     for the other whole part of the soul... Benjamin tries
     his hand and actually plays it fairly well

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               You cannot help but put your
               entire self into the music.

     And he plays along with her...a piece he won't soon
     forget...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               There were many changes going on,
               some you could see... some you
               couldn't.

69   INT. A BATHROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1932                     69

     We see Benjamin taking a bath. An he notices a single
     gray hair floating on the surface...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Hair, had started growing, in all
               sorts of places...

     And he sees some hair is under his arms... and as he
     looks downward...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Along with other things...

     Benjamin, naked, looking at himself in a mirror... like a
     young teenage boy...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  I felt like I could do anything,
                  that I could sprout wings...

     And as he flexes his muscles, feeling like a man.

70   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                  70

     It's started to rain, the wind blowing, splattering rain
     against the window. Knocking.

                                DAISY
                  Oh, darlin', the pain...

                                CAROLINE
                  I'll get the nurse...

     She hurries out of the room. Daisy looks out the window.
     The maelstrom of wind and rain. Caroline comes back with
     a Nurse.

                                THE NURSE
                  You're not feeling too good?

     She adjusts the morphine drip.      Daisy lays back.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  Nobody seems to know whether to
                  stay or leave. The roads are
                  filled from New Orleans to Baton
                  Rouge already. I think I'm gonna
                  ride it out.
                       (finishing with the
                        drip)
                  There, that should make things
                  easier.

     Daisy starts to feel the effects of the drip...

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                       (to Caroline)
                  Have you had a chance to say your
                  goodbyes?

     Caroline nods.    The Nurse nods.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  My father waited four hours for my
                  brother to get here from Boger
                  City. He couldn't go without him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     She affectionately touches Daisy's cheek.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  She seems like a sweet woman.

     Caroline nods.

                                CAROLINE
                  I haven't spent as much time as I
                  would have like with her the last
                  few years.

     Another NURSE looks in...

                                THE WOMAN
                  You busy?

     The Nurse quickly   goes out of the room. Caroline sits
     back down looking   at her mother...Daisy opens her eyes...
     they look at each   other... Caroline knowing Daisy wants
     to hear the sound   of her voice...

                                CAROLINE
                       (taking up the book)

     Daisy shuts her eyes...

               the boats go up and down the
               river...

71   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY, 1932                       71

     The busy docks... Men waiting, hoping to find work...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               These were hard times... people
               were doing anything they could to
               find work...

     And we see Benjamin, with Mr. Daws, "the lightning man,"
     sitting on a bench with a line of other old men, "killing
     time," watching the boats going up and down the River...

                             MR. DAWS
               Did I ever tell you I was struck
               by lightning seven times? Once,
               when I was in a field tending to
               my cows.

     And we see just that, Mr. Daws, along with a cow of his,
     being hit by lightning.

                             A MAN'S (V.O.)

               Anybody want to make $2 for a
               day's work around here...

     Benjamin turns... And he sees a man in his late 40s with
     his three man crew, standing on the deck of a TUGBOAT,
     and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron... The man,
     its Captain MIKE... Has a thick Irish accent... For some
     reason none of the able-bodied men needing work
     respond...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               What's wrong, nobody wants to get
               their hands dirty...! Nobody wants
               to do an honest days work for an
               honest day's pay...!

                             A MAN
                    (warning them)

                  Are all you afraid of workin' for
                  a livin'? Somebody got to want a
                  job...

     Benjamin suddenly springs up at the opportunity, waving
     his arms...

                                  BENJAMIN
                  I do...!

                  You got your sea legs old man?

                       (feeling his legs)
                  I do. I think.

                  your ass on board, we'll sure as
                  hell find out!

     And as Benjamin gets on the boat, heading out to sea...

72   EXT. TUGBOAT, MISSISSIPPI RIVER, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1932       72

     And we see Benjamin "learning the ropes..." Helping to
     tow the freighters, into and out of the River ports...
     Benjamin in this element, like a boy, his hair blowing,
     thrilled to be on the boat, thrilled by the adventure...
     willing to do anything...

                  working da two-a-days... This
                  littl' fat bastard, "tug Irish,"
                  what they calls them. They say
                  the Irish the only one's stupid
                  `nough to work a tug. Them and
                  the Portuguese, as we all know how
                  stupid them Portuguese is. I
                  fin'ly get up the nerves and tell
                  him... "I don't wanta spend da
                  rest of my life on a goddamn
                  tugboat...!" You know what I'm

                  You didn't want to spend the rest
                  of your life on a tugboat.

                  Absolutely, damn right! So you
                  know what my father says? He says
                  "Who the hell you think you are?"
                  "What the hell you think you can
                  do?" I tell him. "Well if you
                  askin' -- I want to be a artist."
                  He laughs. He says, "If God
                  wanted you to be an artist he
                  would made you one." "God wanted
                  you to work a tugboat just like
                  me, and that's what you goin' to
                  do?" "Now, if I ever hear you
                  mention art again, I'll throw you
                  overboard!" Well, I went and I
                  show him... I made myself an
                  artist...

     And he suddenly takes off his shirt, pulls down his
     pants... And we see he's covered, from head to toe, with
     "his artwork," and incredible array of tattoos...

                                  THE GIRL
                   Again?

      She slows, turns to look... And sure enough... He's as
      ready as he's ever going to be... As she looks at him, a
      look bordering on amazement...

77    INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932      77

                                 THE GIRL
                   What are you, Dick Tracy or
                   something? I've got to rest...

      And that's just what she's doing... trying to catch her
      breath...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (in heaven)
                   Again?

78    INT. PARLOR, WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER - LATER STILL, 1932     78

      And we see Benjamin, at the door, happily smiling...

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Thank you...

                                 THE GIRL
                        (hurting)
                   No, thank you...

      Benjamin, floating on air, hovering, never wants to
      leave...

                                 THE GIRL (CONT'D)
                   Have a nice night...

                                BENJAMIN
                  You'll be here tomorrow?

                                THE GIRL
                  Every night, but Sunday...

     And she's finally able to go...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  It sure made me understand the
                  value of earning a living... the
                  things it can buy you..

     Benjamin turns to leave... we hear footsteps... And we
     see a man, putting on a raincoat, coming downstairs from
     one of those other rooms... We see it's Benjamin's
     father... THOMAS BUTTON... Seeing Benjamin he slows...
     Benjamin, unaware of who he is, turns and goes out...

79   EXT. STREET, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932              79

     It's a rainy night. Benjamin, feeling like a million
     bucks, walks along the street, going home... A
     chauffeured car pulls alongside him, the window rolled
     down... And we see Thomas Button in the car...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's awful wet out. Can I offer
                  you a ride somewhere...?

                                BENJAMIN
                  That's very kind of you, Sir.

     He gets into the car.

80   INT. THOMAS' CAR, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932            80

     They drive in awkward silence.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

                                  BENJAMIN
                  I'm Benjamin.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                       (saying the name to
                        himself)
                  Benjamin... Yes, Benjamin... It's
                  a pleasure to know you.

     They shake hands.

                  Would you like to stop and have a
                  drink, Benjamin?

81   INT. BAR, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932                    81

     A small old bar. Benjamin and his father sitting in the
     back... The waiter comes over, deferring to Benjamin's
     age...

                                THE WAITER
                  What will it be sir?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'll have whatever he's having.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  A Sazerac for both of us...with
                  whiskey instead of brandy...

     The waiter leaves.

                                THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                  You don't drink do you?

                                BENJAMIN
                  It's a night for firsts...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  How is that?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I've never been to a whore house
                  either.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's an... experience...

                                 BENJAMIN
                  It certainly is.
                       (and honestly)
                  I'm not very experienced about a
                  lot of things.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  That isn't a bad thing.

                                BENJAMIN
                  There's a first time for
                  everything.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  True enough. I don't mean to be
                  rude... but your hands seem awful
                  bent... It must be quite painful?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I don't really know what I have.
                  I have some form of a disease. I
                  have a lot of catching up to do.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  What kind of a disease?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I was born old.

     Thomas is quiet.    And for many things...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry.

                                BENJAMIN
                       (guileless)
                  No need to be. Nothing wrong with
                  old age.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry about your disease.

                                BENJAMIN
                  My mother says we're all born with
                  something...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  Your mother?

                                 BENJAMIN
                  I'm adopted.

     Thomas looks at him... They get their drinks... Tap
     glasses, and drink. Benjamin coughs at the taste... But
     forces it down... And as they laugh at his discomfort...

82   INT. THE BAR - FRENCH QUARTER - LATER THAT NIGHT, 1932          82

     Thomas and Benjamin deep in conversation... and both of
     them more than a few sheets to the wind... Benjamin,
     particularly overblown like any first time drunk...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  ... My wife passed away many years
                  ago...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  She died in childbirth.

     And there's a moment when it seems like Thomas might tell
     him, but despite the alcohol he thinks better of it...

                                THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                       (toasts, sadly)

                  To mothers and fathers...

     After some moments:

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  What line of work are you in, Mr.
                  Button?

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  Buttons. "Button's Buttons."
                  There isn't a button we don't
                  make. Our biggest competition is
                  B.F. Goodrich and his infernal
                  zippers...

     The waiter comes over.

                                THE WAITER
                  Would you gentlemen like another?

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  One more Benjamin?

                                BENJAMIN
                  If you'll let me pay for it, Mr.
                  Button...

     He takes out a little of his hard earned pay... proud of
     himself...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  What kind of work do you do?

                                BENJAMIN
                       (proud of himself)
                  I'm a tugboat man.

                                                                    62.

     The car's stopped outside the gate... Benjamin is
     drunkenly getting out...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
               I enjoyed talking to you...

                             BENJAMIN

     Benjamin slows...

               Would you mind, if time to time, I
               stopped by to say hello...?

                             BENJAMIN
                    (a drunken wave)
               Anytime.

                    (happily)
               Goodnight, Benjamin.

                    (drunkenly)
               Absolutely... Mr. Button...

     Benjamin turns inside. Thomas looks after him for a long
     moment... And then he drives away...

84   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1932                            84

     Benjamin holding the railing for support starts up the

               Where have you been!?

     And we see Queenie has been sitting in the front room...
     where she can see out the window...

                             BENJAMIN

     He doesn't mention the whore... But generically says...

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  I think mama... I'm going to...

     And to finish the evening, he throws up.

85   EXT. LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1934                      85

     The family's on the lawn...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I loved the weekends when she
                  would come and spend the night
                  with her grandmother.

86   INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - DAWN, 1934                         86

     Daisy, nine now, asleep in bed with Grandma Fuller... We

     awake...

                                BENJAMIN
                       (whispers)
                  Do you want to see something?   We
                  have to keep it secret.

     Daisy, always willing, always brave, gets up...

                       (whispers)
                  Get dressed. I'll meet you behind
                  the kitchen...

     And he leaves the room as quickly as he came...

87   EXT. BEHIND THE KITCHEN - NOLAN HOUSE - DAWN, 1934              87

     Benjamin, in an old peacoat, holding another -- waits...

     going quickly down the street...

     Fog. The first light of dawn. A full compliment of

     aboard...

     He goes downstairs to find -- Captain Mike sprawled

     empty bottle on the floor...

                  What's wrong with him?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I think he has mejembe.
                       (shaking him)
                  Captain Mike... could you take us
                  out?

     Captain Mike opens one eye... sees them standing there...

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  You know what day it is?

                                   BENJAMIN
                  Sunday.

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  Do you know what dat mean?

     He doesn't.

                                CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                  It means I was very drunk last
                  night.

                                BENJAMIN
                  You're drunk every night.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

               A close friend... I wanted to show
               her the River.

                             CAPT. MIKE
               I'm not supposed to be joy-ridin'
               with civilians... I could lose my
               license.

     That notion stops him for about a nanosecond.

90   EXT. THE TUGBOAT, THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - EARLY, 1934       90

     The tugboat making its way through the fog... Benjamin
     standing with Daisy on the prow... the wind in their
     faces... And suddenly out of the fog a HORN BLARES... As
     loud as anything they have ever heard... and moving out
     of the mist, horn still echoing, a huge ocean liner
     appears... With three other tugboats pushing it to sea...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               She put in for repair... a wounded
               duck... She's flyin' now...

     Captain Mike joins the tugs at the liner's side... the
     tugs sounding horns of their own... a symphony of a
     kind... What interests Benjamin...

                             BENJAMIN
               What does it take to build
               something like that?

     Passengers line the railing... continuing their
     adventure... And what interests Daisy...

                             DAISY
               Imagine all the places they're
               going to see...

     Daisy, thrilled, waves to them -- the passengers along
     the rail, waving back... Benjamin stands by Daisy, their
     hair blowing in the salty air....

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
                    (to Benjamin)
               I wish we could go with them...

     As they watch the liner, like a foggy dream, sailing
     away...

                                                                  66.



91   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           91

     The rain and wind knocking at the window...

                             DAISY
                    (murmurs)
               I wish we could have...
                    (the morphine)

                             CAROLINE
               Did you say something, Mother?

     And there's a hint of anxiety in Caroline now... anxiety
     coupled with exhaustion... Daisy doesn't say anything.
     Caroline worriedly looks out the window.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               It seems to be getting worse.

     Daisy doesn't respond.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               Are you hearing me, mother?

                             DAISY
               Look at that... time just seeped
               out of me...

                               CAROLINE
               What?

                             DAISY
               Somebody will come and mop it up
               and that will be the end...

     Caroline can only listen... She takes a deep breath,
     gathering her strength...And when her mother's settled
     again...

                             CAROLINE
               Do you want me to go on reading?

     She murmurs, "Hmmm?" as if she didn't know Caroline had
     stopped. Caroline looks back down at the book.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "Things were changing quickly."

92   INT. OLDER WOMAN'S ROOM   - NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY,       92

     TO SEE we're in his friend's room...

     haircut... the dog at their feet... the VICTROLA, as
     usual, is working overtime...

                             THE WOMAN
               I don't know how it's possible,
               you seem to have more hair...

                               BENJAMIN
                    (a   little arrogant)
               What if   I was to tell you I wasn't
               getting   older -- I was getting
               younger   than everybody else...

     And she then says, taking the wind out of his sails...

                             THE WOMAN
               Well, I'd feel very sorry for
               you... to have to see everybody
               you love, die before you.

     He's quiet, he hadn't thought of that...

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               That would be an awful
               responsibility...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had never thought about life or
               death that way before...

     He's still... And seeing he's upset, she says the most
     beautiful of things...

                             THE WOMAN
               Benjamin... We're meant to lose
               the people we love. How else
               would we know how important they
               are to us.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And one fall day... a familiar
               visitor came knocking on our
               door...

93   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1936                        93

     We see Benjamin knocking on the Woman's door...

                             BENJAMIN
               Would you like to go for a walk?

     There's no response. He opens it, going inside... The
     Woman is sitting in a chair by the window, the dog at her
     feet, the familiar Victrola playing dance music... He
     comes around the chair. And he sees she's still...
     perfectly still... her soul moved on...

                                                                  68.



94   EXT. CEMETERY PLOT, NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1936         94

     We see an old New Orleans paupers' cemetery... Benjamin
     and the mourners, and because he can't remember her name,
     around an unmarked grave...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               She had taught me how to play the
               piano.

     As Benjamin watches the woman go to her final rest.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               And she taught me what it meant to
               miss somebody.

95   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, ATTIC - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937        95

     We see Benjamin taking some things out of a dresser
     drawer, packing a suitcase...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had gone to a whore house, I'd
               had my first drink, I had said
               goodbye to one friend and buried
               another... In 1937, when I was
               coming to end of the 17th year of
               my life, I packed by bag.

     We see him putting some final things into the suitcase,
     closing it...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...and said goodbye...

96   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1937            96

     We see Benjamin moving through the parlor, one by one,
     saying his good-byes to the old people...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I knew, life being what it was, I
               would probably never see them
               again...

     The familiar faces... And as we watch him affectionately
     touch or talk to each of them... we can just see out a
     screen window DAISY, almost thirteen now, leaning against
     the side of the house... Out of sight... as if she didn't
     say goodbye, he wouldn't leave...

                                                                    69.



97   EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937                 97

     We see TIZZY on the porch holding Benjamin's suitcase for
     him... The woman's old dog lying beside him...

                             TIZZY
                    (shaking his hand)
               Good luck, son.

     And we see Queenie has come out onto the porch with her
     little girl... and he holds Queenie... tears running down
     her face...

                             BENJAMIN
               Goodbye, Mother...

     He bends to pet the old dog goodbye... He takes up his
     suitcase and starts off the porch... going down the
     walkway... he hesitates, and opens the gate... moving out
     onto the street... When suddenly Daisy is calling him...

                             DAISY
               Benjamin... Benjamin...

     She comes running.   He stops to let her catch up to
     him...

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
               Where are you going?

                               BENJAMIN
               To sea.    I'll send you a postcard.

                             DAISY
               From everywhere. Write me a
               postcard from everywhere...

     And with so much she wants to say, she can't say
     anything. So she runs away... He watches her go,
     watchers her thin legs running back down the street...
     and he turns and moves off along the street...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And I went off to sea...

     We see him in the distance, the "old man", a 17 year old,
     suitcase in hand, going to find out who he is and what he
     is to become...

                  There's a box of them... in a
                  velvet bag...

     Caroline, not sure what she wants, opens a red velvet
     bag... she finds a wooden cigar box...

     with postcards... Daisy, going through them...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)

                  Newfoundland... Baffin Bay...
                  Liverpool... Glasgow...Narvik...

     She takes one out, reading it... Taking up some others...
     looking... reading where they came from... reading off
     like an adventure...

     Daisy, the postcards, fond memories spread out on the bed
     around her...

                Captain Mike had contracted for

                engine, and a new sea winch... We

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S(V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Who got along fine at sea... but
                for some reason, once they were on
                dry land... couldn't stand the
                sight of each other...

101   EXT. DOCK SOMEWHERE - DAY, 1937                             101

      The brothers getting off the tug... and no sooner have
      they hit dry land they immediately get into a fist
      fight...

                   There was John Grimm, who fit his
                   name... from Belvedere, South
                   Dakota...

      worst...

                   You know one in every eight boats
                   never returns, all hands lost at
                   sea.

                   ...and Pleasant Curtis who never
                   said a word to anyone... except to
                   himself...

      The asocial Pleasant... talking to himself as he works...

      on a cleat, reading her letter...

                                 DAISY'S (V.O.)
                   ...I told him they had invited me

      Daisy moving with technical proficiency -- but it's
      bloodless, without any real distinction... She gets nods -
      - but no kudos...

                   One of the "corps"... another
                   dancing gypsy...

      We see Daisy training... just another lithe body.

108   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                 108

      Daisy in bed... Picking up another postcard, she stops,
      reading, slowing at a painful memory...

                                 DAISY
                   Oh. Then he wrote me... "I've met
                   somebody... and I've fallen in
                   love..."

109   INT. LANDMARK BUILDING, DANCE LOFT, NEW YORK, NIGHT, 1941 109

      And we see Daisy, sitting on the dance floor reading the
      very same POSTCARD, brokenhearted...

                                 A MAN
                   Places everybody... Once again...

      The troupe moves into their places...Daisy still just
      part of the crowd... The music starts... Now as Daisy
      dances... it is filled with pathos and lost love...and
      everyone takes notice.

110   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                 110

      Daisy reading the very postcard some sixty odd years
      later... as if reading it for the first time...

                   "...I've met somebody...and I've

                        (and realizing)
                   ...sixty years ago.

      She's quiet, looking out the window...

                   Did you love him, mother?

      the water running down the window...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                Murmansk is on the Barrent Sea,
                the only ice-free ocean port in
                the Soviet Union...

111   EXT. MURMANSK HARBOR, RUSSIA - DAY, 1941                    111

      We see "Chelsea" working with other tugs as snow falls in
      the crowded Russian Harbor.

      They tow a large freighter into port.

                Benjamin...

      Benjamin, who is coiling rope on the bow, stands and
      looks at the Captain.

                              CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                     (squinting down at
                      him, wanting to
                      know)
                Tell me how's it happen you showed
                up you were no bigger than a
                bollard. Now either I drink a
                helluva lot more than I think I
                do, or you sprouted... What's your
                secret?

      And Benjamin, tired of explanations, and what comes first
      to mind...

                              BENJAMIN
                Well Captain, you do drink a
                lot...

      And that makes perfect sense to Mike...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                     (taking a drink,
                      saluting)
                Goddamn right I do!

      And Benjamin stands on the bow... ready to see the
      world...

                We stayed at a small hotel with
                the grand name, "The Winter
                Palace."

                                                                   74A.

      Snow covers the street outside of a turn-of-the Century
      hotel... a front window looks into its lobby... "The
      Winter Palace Hotel."

113   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941                   113

      There's a packed BAR off the lobby... We see Benjamin
      sitting with Captain Mike, their crew, and a mixture of
      other seamen, Russians and other ethnics, all speaking
      different languages, sitting and standing around tables
      cluttered with bottles and glasses... Captain Mike,
      drunk, his shirt off, is telling a Russian sailor,
      another interpreting for him -- about a tattoo he has
      over his heart... an upside down hummingbird...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                I saws this tattoo puts on a man's
                back in Singapore by Sakumoro, the
                greatest tattoo artist ever lived.
                I puts it on myself from mem'ry.

      And now we know why it's upside down...

                              CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                This idn't just anoter bird! Its
                heart rate's twelve hunerd beats a
                minute...! Its wings beats eighty
                times a second...! If you was to
                stop their wings from beatin, they
                would be dyin' in less than ten
                seconds...This is no ordinary
                bird, this is a frikkin' miracle!
                They slowed down the wings
                              (MORE)

      And he draws on a napkin a FIGURE EIGHT...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Does you know what the figure-
                   eight is the mathematical symbol
                   of...?!

      Pointing at the symbol...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Infinity!

      And for some drunken reason, no matter what language they
      might speak, they all laugh...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Everybody, no matter what
                   differences they had, the
                   languages, the color of their
                   skin, had one thing in common...
                   they were drunk every single
                   night...

      Then there's a shout -- and as if to underscore things,
      the Brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other
      again...

114   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941               114

      We see Benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to
      take him to his room. He gets in, the elevator operator
      about to shut the grill door...

                                 A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                   Would you wait, please...

      And we see a WOMAN in her late 40s... getting on the
      elevator... Benjamin looks over at her...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her name was Elizabeth Abbott. She
                   was not beautiful. She was plain
                   as paper... But she was as pretty
                   as any picture to me...

      "Plain as paper," ELIZABETH ABBOTT... Directly behind her
      walks a tall, tired man, in his 50s... By the look of his
      ruddy face, and her silent mien... they're both drunk...
      Benjamin finds himself looking at her...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   What are you looking at?

      She has a distinctly English accent. Benjamin doesn't say
      a word.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   If you must know, we have a long
                   standing agreement never to go to
                   bed sober. Isn't that right
                   darling?

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her husband was Walter Abbott...He
                   was Chief Minister of the British
                   Trade Mission in Murmansk... and
                   he was a spy...

      They ride up. Elizabeth has her shoes off...She sees him
      noting her stocking feet... The elevator finally rattles
      to a stop, and George and Elizabeth get off... Starting
      down the hall...she abruptly turns to say to Benjamin...
      so that it's completely understood...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I broke the heel off of one of my
                   shoes...I don't usually walk
                   around in my bare feet...

      And as he watches her saunter along the hallway... the
      way drunks do... endeavoring to keep her dignity...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   They were long days there...

      Benjamin on the tug, but it's less fun now, not much
      adventure, just hard work... Fighting the snow and the
      wind, they tow a large freighter into port...

                And longer nights...

                   One particular night... when I was
                   having trouble sleeping...

117   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941                117

      Benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively
      into the empty lobby... He slows, seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT
      in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely... and it's
      not the first time for her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry... I can't sleep...

      She's quiet... She finally looks up... but doesn't say
      anything... There's an awkward moment...exacerbated by
      the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I was going to make some
                   tea...would you like some?

      She shakes her head no... He crosses through the empty
      bar, into an old KITCHEN... He looks for tea... Puts
      water in a kettle... As he watches the kettle boil...
      Elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she
      were chilled, stands by the door... Benjamin, without
      asking, takes a cup for her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Milk...? Honey...?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Some honey, thank you.

      He finds a large honey jar... and seeing some dead flies
      in with the sweet syrup he asks...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you like flies with your tea?

      She smiles...for the first time... A thin smile... He
      starts to stir the tea... Elizabeth stopping him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You must let it steep for a
                   minute...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Steep?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Sit. There's a proper way to make
                   tea.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Where I'm from, they just want it
                   to be hot.

      She doesn't smile. He gives her a cup of tea... She
      cradles the cup... They're quiet, drinking their
      tea...two strangers... After some moments...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You're a seaman? I don't mean to
                   be rude...but aren't you rather
                   old to be working on a boat?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   There's no age limit... as long as
                   you can do the work...

      She nods... They're quiet again. She sits at an old wood
      counter.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You have trouble sleeping?

      It's an invitation to sit with her... He pulls a stool
      over sitting across from her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I didn't know I did... I usually
                   sleep like a baby. Something kept
                   me up.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I never sleep... Well, rarely
                   anyway...

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   My father, when he was in his
                   eighties, was so sure he was going
                   to die in his sleep... He would
                   only take naps during the
                   afternoon... so that death
                   couldn't catch him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Did he?

                Did he what?

                              BENJAMIN
                Die in his sleep?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                He died sitting in his favorite
                chair listening to his favorite
                program on the radio.

                              BENJAMIN
                     (smiles)
                He must have known something.

      She smiles at the idea... Another one... that goes as
      quickly as it's come... And it's quiet again...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                My husband's the British Trade
                Minister. We've been here fourteen
                months... We were supposed to be
                going to Peking... but it just
                never did work out. It never does
                seem to work out. Have you been to
                the Far East?

                              BENJAMIN
                I haven't really been anywhere. I
                mean outside different harbors.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Where are you from?

                              BENJAMIN
                New Orleans, Louisiana.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                     (pure Elizabeth)
                I didn't know there was another
                one.

      Which escapes him.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I've never been to America.
                Everywhere else. But not America.
                Am I missing anything?

                              BENJAMIN
                     (simply, guileless)
                The Mississippi River.

                And she told me all the places she
                had been, and what she had seen...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I can tell you what bars look like
                in places all over the world...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And we talked until just before
                the dawn...

118   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DAYBREAK, 1941       118

      The first hint of daylight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Thank you for the tea...

      She leaves as quietly as she entered... Benjamin remains
      standing for a moment...then shuts the light off behind
      him.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                ...And we went back to our
                rooms... to our separate lives...

      And as he goes back up the quiet stairs...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And every night... we would meet
                in the middle Of the night...

119   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941 119

      Benjamin padding downstairs... slowing... happy to see
      Elizabeth, in her bathrobe, sitting in the empty lobby,
      waiting for him...

120   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - BEFORE DAWN, 1941 120

      Elizabeth and Benjamin quietly talking...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                A hotel in the middle of the night
                can be a magical place...

      And we see the empty front desk and tiny silver bell...
      The vacant lobby, with its musty old rugs... The open
      elevator, waiting... The dining room, with its crisp
      white tablecloths.

                   A radiator hissing. A sink
                   dripping. A floor creaking. A
                   curtain blowing.

      We see and hear it all... All the little sounds, a
      symphony, that make up life in a hotel in the middle of
      the night... Benjamin and Elizabeth sitting quietly
      drinking their tea.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There is something peaceful, even
                   comforting, knowing that people
                   you love are asleep in their beds,
                   where nothing can harm them...

      Queenie and Tizzy asleep together in her bed... Their
      child on the floor... The old people in their beds in the
      old house. Ngunda Oti asleep in a room somewhere. The
      unnamed woman's grave. A different kind of sleep. And of
      course Daisy, in a New York apartment loft with other
      dancers... sleeping peacefully.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

                   The wrong impression?

                   You must think I don't love my

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Why do you say that?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Married women don't usually sit
                   with strange men in a hotel in the
                   middle of the night. I certainly
                   don't.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (honestly)
                   I don't know what married women do
                   or don't do.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Let's get one thing straight. I
                   love him very much. I happen to
                   think he is one of the smartest
                   and most considerate men I ever
                   met. It is not his fault I decided
                   to spend my life in his shadow.

      And with that she gets up and leaves... Benjamin, left
      with that thought...

123   INT. DINING ROOM, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941         123

      Benjamin and Elizabeth in the empty dining room at a
      table with a white tablecloth... with some wine and
      cheese... She's laughing now, measurably loosened up...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   He started to take his pants
                   off... I'm afraid he misread me
                   completely...

      He laughs. She looks through her wine glass at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Do you notice how people look
                   better through a wine glass...

      He holds his up.... looking at her....She moves her glass
      just looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You're a good looking man with or
                   without a wine glass...

      She picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to
      his... She puts her finger over his making a cross...

                   We are all just crossing in the
                   night. Sometimes we intersect.

      She leaves her finger there for a moment... lingering...
      She abruptly moves it away...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   I should go to bed... he'll be up
                   soon.

      She hesitates... And she kisses him, and then hurries out
      of the dining room... As Benjamin sits in the empty
      dining room... the kiss left on his lips...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was the first time a woman had
                   ever kissed me. It's something you
                   never forget.

                   Are you upset, Mother?

      She doesn't say anything. Caroline, seeing her feet have
      come out of the covers, caring, fixes her blanket.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Would you like some socks?

      Daisy's quiet.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Do you want me to stop reading?

      Daisy's answer for her is...

                                 DAISY
                   It must have been very cold. I'm
                   glad he had somebody to keep him
                   warm.

      Which Caroline takes as her cue to read on...

                                 CAROLINE

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You're delicious just as you
                   are...

      She laughs, taking his arm, walking to the dining room as
      if going to dinner... They sit at a table... which she
      has set for them... Caviar and Vodka...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Don't bother with the cheese or
                   the wine here, they're quite
                   common... but the caviar and the
                   vodka are plentiful and sublime...

      She feeds him a spoonful of the caviar...Unaccustomed to
      it, he swallows it too quickly...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Take your time... If you eat it
                   all at once there will be nothing
                   left to enjoy... savor it...

      She gives him another spoonful... and takes one
      herself... He takes his time... They both do... savoring
      it...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (pouring)
                   Now, a swallow of vodka...

      Which they do... She laughs... Looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You haven't been with many women
                   have you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. Not many. At least none on a
                   Sunday.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (smiles)
                   I feel like I'm with a virgin.

      She's not far off... And it's a lovely thought... and it
      makes her think of her youth.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                When I was nineteen, I tried to
                become the first woman to swim the
                English Channel...

126   EXT. THE ENGLISH CHANNEL ­ DAY, 1911                        126

      And we see just that....Young Elizabeth, in goggles, her
      body covered with grease, swimming with two escort boats
      across the English Channel.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                The current was so strong...that
                for every stroke I took... I was
                pushed two strokes back...

      And we see just that, Elizabeth fighting the current...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                I swam for 32 hours... I was only
                two miles from the French shore...

      Elizabeth in sight of the lights of Calais...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When it started to rain...

      And it starts to rain on her... Harder and harder... the
      shore is suddenly gone from sight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When I couldn't go any further,
                and I just stopped...

      And we see her being taken onto a boat, a blanket wrapped
      around her...

127   EXT. CALAIS, BEACH - NIGHT, 1911                            127

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                They asked me whether I would try
                again...?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Why wouldn't I?

      She smiles, a young girl, full of life...

                                                                   86.



128   INT. DINING ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - LATE NIGHT, 1941        128

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I never did. As a matter of fact,
                I have never done much of anything
                with my life after that...

      And it's quiet. She touches his rough hand.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                Your hands are very rough... you
                have grease under your nails...

      She runs her fingernail along his face...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I can feel the wind on your
                face...

      They look at each other. And this time, Benjamin kisses
      her. It lingers... She stops herself...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I'm afraid it's the witching
                hour...

      She quickly gets up... And she's gone. As Benjamin sits
      in the empty dining room.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                It took me a long time to go to
                sleep.

129   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER LATE NIGHT, 1941      129

      We see Elizabeth nicely dressed, a bottle of champagne in
      her hand, sitting anxiously waiting. The elevator doors
      open. Benjamin in a suit and tie, as handsome as we've
      seen him steps out. She stands, takes his arm.

                              BENJAMIN
                Do I look okay? I borrowed it from
                one of the men. It's his church
                suit.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                You take my breath away.

      She walks with him, champagne bottle in hand, through the
      empty lobby...




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   The thing about clothing is, it
                   should make you feel comfortable,
                   then you will be comfortable...
                   Come, let's take a walk...

130   EXT. MURMANSK, RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941                    130

      Their arms in each other's, their breath showing in the
      night, they walk through the sleeping Russian town, their
      shadows in the moonlight. They stop to share a drink from
      the champagne bottle. They laugh.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I feel so much younger when I'm
                   with you...

      And it seems he's about to go on... But Elizabeth,
      flattered, takes it metaphorically...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   That's such a nice thing to say.
                   You make me feel years younger,
                   too. I wish I was. I would
                   change so many things. I would
                   undo all of my mistakes.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   What mistakes?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I kept waiting, thinking I would
                   do something to change my
                   circumstance... Do something...
                   But I never did... It's an awful
                   waste, you can never get it
                   back... wasted time...

      They're quiet.    She looks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (abruptly)
                   If we're going to have an affair,
                   you're never to look at me during
                   the day, we must always part by
                   sunrise, and we can never say "I
                   love you..."

      He's quiet...




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                   88.

130   CONTINUED:                                                  130

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   And when it is over I will send
                   you a card that will simply say
                   goodbye... Those are the rules...

      They stand in the cold. His answer is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Are you as cold as I am?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (laughs)
                   My god, colder.

      They stop to finish what's left of the champagne,
      Elizabeth hurling the bottle. The bottle falling silently
      into some fresh snow.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You can't even break a bottle
                   here.

      They look at each other and they kiss. And without
      anything else needing to be said, they start back...

131   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941      131

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Get a key.

      Benjamin goes behind the registration desk, taking an
      empty room key off a hook... They cross to the
      elevator...

132   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941 132

      They stand in the elevator as it ascends. Anticipating
      what's to come...

133   INT. HALLWAY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941    133

      They move along a dark hallway. He quietly unlocks an
      empty room door... And as he follows her into the room...
      the door closing.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She was the first woman who ever
                   loved me.

                                                                  89.



134   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER DAY, 1941            134

      Benjamin, in his peacoat, and stocking cap, snow on him,
      hurries into the hotel from work... He runs to the
      elevator, the doors just closing.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Hold it...

      It opens. He goes inside.      And Elizabeth's husband is
      standing in the elevator.

135   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE DAY, 1941     135

      They silently ride up, not a word exchanged. The
      elevator stops. Elizabeth's husband gets out. As he
      quietly walks down the hall...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   We saw each other every night...
                   we always used the same room...

136   INT. HALL "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT TO DAWN, 1941     136

      We see the key going into the door... Benjamin and
      Elizabeth going inside closing the door behind them...
      leaving us with the quiet hallway.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   But each time seemed new and
                   different...

      And we see them as dawn creeps along the hallway,
      Benjamin and Elizabeth, leaving the room, not wanting to
      part, passionately kissing, and as they start to go their
      separate ways...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispering)
                   Elizabeth...

      She turns.

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (whispers)
                   You should swim the English
                   channel again.

      And as she laughs to herself and hurries off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Until one night...

                                                                   90.



137   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1941           137

      We see Benjamin coming down the stairs, into the lobby to
      meet Elizabeth. And he slows...Elizabeth isn't there. He
      looks into the bar...the kitchen....the dining room... He
      goes back to the lobby, sitting on a lone sofa, waiting
      for her... A mouse runs across the marble floor, stops,
      looks at him and runs off... And he sits and waits.

138   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - EARLY MORNING, 1941 138

      Snow shrouds the windows. We see Benjamin has fallen
      asleep on the sofa... There's the distinctive BELLOW of
      Captain Mike's VOICE. Benjamin wakes... He follows the
      bellowing to find Captain Mike with the tugboat CREW in
      the bar...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Roosevelt says we all got to do
                our part! After them Japs
                attacked Pearl Harbor everyone's
                got to! The Chelsea's been
                commissioned to serve in the
                United States Navy, to repair,
                tow, salvage and rescue... Anybody
                don't want to go to war, now's the
                time to say so... Once you set
                foot on that boat again, you're in
                the Navy friend!

                              BENJAMIN
                     (right away)
                I'll go captain!

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Easy old timer.
                     (to the men)
                I'll hold it against no man. But
                speak up now or forever hold your
                water.

      And the Cook, Prentis Mayes...

                              THE COOK
                I was planning on talking to you
                Cap'n Mike... My wife's doing
                poorly. I'd like to see her one
                more time...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                     (understanding)
                You're free to get home any way
                you can Mr. Mayes.

      And the cook walks off.

                                 JOHN GRIMM
                        (always dour)
                   Who do you intend to have cook
                   then? One of the leading causes
                   of death at sea is food poisoning,
                   right after inadequate safety
                   equipment.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I grew up cooking, sir. I'll take
                   the job, if I'm not too old to
                   serve.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You a real Johnny on the Spot,
                   Benjamin. I'll take any able
                   bodied mens who wants kick shit
                   out of the Japs and the Huns.

      And with no one dissenting...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Then that's it! We's goin' to
                   war, gentlemen!

      And filled with fervor, they give a cheer.

139   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, "WINTER PALACE" LATER, 1941               139

      Benjamin unlocking the door to his room. An ENVELOPE has
      been left under the door, he opens it.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   She had left a note. She wrote,
                   "it was nice to have met you."
                   That was it.

      And as he stands holding the letter in his room at the
      small Russian hotel:

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And so, I went to war.

140   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN, SOMEWHERE - NIGHT, 1941           140

      The men on the tug on a dark gray sea....

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It wasn't the war we expected. We
                   would tow crippled ships... scraps
                   of metal...

                   across the high seas... If there
                   was a war, we didn't see it...

      And what seemed exciting, the idea of war... is
      tedious... The "Chelsea" towing a strange hulking shape
      on the dark, empty sea...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There was a man assigned with
                   us... The Chief Gunner loved the
                   Navy, and most of all, he loved
                   America.

                                 THE MAN'S (V.O.)
                   There is no other country in the
                   world...! When YOU spell America,
                   A.M.E.R.I.C.A. You're spelling
                   freedom...!

      We see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen...
      sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun...
      ready to kick some enemy ass...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   His name was Dennis Smith and he
                   was a full blooded Cherokee... His
                   family had been in America for
                   over five hundred years.

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                   You have these pacifists. They
                   say they won't fight on
                   conscience. Where would we be if
                   everybody decided to act according
                   to their conscience?

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (out his Window)
                   Keeps it down, would you chief!

      He goes back inside... And as they settle into their
      tasks..

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                        (on his gun, to
                         himself, the last
                         word)
                   Where else can you shoot white
                   people and get away with it...

      Benjamin's the only one around to hear him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I worked in the kitchen...

                                                                   93.



141   INT. THE TUGBOAT KITCHEN - DAY, 1941                         141

      Benjamin busy preparing a meal in the galley kitchen. The
      Perpetually silent Pleasant Curtis, on kitchen duty,
      helping him with the preparation... while they work...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (trying to make
                      conversation)
                You're from the Kentucky mountains
                aren't you? It must be pretty
                there..

      Pleasant Curtis doesn't say a word. Benjamin shrugging,
      puts the pie in an oven.

142   INT. THE GALLEY - TUGBOAT - NIGHT                            142

      The men; including Dennis Smith, Pleasant Curtis, John
      Grimm, the "fighting" Brody twins, Benjamin serving them,
      silently eating dinner, rolling with endless rolling
      Ocean. Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves.

                              JOHN GRIMM
                There's something not normal about
                him.

      As they silently eat, mostly bored...

                              DENNIS SMITH
                     (looking outside)
                Whoever said "War is hell,"
                doesn't know shit from shinola.

143   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN -- ANOTHER NIGHT, 1942          143

      We see "Chelsea," a steel tow line splayed out from its
      winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the
      ocean...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We were towing a British
                freighter, that had gone dead in
                the water, 800 miles to Halifax
                for repair...

      We see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow
      line run out some thousand feet behind them...

144   INT. CREW QUARTER, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942     144

      We see Benjamin awake in his bunk, Dennis Smith asleep in
      the bunk above him.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

144   CONTINUED:                                                     144

      Pleasant Curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him...
      Benjamin looking out at the black sea... and out of the
      silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks...

                                  PLEASANT CURTIS
                   I've been watching you. You seem
                   trustworthy. If something happens
                   to me... could you see this gets
                   to my wife...?

      He hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   He had given me all of his pay...
                   he hadn't spent a dime of it...

                                 PLEASANT CURTIS
                   If anything happens I want my
                   family to know I was thinking
                   about them, and if I could have,
                   I'd have come back home.

      And that said he turns back over... And as Benjamin looks
      at the dark foreboding sea... suddenly:

                                 CAPT. MIKE (OVER)
                        (calls)
                   All hands on deck!!!

      They bolt from their bunks... Going outside...

145   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     145

      Captain Mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking
      at the ocean... They see bodies of men, dead men,
      floating by them... One and two at first... then three
      and four... and then more and more until they are moving
      through a carpet of bodies...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   The war found us.

      As they move through the water... their propeller
      literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to
      veritably shut their engines down...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   A transport carrying 900 men had
                   been hit by a torpedo. We were
                   first to arrive at the scene...

      And as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT
      VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking
      quickly... Fuel oil burning on the water...
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       95.

      It's then we see the true horror of the men in the
      water... in the burning black oil... The transport boat
      silently slips into the water, disappearing under the
      sea...

146   EXT. TUGBOAT - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     146

      As the tug moves through the thick black smoke...
      Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the
      rails...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   There wasn't a sound...

      Except for the   lapping of water, and the tugboat's
      engines, there   isn't... just the silence of death...
      Something else   appears, doming onto the surface like a
      spectre... the   U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc...
      looking to see   the results... Captain Mike sees the
      sub...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (mad as hell)
                   We can't run from the fucker and
                   we can't hide...! There's only one
                   thing we can do...!
                        (and he shouts)
                   Battle Stations...!!!

      They run to their battle stations...

147   INT. PILOT HOUSE, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942         147

      Captain Mike at the wheel in the pilot house, turning the
      tug, furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine...

148   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                      148

      A German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the
      Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the
      tugboat... Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead
      cut open, bleeding... Despite the strafing the tug is
      relentless... The submarine, seeing it is about to be
      rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat
      ramming the submarine... severing the U-Boat in half. The
      concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in
      the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo
      exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process,
      blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men
      on the stern blown to pieces... Benjamin's literally
      thrown against the wheel house... He manages to get to
      his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... There's a
      man's voice...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      96.

      And he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body
      covered with blood... Benjamin bends to him... Captain
      Mike trembling as he lays dying...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   Look at what they did! They shot
                   holes in me! They shots the hell
                   out my paintin'!

      His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is
      riddled...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   You've seen a lot of things. Tell
                   me it's going to be alright.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're going to heaven Captain
                   Mike. You're going to heaven.

      Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying.
      And a light comes in Captain Mike's eyes... an
      understanding.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You can be mad as a mad dawg at
                   the way things wents... You can
                   swear, curse the fates, regret
                   every'ting you ever dids... but
                   when it comes to the end... You
                   have to lets go...

      He looks in Benjamin's old eyes....

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Give me a hand, old man...

      And as he holds Benjamin's hand ready to meet his
      maker...

149   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATE AFTERNOON, 1942            149

      There are two destroyers and a hospital ship in the
      battle zone flow... Planes circling... The water still
      speckled with debris, and bodies...

150   EXT. A LIBERTY SHIP, THE NORTH ATLANTIC - DUSK, 1942           150

      We see Benjamin at the railing of a Liberty Ship.. He
      watches the "Chelsea" sink, disappearing under the sea...

                   736 men died that day... I said my
                   goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis
                   Smith, John Grimm who was right,
                   he was going to die there... I
                   sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his
                   money... I said goodbye to the
                   twin, Vic Brody...

      He instinctively turns, and sees Rick Brody looking out a
      porthole, lost without his twin brother...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   And to Mike Clark... Captain of
                   the tugboat "Chelsea."

      A storage cabinet is opened, a sailor taking out a
      wreath, from a supply of just such wreaths...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You mind...

      The Sailor shrugs, giving him the wreath...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I said goodbye to all the other
                   men... who had dreams of their
                   own... All the men who wanted to
                   be plumbers or singers or
                   insurance salesmen or doctors...
                   or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

      And suddenly, angrily, he throws the wreath into the
      water...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Out here, death didn't seem
                   normal.

      Benjamin standing at the rail of the ship... no longer a
      boy... And a SAILOR standing beside him....

                                 THE SAILOR
                   This don't get fixed...

      Benjamin's quiet. When suddenly a HUMMINGBIRD comes
      flying across the water... It circles the wreath, the way
      Hummingbirds do... and then flies off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   ...I'd never seen a hummingbird
                   that far out to sea before...

      And as Benjamin stands at the railing, looking at the
      sea...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                In the spring of 1945.... when I
                was 26 years old... I went home...

151   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            151

      We see Benjamin, suitcase in hand, going up the walk to
      the old house. We're struck by the difference... the old
      man who had left to see the world has returned a
      strikingly handsome man in his fifties. The old blind
      dog, smelling ham, ambles off the porch to meet him.
      Nothing seems to have changed. An old woman we don't
      know is rocking on the porch. A black girl, just 14... is
      hanging out wash...

                              BENJAMIN
                Is your mother home?

                              THE GIRL
                She's gettin' supper ready....

      He goes up the porch, inside....

152   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            152

      Some old folks are in the front room... Nobody we know...
      He moves by them into the kitchen... the stovetop smoking
      and gurgling... He goes into the dining room... Queenie
      is busy setting the table... He watches her for a
      moment...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (quietly)
                Queenie...

      She turns, seeing him... she drops a plate...

                              QUEENIE
                Lord have mercy....you're home...

      She runs to embrace him... We see she's aged... the eight
      years he's been gone... and the 25 years or so since
      we've known her... now in her fifties...

                              THE GIRL'S (V.0.)
                     (asks)
                Who is that mama?

      The Girl comes inside... curious...

                                 QUEENIE
                   Your brother, Benjamin...

                                 THE GIRL
                   I didn't know he was my brother.

                                 QUEENIE
                        (laughs)
                   There's a shit load of things you
                   don't know...

      But her interest is in Benjamin....

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (studying him)
                   You look like you've been born
                   again... you're younger than the
                   springtime... I think that
                   preacher laid the hands on you
                   brought you a second life... I
                   knew the moment I saw you -- you
                   were special... Every night I got
                   on my knees asking the Good Lord
                   to bring you back safely. Remember
                   what I told you...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You never know what's comin' for
                   you.

      And they both share a good laugh at her homily... glad to
      be together once again.

                                 QUEENIE
                   Did you learn anything worth
                   repeating?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I saw a lot of things.

      She touches the scar, from the bullet, on his forehead.

                                 QUEENIE
                   You seen some pain.

      He nods.

                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                   Some joy too?

      He nods, that too. And she holds him again.

                Where's Tizzy?

                              QUEENIE
                Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one
                night last April. He's sleeping
                comfortably now in the cemetery on
                St. James street, God rest his
                soul...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm so sorry...

      She turns from him so as not to cry....

                              QUEENIE
                There's only one or two of them
                left now... They all just about
                new... waitin' their turn like
                everybody else... I am so glad to
                have I you back. Now we got to
                find you some proper work and get
                you married right...

      And as she goes about readying the table for dinner,
      humming to herself...

153   EXT. PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE - EVENING, 1945                       153

      Benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters. And feeling out
      of place, out of time, he gets up and goes inside.

154   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1945                 154

      We see Benjamin playing the piano in the parlor, the
      particular tune the Woman had taught him... an old man
      sitting nearby, seemingly listening... Queenie, looking
      in...

                              QUEENIE
                You're wasting your time... he's
                stone deaf... You'll be staying in
                what was Mrs. DeSeroux's room now,
                you're too much of a man to stay
                in the attic anymore.

      She goes about her business... And as Benjamin goes back
      to playing the piano for the deaf man... playing for
      himself...

155   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                    155

      We see Mr. Daws, much older now, asleep in an easy chair.

      Benjamin standing at the familiar window, listening to
      the silence of the house...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It's a funny thing about coming
                   home. Smells the same. Looks the
                   same. Feels the same.

      Mr. Daws awakens.    Seeing Benjamin.   As if he never left.

                                 MR. DAWS
                   Did I ever tell you I've been
                   struck by lightning seven times.
                   Once I was sitting in my truck
                   listening to the radio.

      And we see just that Mr. Daws sitting in his truck
      getting belted by lightning.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   You realize what's changed, is
                   you...

      While Benjamin stands locking out the window:

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   And one evening, not long after I
                   had been back...

156   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ONE EVENING, 1945                 156

      We see Benjamin, coming down the stairs. He happens to
      glance out a casement window... He slows... He can just
      see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate. He moves
      to the next landing...where he can see a figure is
      getting out of the cab... The figure of a young woman,
      wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots... She
      strides through the gate... It takes us a moment to
      recognize her... the leggy thirteen year old girl is
      gone... replaced by a confident woman in her early
      twenties... with her red hair and her blue eyes she could
      be no one else but DAISY. Benjamin follows her progress,
      moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened
      windows... She moves gracefully past the porch with its
      swings... The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her,
      comes to greet her... Daisy going around to the back of
      the house... Benjamin moving to the back door, and just
      as Daisy starts to knock... Benjamin opening it...
      Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him.... and
      asks...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Daisy... it's me, Benjamin.

      She hardly can believe her eyes...

                   Benjamin...Oh my God it's you...
                   Of course it's you...

      They embrace, and there's a moment when the touch is not
      just of old friends, but something different... and they
      both, in that moment recognize that things will never be
      the same... Daisy, over-hugging him... the way young
      people do...

                                  DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin, how are you? It's been
                   such a long time... There's so
                   much I want to know... When did
                   you come back?

                                 BENJAMIN

                   I spoke to Queenie...she told me
                   you were in the war...somewhere at
                   sea... I was so worried about
                   you...

                                   BENJAMIN
                        (simply)
                   I'm okay.

                   When I had left she was a girl...
                   and a woman had taken her place...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I can't get over you -- You are so
                   lovely...

                   You stopped writing.

                   Is it as cold as they say...? You
                   wrote you met somebody... did it
                   work out...?

                                  BENJAMIN
                        (holding out)
                   Remember this?

      He's comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to
      them, Rudyard Kipling's "Just So." She sits on the bed...
      Benjamin sitting beside her... the two shoulder to
      shoulder... Daisy looking through the book... and
      reading....

                                 DAISY
                   ...This is the picture of Old Man
                   Kangaroo at five in the
                   afternoon..."

      She looks at him.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                You don't look like an old man
                anymore...You always said you were
                different... I think you must
                be...

      He doesn't say anything. The two of them sitting with
      their backs to us like the old friends they are...They
      touch... acutely aware of their proximity and before it
      can go any further...

                              BENJAMIN
                Are you hungry? Would you like to
                get something to eat?

                              DAISY
                I would love that...

      And the moment's gone...

160   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT                           160

      ...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion...
      and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man
      helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting
      out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked,
      elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear
      Daisy's voice, from somewhere else...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...I danced for a man named
                Ballenchine...He's a famous
                choreographer. He said I had a
                perfect line. They asked
                Ballenchine to describe what he
                did. He said, "I'm a carpenter."
                Isn't that amazing? In one of his
                rehearsals a dancer fell. He put
                it into the production. Can you
                imagine that in a classical
                ballet? A dancer intentionally
                falling? He isn't the only one,
                Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein,
                Richard Pleasant, Lucia
                Chase...There's a whole new word
                for dance now, it's called
                abstract..."

      The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another
      man showing her inside... Benjamin forgotten for the
      slightest of moments at the door... going after her.

                                                                   106.



161   INT. NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT, 1945                    161

      A crowded New Orleans restaurant. Daisy as a maitre d in
      slow motion is showing her to a table... Men's, and even
      women's, eyes following her...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...They have torn up all the
                conventions... the straight up and
                down style, all the things that
                bound dancers...It's not about the
                formality of the dance...the
                classical structure...it's about
                what the dancer's feeling...there
                are no rules; the movement can be
                tense or relaxed, abrupt or
                flowing, carefree or somber, it
                may suggest love or hate,
                attraction or repulsion. The
                unexpected shifts of weight or
                energy -- not just to shock but to
                reinvent tradition...putting the
                familiar form to new and
                unexpected uses. It's so basic
                Just you alone with your body...

      They reach a table... A chair in slow motion swept out
      for her to sit... another man in slow motion putting a
      napkin in her lap...

                              DAISY (V.O)
                They understand America's vigor
                and physicality -- they understand
                the freshness of the American
                people at their most modern, at
                their best.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                And she told me about this world
                that she was so attracted to...
                names that didn't mean a thing to
                me...I didn't really hear very
                much of what she was saying.

      We watch them at the table... Benjamin listening,
      appreciating her... her face aglow with the intensity and
      the passion of youth... Caviar is brought over...
      vodka... She screws up her mouth not wanting to eat... We
      can sense he's telling her, what he's learned from
      Elizabeth Abbott, how to savor it... He feeds her a
      spoonful... They drink the vodka washing it down... she
      laughs, delighted... And we now hear what she is
      saying...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY
                        (realizing)
                   Oh my god, I've been just talking
                   about myself...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm enjoying listening...

      She takes out a cigarette... He instinctively looks for
      matches, a man gets there first, lighting her cigarette
      for her... he watches the smoke curl around her...
      appreciating her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I didn't know you smoked...

                                 DAISY
                   I'm old enough. I`m old enough
                   for a lot of things....

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Yes you are...

162   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS PARK - NIGHT                                 162

      We see Benjamin and Daisy, their silhouettes walking
      through the park... She puts her arm around his
      shoulder... being close to him...

                                 DAISY
                   I have to go back tomorrow... I
                   wish I could stay...

      They reach a GAZEBO... Not a soul around... They stand
      for a moment in the silence...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In New York we stay up all
                   night... I eat breakfast in a
                   diner on Houston with red booths
                   and watch the sun come up over the
                   buildings... there's always
                   something to do...

      Which is in stark contrast to Benjamin's life... Daisy,
      takes off her shoes...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Dancers... don't need costumes or
                   scenery.

      And showing him what she's been telling him about, she
      does a dance for him...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

162   CONTINUED:                                                      162

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I could imagine dancing completely
                   naked...

      Daisy, dancing for him... While she dances...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Have you read "D.H. Lawrence," his
                   books were banned... The words are
                   like making love....

      He stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her... she
      moves closer to him... She comes next to him and she
      kisses him... and when he doesn't respond... she tries a
      different tact...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In our group... you have to trust
                   people... not be afraid... Sex...
                   is a big part of it... A lot of
                   the dancers... are lesbians... A
                   woman wanted me to sleep with
                   her....

      He's quiet.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Does that upset you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Which part?

                                 DAISY
                   That someone wanted to sleep with
                   me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   People should want to sleep with
                   you... You're very desirable...

                                 DAISY
                   Let's go back to the house... or
                   get a room somewhere... we can put
                   down your coat...

      She takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the
      park... There's nothing he'd like more... but...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's not that I don't want to... I
                   just can't... not tonight....Its
                   just not...

                              DAISY
                I'm old enough.

      And despite how available she is, how desirable she is...

                              BENJAMIN
                Go back to New York, Daisy... Be
                with the people you are so fond
                of... You can only be young
                once...

                              DAISY
                Do you think you are too old for
                me... I've been with older men...

      And when he still doesn't respond...   Daisy, rejected,
      takes up her shoes... And she starts   off... Benjamin
      coming beside her... but they're not   really walking
      together anymore... and the time for   them, this time, has
      gone away...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                You only get so many chances to be
                with someone... I let her go...
                and I missed it...

163   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT            163

      Daisy, caught in the distant time...

                              DAISY
                You look so handsome in that
                suit... your hair...

      A Nurse looks in...

                              THE NURSE
                They're sayin' the hurricane's
                going to miss us... blow right on

                              CAROLINE
                Oh, that's great.

      The Nurse goes off down the hall, her voice telling
      people the good news...

                   I'll just stay under the blankets
                   with my mother. She said nothing
                   would happen to me.

      She looks at the book.

      Benjamin lying on his bed, his glasses on, reading...
      "D.H. Lawrence"... We see he's squinting... We see his
      POINT OF VIEW, the print, is blurred... He takes off the
      glasses, looks at the print... and it's clear as a
      bell...

      underscore what he's just said, he sees THOMAS BUTTON in
      his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet
      bandaged, standing in the doorway...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Hello, Benjamin... Do you
                   remember me?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Of course, Mr. Button... What
                   happened to you?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   My foot was infected... I'm afraid
                   they had to remove it...
                        (beat, without irony)
                   Welcome home, my friend.

165   INT. DELMONICO'S STEAK HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945         165

      The bar and restaurant crowded with men, many with
      various kinds of handicaps from the war, drinking away
      their demons... And we see Benjamin and Thomas sitting at
      a table... thick steaks, baked potatoes, drinks at their
      elbows...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still drinking Sazerac with
                   whiskey instead of brandy.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I'm a man of habit.

                        (smiles)
                   Are you still visiting the house
                   on Bourbon street?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                        (smiles)
                   Not for a long time.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I told him about my life... about
                   my time at war... and he told me
                   how he had devoted his business to
                   making buttons for the war
                   effort...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   The war has been kind to the
                   button industry... we had gone
                   from making forty thousand buttons
                   a day to making two hundred and
                   fifty thousand... We employed ten
                   times the number of workers... We
                   were operating around the clock...

      And he quiets... the sound of the busy restaurant... And
      after some moments Thomas tells him...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I don't know how much longer I
                   have to live...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry to hear that, Mr.
                   Button.

      And it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire
      truth... but he can't bring himself and instead...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I don't have any people. I keep to
                   myself. I -- I'm frightened. I
                   hope you won't mind... but
                   whenever it's possible... I would
                   enjoy your company...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'll do what I can, Mr. Button.

      They quietly eat.

                     (after a beat)
                Tell me Benjamin, do you know
                anything about buttons?

                              BENJAMIN
                Just what holds my shirt on.

      An old brick building with a painting on its side of a
      woman sewing on a button... "Button's Buttons." A driver
      waits outside of a "town car".

167   INT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945                 167

      We see Thomas unlocking a door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON
                     (has been telling
                      him)
                ... comes from the French,
                "bouton," meaning a bud, or any
                round object...

      They come into a corridor. Thomas unlocking another door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                They were originally decorative,

168   INT. WORK FLOOR, BUTTON FACTORY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT          168

      They walk through the quiet factory...

                              THOMAS BUTTON
                The practice of buttoning
                originated in the 13th century...
                when baggy clothing was replaced
                with more form-fitting clothes...

      Thomas, on his crutches...past the lines of work
      benches... Mannequins in uniforms of the armed
      services... with their various gold and silver buttons...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Button's Buttons has been in our
                family for one hundred and twenty-
                four years. My grandfather was a
                tailor. He had a small shop in
                Richmond. After the Civil War he
                came to New Orleans.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   My father saw the wisdom of making
                   our own buttons. The tailor shop
                   grew to this... And today...
                        (a smile)
                   I can't sew a stitch.

      Benjamin is interested, but the obvious question is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's all very interesting.   But
                   what do you want from me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I said, our family has been in the
                   business for a hundred and twenty-
                   four years.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Our family?

      And it's as if he has opened a flood gate...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   You are my family. Benjamin, you
                   are my son.

      And tears run down his anguished face... Benjamin's
      still...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I am so sorry not to have told you
                   before...

      Benjamin hasn't moved. The words ring in his ears.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   You were born the night the great
                   war ended... Your mother died
                   giving birth to you... I
                   thought... I thought you were a
                   monster... I left you on the back
                   steps of a house... I promised
                   your mother I'd make sure you were
                   safe... I should never have
                   abandoned you...

      Benjamin's dead quiet... He looks at this man, his
      father...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My mother?

                                                                     115.



169   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, THE GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1945       169

      We see Benjamin and Thomas in a hallway leading to the
      kitchen of the large house... The hallway filled with:
      photographs of the Button Family. Thomas pointing out
      relatives... Family photographs...

                               THOMAS BUTTON
                ...A great uncle, from Germany.
                      (and a group picture)
                All of the men in the family at
                the Lake House...
                      (notices the date on
                       it)
                1915, three years before you were
                born.

      A photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair
      on the dock of a lake.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Your grandfather at the summer
                house on Lake Pontchartrain. When
                I was a boy I would love to wake
                up before anybody else and run
                down to the lake to watch the day
                begin. It was as if I was the only
                one alive.

      And they've come to a young Woman's photograph... who
      could only be Benjamin's mother. He stops...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I fell in love with her the first
                time I saw her.
                     (beat)
                Your mother's name was Caroline
                Murphy. She was 20. She worked in
                your grandfather's kitchen...She
                was from Dublin... Her father,
                your maternal grandfather, was a
                chimney sweep... He died in the
                flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline
                came with her mother, two sisters,
                and four brothers in 1903 to live
                in New Orleans.

      They stop at the kitchen door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I would find reasons to go to the
                kitchen... just to look at her...

      He does just that... Looking through the round window
      into the empty kitchen... as if she was there those years
      ago... as if she was still there...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   The happiest day of my life was
                   April 25th, 1918 the day I married
                   your mother.

      They move along the hallway... Benjamin looking at the
      photographs... his bloodlines... After some moments:

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Why didn't you tell me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I made a mistake.

      Benjamin looks at him.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   Come and take your rightful
                   place... with your family... with
                   me...

      When Benjamin doesn't say anything...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   We can catch up for all the lost
                   time...

      And when he still doesn't answer...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I'm planning on leaving everything
                   I have to you...

      His "bribe" strikes a nerve.

                                  BENJAMIN
                   I better go.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Where are you going?

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Home.

      Benjamin turns his back and walks out.

                                                                   117.

      Benjamin standing by the door, Queenie sitting up in her
      bed...

                              QUEENIE
                     (unforgiving,
                      angrily)
                He's what?! All those years he's
                creeping around here, and never
                tells us who he is?!! I thought he
                was just queer or somethin' comin'
                around here... always askin' for
                you... He left us $18 that night
                you was found... Eighteen ratty
                ass dollars and a dirty diaper...!
                Now he wants to be your father? He
                wants you to sit at his side...!
                He wants your forgiveness! I won't
                ever forgive him for any of it...
                God's the only one that can
                forgive him!
                     (finished)
                Now I got to get up early with
                Mrs. Hamilton... or she gonna
                drown...
                     (but not finished)
                ...He thinks he can just show up,
                and everything gonna be fine and
                dandy, everybody gonna be
                friends... He got another thing
                coming...

      And with that she turns over, to go back to sleep,
      Benjamin quietly leaves the room.

171   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - BACK STAIRS, HALLWAY - NIGHT          171

      He climbs the back stairs to his room, as if he's
      carrying a terrible burden... as he comes onto the
      hallway, Mr. Daws is sitting on a bench in the hall...
      Seeing Benjamin...

                              MR. DAWS
                Did I ever tell you I was struck
                by lightning seven different
                times. Once, I was walking my dog
                along a country road.

      And we see just that, when suddenly he's struck by
      lightning. The dog, unharmed, licking his face.

                   line of thought... but you know
                   what... God, for some reason,
                   keeps on sending me a wake-up...
                   It's His way of reminding me I'm
                   lucky to be alive...
                        (a beat, sniffs the
                         air)
                   Storm's comin'.

      And   gets up and pads off into his room. Benjamin, left in
      the   hallway...He goes over to look out the window, like
      the   boy we remember looking out at the street lights...
      the   street...

172   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                172

      We see Benjamin being let in by a Butler into the
      fashionable home.

173   INT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                173

      Benjamin in the dark hallway, quietly walking among the
      photographs of "his" family. He goes up the staircase. He
      goes to his father's room. He quietly opens the door. The
      room's dark, his father asleep. He goes to his father's
      bed. His father's frail figure.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispers)
                   Thomas...

      Thomas awakens...seeing Benjamin...

174   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                174

      We see Benjamin wheeling his father in a wheelchair out
      of the house...And...

175   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - SUNRISE                    175

      The endless lake. And we see Mr. Button's chauffeured car
      driving along the lake.

176   EXT. THE BUTTON SUMMER HOME, LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN - SUNRISE 176

      The car's stopped at a chain across the driveway of an
      old summer home. Benjamin helps to put Thomas into his
      wheelchair. He wheels him up the long drive to the house.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                     119.

176   CONTINUED:                                                     176

      All closed up. Shuttered. There are steps that lead down
      to the lake. He starts to wheel his father down the
      steps. The steps are too steep for the wheelchair.
      Benjamin reaches, picking his father up out of the chair.
      He carries him down the steps, but that too is arduous...

      And he puts his father on his back...His father holding
      onto his son, as Benjamin carries him on his back down
      the steps to the dock. There's an old wooden deck chair.
      He helps his father sit in the chair. And as his father
      sits for the last time, watching the lake...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Thank you, Benjamin.

      Benjamin sitting at a distance behind him...Both of them
      watching the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   You can be mad as a mad dog at the
                   way things went...You can swear,
                   curse the fates, regret everything
                   you ever did... but when it comes
                   to the end... You have to let
                   go...

      And as his father shuts his eyes, sitting in the sun.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   I buried him in the Button family
                   plot.

177   EXT. AN OLD CEMETERY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                  177

      We see Benjamin standing at his father's gravesite in the
      family plot, with ornate headstones...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I had a tailor sew onto his best
                   coat -- a button for every year of
                   his life....fifty-five of them...
                   all different, pearl and silver,
                   brass and wood... in case he lost
                   one along the way...

      And as he stands at the gravesite... He hears something.
      Queenie has come to be with him...to comfort him...

                                 QUEENIE
                        (why she's here)
                   Don't you suffer alone for it.

      She takes his arm, always there for him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                      120.

177   CONTINUED:                                                      177

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (looking around)
                   It's a beautiful cemetery... And
                   buried here right next to your
                   mother.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (looks at her)
                   His wife.

      And as they stand at the gravesite...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I went to pay a visit to the
                   button factory.

178   INT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                    178

      We see Benjamin with an elderly woman, MS. SANDERSON,
      standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory
      work floor... looking down upon the workers, exclusively
      women, and exclusively white women, making buttons...The
      women, seeing him, look up, and there's a sudden hush...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My name is Benjamin, Benjamin...
                        (for the first time)
                   Button...

      They stare up at him...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   As you know, my father...

      It still sounds strange to him.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ...My father, Thomas Button...
                   recently passed...

      After a moment:

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   He asked that I take over the day
                   to day operation of Button's
                   Buttons.

      They silently stare up at him....

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Well, I don't know the first thing
                   about buttons...and I don't know a
                   thing about business...
                                 (MORE)

178   CONTINUED:                                                  178
                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (after a beat)
                   Button's Buttons has been in my
                   father's family for over 100
                   years. It could not have survived
                   without people like you. My father
                   asked me to tell you how much he
                   appreciated the hard work you put
                   in for him and his company for so
                   many years.

      Dead still... And after a moment;

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I have decided that all of you --
                   his loyal employees, will have a
                   share, depending on your length of
                   employment, in the ownership of
                   this factory, his legacy.

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN
                   We're the owners now?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That's about it.

      They're literally dumbfounded.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Mrs. Sanderson will explain how
                   everything works and will answer
                   any of your questions...

      And with that he turns, walking away...Having "given away
      the store"... the workers in disbelief looking up at
      him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I went to New York.

179   EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT, 1947                           179

      We see a cab pull up and Benjamin, in a nice suit,
      flowers in hand, daisies, gets out, hurrying into The
      Majestic Theater, the marquee telling us "CAROUSEL," is
      performing.

180   INT. THE MAJESTIC THEATER, NYC - NIGHT, 1947                180

      Benjamin, coming in late, being shown to his seat. And we
      see the production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical
      "Carousel," with Mielziner's seminal stage design, as
      choreographed by Agnes De Mille... And we see the dancer
      is Daisy...dancing with the man of her dreams, the "bad
      boy" carnival barker... while Benjamin watches her.

                                                                   122.



181   INT. BACKSTAGE, THE MAJESTIC THEATER - NYC - NIGHT, 1947     181

      We see Benjamin, flowers in hand, making his way through
      a crowded backstage corridor filled with friends and well-
      wishers giving cast members congratulations. He comes to
      the door... to the attention of a STAGEHAND...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm a friend of Daisy's...

      The man matter-of-factly opens the door... A dressing
      room crowded with dancers changing out of their
      Costumes... He calls out...

                              THE MAN
                Daisy has company...

      We can hear Daisy's name being said...Benjamin waiting...
      He sees Daisy, in a robe, coming through the room....

                              DAISY
                Somebody's looking for me?...

      ...And she sees it's Benjamin. And rather than excited to
      see him... She's startled he's there... and not
      altogether pleased about him showing up...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Benjamin... What are you doing
                here?

      And he realizes, as most of us have in one love affair or
      another, whatever his expectations may have been, his
      fantasy, is not the reality...

                              BENJAMIN
                I thought I'd come visit... spend
                some time with you if I could...

                              DAISY
                I wish you would have called...
                You caught me by surprise.

      He gives her the flowers, the daisies.

                              BENJAMIN
                I couldn't take my eyes off of
                you... you were mesmerizing...

                              DAISY
                That's so nice of you to say...
                These are lovely... Thank you...


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                      123.

181   CONTINUED:                                                      181

      There's an awkward moment... and...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I better get changed... a group of
                   us are going to a party... would
                   you like to come...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Somebody told me about a
                   restaurant I thought you might
                   enjoy... I made a reservation...
                   Just in case --

                                 DAISY
                        (awkwardly)
                   ...all the dancers go out together
                   after the show... You're welcome
                   to come with us... There'll be all
                   sorts of interesting people... Let
                   me get changed.

      And she runs back inside the dressing room... Benjamin
      left to stand in the hallway....

182   INT. A NEW YORK LOFT - NIGHT, 1947                              182

      A loft elevator opens depositing Benjamin and Daisy along
      with a bunch of people into a large loft... crowded with
      her friends, dancers and show people, musicians,
      predominantly young people, straight and gay, beatniks
      before there were beatniks, bohemians... Music playing...
      People pressed together, having to shout to talk...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I met her friends...

                                 DAISY
                   I'll get you a drink...

      As she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink, she is
      startled as a young man, DAVID, suddenly grabs her,
      kissing her, a kiss that's not intended to be platonic...
      Daisy obviously involved with him... but embarrassed by
      the intimacy in front of Benjamin and not wanting to hurt
      his feelings... she pulls awkwardly away from him...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   This is my friend David... David
                   dances with our company too...
                   This is the man I've told you
                   about, Benjamin...

      They shake hands... Daisy, wanting to escape.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      124.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'll get you that drink. - -

      ...she goes into the kitchen...

                                 DAVID
                   You were her grandmother's friend
                   or something like that...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Something like that.

      And Daisy comes back out with a drink for him... and one
      of her own... But before she can give him his drink, a
      woman takes it from her... and starts to dance with
      her... but not with her... the way dancers do... and many
      of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like
      it... David, comes to dance with Daisy... Benjamin
      standing watching Daisy dancing with him... as only
      dancers can... in complete control of their bodies and
      yet totally uninhibited... Benjamin sees David kiss
      her... and his jealousy getting the best of him, he turns
      and leaves...

183   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              183

      Daisy in her turban... listening to Caroline read..

                                  DAISY
                        (whispers)
                   I knew I'd hurt you... Maybe I
                   intended to...

184   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT, 1947                              184

      Benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the
      street. Daisy running after him...

                                 DAISY
                   I did what you told me to... enjoy
                   my life... I'm only going to be
                   young once... I had no idea you
                   were coming. What did you think I
                   was going to do...? You can't
                   expect me to just drop everything,
                   Benjamin... this is my life...

      And we see DAVID and a group of her dancer friends have

                   There's a party downtown we're
                   going to...

                                 DAISY
                        (conflicted, to
                         Benjamin)
                   Why don't you come with us,
                   Benjamin... There'll be a lot of
                   musicians, interesting people
                   there.... You'll have a good
                   time...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I came here to tell you I made a
                   mistake before...A day doesn't go
                   by that I don't regret it...It's
                   not the way I felt...I should have
                   never let you go...I came because
                   I hoped I could be with you...

                                 DAVID
                   Daisy, you going to come...?

      Cabs have pulled up... She's torn... between her life and
      some other life... Benjamin, recognizing her conflict...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you love him?

185   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              185

      Daisy in bed...

                                 CAROLINE
                   Did you Mother?

      Daisy snaps back to the reality of the room... Starts to
      put the pieces together...

                                 DAISY
                   I think so. I think I do.

      We see the dancers scrambling getting into the taxis...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (understanding)
                   Okay. Okay... I'll see you in New

      He turns to go... she's motionless, caught between the
      two worlds... And we expect her to yell after him, to
      stop him... But instead, she does what we all do in these
      moments, what feels good at the time... She runs to be
      with her friends... She gets into a taxi... The cab
      drives by him as they leave... Daisy turned to look out
      the back window... looking back at him... He waves...
      letting her go... And another chance for them is
      missed... The street's quiet. And hands in his pockets, a
      middle-aged man going on 26... he walks off into the
      night...

                   He came to tell me his father had
                   died.

                                 CAROLINE
                   You couldn't have known.

                                 DAISY
                   I was 23...I just didn't care...

      She's quiet with her thoughts... and, remembering, she
      hums to herself some distant memory of music...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...There are some photographs I
                   think... the zipper part of the
                   large bag...

      Caroline goes to the suitcases... she comes back with a
      manila envelope... Daisy dumps them out...and we see
      they're photographs of Daisy dancing at the height of her
      abilities...

                                 CAROLINE
                   I've never seen these... You never
                   talked about your dancing very
                   much...

      Daisy looks at the photographs...

                                 DAISY
                   I was as good as I was ever going
                   to be. For five years... I danced
                   everywhere... London, Prague,
                   Vienna, and I was the only
                   American invited to dance with the
                   Bolshoi... It was glorious...

                                                                   127.

      And we see Daisy, five years older, her arm inside a tall
      young blond Russian dancer's, ANITOLY, crossing a snowy
      street in Moscow...

                I'd find myself saying...
                     (a beat, saying)
                Goodnight, Daisy.

      And as they both lie in their beds... thinking of the
      other...

      Benjamin in work clothes on a ladder, painting some old

                                 QUEENIE
                   Mrs. La Tourneau just passed away.

      Benjamin nods. Queenie shuts the window.

                   Until one day...

      A Messenger on a bicycle rides up...

                                 A WESTERN UNION MESSENGER
                   I have a telegram for Mr. Benjamin
                   Button...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That would be me....

      He comes down the ladder. The Messenger gives him the
      telegram and getting his tip, rides off, Benjamin opens
      the telegram.

      We see Benjamin coming into the hospital room in
      France...Daisy, fully immobilized, lying in a hospital
      bed...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And her leg was crushed...

      She's still, her eyes closed. Sensing him, she stirs. And
      then she sees him.

                              BENJAMIN
                Hello, Daisy...

                                DAISY
                Who told you?

                              BENJAMIN
                Your friend wired me.

                               DAISY
                That was very kind of you... to
                come all the way here, to see that
                I was alright.

                              BENJAMIN
                You would have done the same for
                me...

      And her first reaction, to how young he is...

                              DAISY
                My God, look at you. You're
                perfect....

      Which she isn't... She's quiet, and she suddenly says:

                   I wish you hadn't. I wish you
                   hadn't come here.

      He's dead still.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I don't want you to see me like
                   this...

      She turns over... as if she didn't see him he wouldn't be
      there... Before he can say anything... A Nurse comes in
      saying something in French... She pulls the curtains
      around the bed... Benjamin waits...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her leg had been broken in five
                   places.... and with therapy, and
                   time, she might be able to
                   stand...maybe even walk...

      The Nurse leaves... Benjamin comes into the circle of
      curtains... It's reminiscent of when they sat under the
      table... the sheets over them... in their private
      world... But this time she lays in the hospital bed her
      back to him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'll get a room... and once you
                   can leave you'll come home with me
                   to New Orleans. Where you can be
                   with people who love you.

      She suddenly turns...

                                 DAISY
                   What home? Who's we? I'm not going
                   back to New Orleans. New Orleans
                   is your home... I don't have a
                   home... I haven't been home for
                   five years... I'm not going
                   anywhere with you...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Alright, I'll stay here in
                   Paris... I'll help you with
                   anything you need...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin...! I know I'm feeling
                   sorry for myself... But it wasn't
                   supposed to be like this...

                 Do you understand, I don't want to
                 be with you... I tried to tell you
                 that in New York... You just don't
                 listen...

                               BENJAMIN
                 You'll change your mind.

                               DAISY
                 We're not little children playing
                 under the table... Remember, when
                 you came to New York. You didn't
                 belong there. I didn't want to be
                 with you then, I don't want to be
                 with you now! I want you to leave!
                 I'm not going anywhere with you! I
                 want you to stay out of my life!

       And she turns away from him again...It's dead still...
       and we look at her staring at the curtains... And after
       some moments she turns back to look at Benjamin... And
       there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze...
       Benjamin is gone...

                 I'll get the nurse...

       She goes into the hall... Daisy left to deal with the
       remnants of her mortality... The Nurse coming into the
       room... Caroline behind her... times her pulse.

                               THE NURSE
                 Let's get you comfortable.

       She raises the morphine level...straightens her
       covers...she stops before she leaves...motions to
       Caroline...Caroline going over to her.

                               THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Pulse rate's slowing...She's
                 getting less oxygen...You'll
                 notice her struggle to
                 breathe...Will you be alright?

       Caroline nods...The Nurse gives her a compassionate look
       and leaves...Caroline stands, her arms protectively
       across her chest, watching her mother...Daisy hums the
       particular ragtime song that Benjamin would play on the
       piano...She opens her eyes, as if not completely sure
       where she is...telling Caroline...

                 People sitting and drinking and

                 thinking about the rest of my
                 life... about people... about
                 home... until I fall asleep.

       She looks at Caroline as if to say, "What happened to

                    I learned to sail on an old boat
                    of my father's from the Lake
                    House...

       And we see Benjamin, the wind in his hair, sailing an old
       sailboat... And the change in his appearance is
       startling... His hair is without a trace of gray... His
       face with barely a wrinkle, chiseled...He is a healthy
       man in his 40s now...

                 ...Or maybe three...

       Benjamin seeing her to the stairs...And as she starts
       down the stairs to leave...we see a cluster of old
       people, ready for the day, looking up at them...the woman
       making her way awkwardly down the stairs and out the
       door...Benjamin gives a little self conscious wave to the
       old timers and starts back into his room...He slows at a
       second story hallway window...looking outside at the
       walkway...the familiar street beyond...If we didn't know
       any better he seems to be waiting for someone to come
       home

       street on his way home... leaves the motorcycle out in
       front...

202    EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962                 202

       He comes to the gate, opening it, coming into the yard,
       shutting the gate behind him, going up the walkway. An
       Old Man is on the porch, quietly rocking. And Queenie,
       for some reason is standing just outside the front door
       on the porch... an apron in her hands... She nods to
       Benjamin... talking to the Old Man in the rocking
       chair... but she seems to be watching Benjamin, as he
       walks around the house -- to the back door. He takes off
       his dirty work boots, leaves them on the porch.

      He hops the back steps, and starts to open the kitchen
      door, when it opens... And DAISY, now 36, but still with
      her unmistakable blue eyes, is standing before him...

                                    BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She came back.

      They look at each other in silence...and they simply
      smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing
      years... They embrace...for some time... and kiss... As
      people who haven't seen each other, and have thought
      about each other... for a very long time... And it just
      is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two
      people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives...
      and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and
      breaks your heart.

203   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962                  203

      A radio plays... they sit at the kitchen table, eating
      dinner... the conversation muted... They don't know
      really where to begin, where did they leave oft...so they
      don't begin until they can....

                                 DAISY
                   Don't you want to know where I've
                   been?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. I don't care where you've been
                   -- I'm just happy you're back.

      And we see Queenie has come into the kitchen... in her
      nightgown now...

                                  QUEENIE
                         (pure Queenie)
                   How come you didn't write or
                   nothin'? Just disappearing like
                   that?

                                 DAISY
                   It was what I needed to do for
                   myself.

                                 QUEENIE
                   I never took you to be selfish. I
                   hope I'm not wrong. I'm not
                   usually wrong about people.

      And Queenie leaves the kitchen...

                                 DAISY
                   She's still taking care of you.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                   139.

203   CONTINUED:                                                   203

      Benjamin slightly smiles. They look at each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're not talking. You haven't
                   said more than two words to me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't want to ruin it...

      And they sit quietly in the kitchen, looking at each
      other, silently eating...

204   INT. BACK STAIRWAY - NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962          204

      Benjamin carries her bags upstairs. They reach the third
      floor.

205   INT. HALLWAY, NOLAN HOUSE - 3RD FLOOR - THAT NIGHT, 1962     205

      All the years seem to surround them. They walk along the
      corridor to Daisy's room. What was her grandmother's
      room. She opens the door.

206   INT. THE BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962             206

      He sets her bags down. Queenie despite her reservations
      has left some clean towels on the bed for her... There's
      an inept quiet. The two of them with nothing left to
      say... And they listen to the quiet... The house with its
      symphony of night noises...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight.

      He is just at the door... when she says...

                                    DAISY
                   Sleep with me.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Are you sure?

                                    DAISY
                   Yes.

      He turns to her. They look at each other. And they kiss,
      A kiss that has waited for thirty years. A kiss that has
      waited a lifetime. And yes, there is passion... and
      need... but most particularly, the awkwardness of people
      discovering each other for the first time... While he
      gently, tenderly, kisses her, undresses her..

                   Are you sure you don't want to
                   know?...

      While they kiss and caress each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I lived in Lyon...

      Benjamin and Daisy undressing one another, touching,
      kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I learned to walk again

      Daisy and Benjamin, naked, passionately kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I worked in a flower shop...

      They lay on the bed, kissing, caressing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I went to American movies a
                   lot.

      They kiss more and more passionately...And Benjamin about
      to make love to her hesitates...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You won't hurt me...

      He kisses her scarred crooked leg. Kisses her body.     And
      as they make love in the old bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I asked her to come with me...

      What follows feels like a HOME MOVIE...without any sound.

207   EXT. THE FLORIDA GULF COAST - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                207

      And we see the small sailboat out on the gulf coast...

                                 BENJAMIN SUTTON'S (V.0,)
                   We sailed into the Gulf... along
                   the Florida coast...

208   EXT. THE FLORIDA COAST, A COVE - DAY, 1963                     208

      Daisy and Benjamin on the sailboat at a cove on the
      Florida coast. They watch a ROCKET, soaring into space
      from Cape Caniveral.

      As they watch it roar overhead, Benjamin marvels at its
      power...leaving its trail across the sky...Daisy, not so
      much interested, taking his arm, taking him back down
      below...

209   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - DAY, 1963                   209

      Daisy washing her hair off the side of the boat.

210   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - NIGHT                       210

      The boat anchored. Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the
      deck having a picnic with just a single lamp for light.

211   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - NIGHT, 1963                 211

      The boat in still another cove. Daisy and Benjamin in
      the water. Just their eyes above the dark water looking
      only at each other.

212   EXT. THE BOAT - CARIBBEAN -    NIGHT, 1963                     212

      Under millions of stars. Benjamin and Daisy making love

      Benjamin and Daisy asleep on a secluded beach.

214   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                         214

      The boat out on the water, Daisy sitting on the deck, the
      wind in her hair... Benjamin at the wheel...threatening
      clouds on the horizon...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I'm so glad we didn't find one
                   another when I was 26... I'm glad
                   we missed...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.0.)
                   Why do you say that?

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   It wasn't right...

215   INT. A CARIBBEAN HOTEL, BAR - DAY, 1963                        215

      A small Caribbean hotel. We see Benjamin and Daisy
      sitting at a table drinking, talking in a nearly empty
      bar... wind and rain lashing the hotel... waiting out a
      tropical storm...

                                 DAISY
                   We wouldn't have this... We
                   wouldn't be here... It happened
                   when it was supposed to happen...

      They look at each other...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Relationships have a time and a
                   place.

                                 DAISY
                   Don't say that.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What I mean is... You don't
                   usually get more than one chance.
                   If you miss it, it's too late...
                   and it's gone... We're lucky... we
                   had more than one chance.

                                 DAISY
                        (laughs)
                   That's easy for you to say...
                   You'll have plenty of chances.

      She tenderly touches his hand... They look at each
      other... And dedicating herself...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm going to enjoy every moment I
                   have with you...

      The waiter's come over.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Have you ever had a Sazerac with
                   whiskey not brandy?

                                 DAISY'S
                        (smiles)
                   I'm with you, aren't I?   I'll try
                   anything.

      And the wind changes direction, the rain coming in
      through the open windows of the bar, getting them wet...
      people run for cover...

                                 DAISY
                   Bet I can stay out here longer
                   than you can.

      And as they both sit doggedly in the rain...

216   INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CARIBBEAN HOTEL - NIGHT, 1963           216

      A white hotel room... The storm shutters closed... The
      wind and the rain banging at the shutters... Daisy and
      Benjamin lying together on a bed out of the storm... She
      touches his face as if for the first time...

                              DAISY
                You barely have a line, a crease,
                or a wrinkle... Everyday I have
                more wrinkles you have less...

      He touches her face.

                              BENJAMIN
                I love your wrinkles.

                              DAISY
                What does it feel like growing
                younger?

                              BENJAMIN
                I don't know... I'm always looking
                out of my own eyes...

      They're quiet, just the sound of the rain and the
      chattering shutters... She lays closer to him...
      warmly... She smiles...

                              DAISY
                Will you still love me when I
                can't stand straight... when my
                skin grows old and spotted...

      Benjamin laughs.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Will you still love me when my
                step gets slow... when I sleep too
                much... when you have to push me
                in a chair...

      And his answer is...

                              BENJAMIN
                Will you still love me when I have
                pimples. When I think it's funny
                to make fart noises...

216   CONTINUED:                                                  216

      She laughs...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Will you still love me when I
                   think all girls have cooties...
                   Will you still love me when I wet
                   my bed at night... Will you still
                   love me when I'm afraid of things
                   that aren't real...

      They hold each other... And Benjamin says... from what
      he's seen...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Nothing lasts...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe some things last...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I've never seen anything not come
                   to an end...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe it's something you can't
                   see...

      And a shutter slams open... the rain and the wind coming
      into the room... Benjamin gets up to close it... He comes
      back into bed... And Daisy, suddenly afraid...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm cold, Benjamin...

      And as he holds her in the white room with the wind and
      the rain trying to get in, banging on the shutters...

217   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT, 1963 217

      The storm's died down... Benjamin and Daisy falling
      asleep...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And you said...

                                 DAISY
                   Goodnight, Benjamin.

                                   BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And I said...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight, Daisy...

                                                                  145.



218   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          218

                              DAISY
                     (that she's stopped)
                Caroline?

                              CAROLINE
                     (after a beat,
                      slightly confused)
                I don't understand. When did you
                meet Dad?

                              DAISY
                Dear Robert... some time after
                that...

                              CAROLINE
                Did you ever tell him about this
                Benjamin?

                              DAISY
                He knew enough. He loved me as I
                was. I loved him for who he was.
                What more was needed?

      She trails off... she's quiet... and wanting to know
      what's next, reading on...

                              CAROLINE
                "That night, in the Caribbean I
                had a visitor..."

219   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT, 1963    219

      Benjamin and Daisy sleeping... the shutters quietly
      talking on a breeze... when one of the shutters SLAMS
      open as if somebody's come in... Benjamin wakes up... And
      he literally sees QUEENIE is sitting on the side of the
      bed beside him...

                              QUEENIE
                I wanted to tell you I love you
                and your mama's gone...

      And she bends, sweetly kissing him...

      And Benjamin rolls over... His eyes come open... Daisy
      sensing he's awake, awakening, murmurs...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                  146.

                                 DAISY
                   Is anything wrong?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Queenie came to tell me she loved
                   me... and that my mother was gone.

                                 DAISY
                   ...go back to sleep...

      As she caresses him... falling back to sleep... the
      shutters talking...

220   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       220

      We see Daisy and Benjamin, with their few belongings,
      returning home... They go up the walkway... Benjamin
      trots up the steps, opens the screen door and goes
      inside...

221   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       221

      Benjamin comes inside... Daisy's just behind him... The
      front room is empty... The house still...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (calls)
                   Hello... Queenie... we're back...

      He looks into the parlor... The piano... He goes down a
      hallway into the kitchen...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Queenie...?   Mama?

      Nobody... He goes down the hall looking in Queenie's
      small room under the stairs... Nobody's there... He moves
      back into the front room... calling...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Hello... Anybody here?

      When finally an old Woman, who's been sleeping, comes out
      of her bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   It's Benjamin, Mrs. Carter...
                   Where is everybody?

                                 THE OLD WOMAN
                   Benjamin... your mother died.

                                                                   147.



222   INT. A BLACK BAPTIST CHURCH, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963         222

      The church crowded... And we see Benjamin and Daisy
      coming in the back as the service is ending... They are
      the only white people there. Benjamin walks to the open
      casket... standing by his mother's side as the choir
      sings a Hallelujah chorus...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We buried her beside her beloved
                Mr. Weathers...

223   EXT. AN OLD NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1963                 223

      A predominantly African-American cemetery... overgrown
      and old... The mourners, almost all of them old white
      people, standing at Queenie's gravesite alongside her
      beloved Mr. Weathers. We see Queenie's daughter among
      the mourners... in her early 30s herself now... And
      Benjamin, standing over his mother's grave... saying his
      goodbyes...

                              BENJAMIN
                We are meant to lose the people we
                love. It's how we know how
                important they are to us.

                              BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                And so we could have memories of
                our own I sold my Father's house
                on Blaine Street...

224   EXT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, GARDEN DISTRICT - DAY, 1963           224

      The old house, in a now decaying New Orleans
      neighborhood... but despite the faltering area, the house
      retains a dignity of its own...

225   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                    225

      We see a young pregnant Woman, a renter, being shown by
      Benjamin along with a Real Estate Agent, around the old
      house.

                              THE WOMAN
                ...It's such a lovely place... You
                must have a lot of fond memories.
                It must be hard for you to give it
                up.

      Benjamin doesn't say anything. There's a knock on the
      door. Benjamin opens it, to let an OLDER MAN in... quite
      a bit older...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                148.

225   CONTINUED:                                                225

                                 THE MAN
                   Is Mrs. Williamson here yet... I'm
                   sorry to be late...

      And he sees his wife... pleased to see her... hugging
      her... tenderly kissing her... and their age difference
      readily obvious... Benjamin acutely aware of it...

                                 THE WOMAN
                   It's a wonderful old place,
                   darling... I think we will be so
                   happy here...

      They go into the hallway lined with the family
      photographs... She's taken by them...

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                   Oh, what a long family history you
                   have...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   They come with the house...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And we bought a house of our
                   own...

226   EXT. A SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963        226

      Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the front steps of a
      suburban New Orleans townhouse, a small screened front
      porch with a tree in front...

227   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT            227

                                 DAISY
                        (murmurs)
                   I loved that house... it smelled
                   like firewood... The chimney
                   leaked smoke... We didn't care...
                   Oh don't stop dear... don't
                   stop...

      She closes her eyes...

                                  CAROLINE'S VOICE (OVER)
                   "It was one of the happiest times
                   of my life..."

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   We had no furniture to speak of...
                   we would have picnics in the
                   living room...

                                                                    149.



228   INT. THE SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963          228

      Benjamin and Daisy having a picnic on the virtually empty
      living room floor.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0,)
                We slept on a mattress...

229   INT. BEDROOM, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS DAY, 1963       229

      We see Benjamin and Daisy sleeping on a mattress on the
      floor in the bedroom...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We vowed never to go to bed or
                wake up at the same time. We
                lived on that mattress...

      And we see just that, a short film of two people who
      can't get enough of each other living on a mattress...
      Daisy and Benjamin at various times, while they are
      either sleeping, or talking, or eating, or reading, or
      making love, ON THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a
                physical therapist...

230   INT. PORCH, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1953       230

      We see Daisy in the screened-in front porch, exercising
      her leg under the supervision of an older woman... MRS.
      VAN DAM...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                We lived four blocks from a public
                pool...

231   INT. A PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL, YWCA - DAY, 1963                 231

      We see Daisy in a bathing suit, resting from swimming,
      holding on to the side of the pool, watching a young,
      well conditioned girl, 18, with nothing but her life
      ahead of her, completely in tune with her body, swimming
      laps... And as it comes to all of us, painfully aware of
      the years passing, her own physical mortality, she starts
      to cry... And we see that Benjamin, come to meet her, is
      standing above her.

                              BENJAMIN
                You're crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                      150.

231   CONTINUED:                                                      231

                                 DAISY
                   It's just the chlorine...

      Looking at the young girl... looking at her...
      understanding...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You chose something to do...
                   something so special... so
                   unique... there was such a short
                   period of time that you could do
                   it... Even if nothing had happened
                   ... Sooner or later you would be
                   in the same place you are now...

      She's quiet... she knows what he's saying is true...

                                 DAISY
                   I don't like getting old.

232   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - DAYBREAK, 1964             232

      Benjamin, Daisy holding onto him, riding the old
      motorcycle along the lake...

233   EXT. THE DOCK AT THE LAKE - DAYBREAK, 1964                      233

      Daisy sits in the familiar deck chair his father had sat
      in looking out at the lake... Benjamin brings her a cup
      of coffee... He sits on the deck on his heels beside
      her...

                                 DAISY
                   I promise you, I'll never lose
                   myself to self-pity again...

      And as they watch the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I think, right there and then,
                   she realized none of us is perfect
                   forever.

234   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          234

      The window has started to rattle again... the wind
      knocking.

                                 CAROLINE
                   I thought the wind had shifted
                   away...

234   CONTINUED:                                                     234

      Daisy doesn't say anything, lying still, staring off...
      her breathing shallow, laboring...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Mother?

                                 DAISY
                        (agitated)
                   I don't remember if I turned the
                   lights off. Did I leave the
                   heater on?

      The Nurse, on her way by, seeing her distress... coming
      in...

                                 THE NURSE
                   Let's get you comfortable...

      She gently covers her... Daisy quietly lies back...

                                 THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                   She's getting ready to leave...

      She looks at Caroline and turns and leaves the room.
      Caroline quietly looks at her mother. Their eyes meet.

                                 DAISY
                   You have the most beautiful eyes.

      Caroline reaches to hold her thin hand. Daisy says
      something to herself. Caroline looks at her...she looks
      down at the book...

                                 CAROLINE
                   He said, "She found peace."

                                 DAISY
                        (says to herself)
                   Peace.

235   INT. A DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1967                   235

      A small dance studio... a scratchy phonograph record
      playing music... young girls learning how to dance...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She opened a dance studio...

      And we see Daisy, in a long skirt over a long sleeved
      leotard... wearing slippers...

      The first time we've seen her dressed like this in many a
      year... happily teaching young girls how to dance...

236   INT. DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1967                    236

      We see Daisy alone... cleaning up... music playing on the
      record player... and for a brief moment she stops, and
      dances... the smallest, most tentative of steps... she
      sees in the studio's mirrors Benjamin's been silently
      watching her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still beautiful to watch...

      She looks at herself in the dance mirror... just what
      happens...

                                 DAISY
                   Dancing is all about the line...
                   the line of your body...after
                   awhile... you lose the line... and
                   you can never get it back...

      They look at each other in the mirror...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I figured out if you were born in
                   1918... 49 years ago... I'm 43...
                   we're almost the same age... In
                   three years we'll meet in the
                   middle...

      And what she doesn't say, what they both know, is she's
      going one way and he's going the other...Benjamin
      affectionately...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (smiles)
                   We finally caught up to each
                   other...

      She smiles, starts to turn...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Stay just like that... I want to
                   remember what we look like right
                   now.

      They stay like that for a moment longer... She turns to
      get her things... She shuts off the lights... She takes
      his arm...

                   I thought I was far too old... I'm
                   pregnant...

      He stops... They look at each other, she smiles, nodding
      "yes," it's true. And deeply moved he takes her in his
      arms... grateful...touching her face... holding her...

      We're not sure what more she is about to say, her

      breathing...

      As they ride Benjamin looks over watching a father

      Daisy with a hot Fudge sundae and a tuna sandwich...
      Benjamin just some coffee... They're quiet... And Daisy

                              DAISY
                I know you're afraid.

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm not hiding it.

                               DAISY
                Okay.   What's your worst fear?

                              BENJAMIN
                What if it has...what if its like

                              DAISY
                Then we'll love it all the more...

                              BENJAMIN
                I want to be father... not a
                little brother... I don't want to
                be picked up from elementary
                school by my kid... I don't want
                anyone babysitting me...

                I'm going to make this work...
                This is what I want, and I want it

                You know, there's nothing I

                Would you tell a blind man he
                can't have children? You will be
                a father for as long as you can.
                I know the consequences. I
                accepted that. Your love, loving
                you, is worth everything to me.

      He smiles... She gets up and goes to the restroom. He
      sits with his thoughts... and he notices a television's
      on... a news report... something catches his eye...
      someone swimming? He gets up moving to the television...
      where he hears...

                                 A MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

                   The oldest woman to ever swim the
                   English Channel arrived in Calais
                   today... having made the swim in
                   thirty-four hours, twenty-two

                   the sixty-eight year old

      And we see dear ELIZABETH ABBOTT, coming out of the

                        (on television)
                   Anything's possible.

      And as she smiles, after a lifetime of waiting,
      triumphant... And Benjamin smiles for her, and for
      himself, too... where anything is possible... Daisy's
      come beside him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Yes.

      He leaves some money. He takes her arm... and as they go
      outside, moving along the street...

       mirror... his 51st year on this earth... 34 years old...
       a young man... He looks at his baby... he looks at
       Daisy... in her mid 40s... her hair's begun to gray...
       her face begun to show the natural touches of age... His
       stare awakens her... She looks at him sensing he's deeply
       troubled... He shuts his eyes... she watches him sleep,
       Daisy as troubled as he is... but for very different
       reasons...

246    EXT. A PARK - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969                        246

       Benjamin is sitting with Caroline while she plays in a
       park's sand box... Caroline helping herself to a mouthful
       of sand... Benjamin, trying to get the sand out of her
       mouth...

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Don't eat sand...

       Daisy comes over to sit with them...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                    She's going to have a really
                    attractive diaper.

       As they sit watching Caroline playing in the sand...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I think you should find a real
                   father for her...

                                 DAISY
                   What are you talking about?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs someone to grow old
                   with...

                                 DAISY
                   She'll learn to accept whatever
                   happens... She loves you...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs a father not a playmate.

                                 DAISY
                   Is it that my age is starting to
                   show...? Is that what you are
                   telling me? Have you lost your
                   desire for me...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You don't need another child to
                   raise...

                                 DAISY
                   You're going to leave me, aren't
                   you?

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't leave me.

      He's silent.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't do this to me...!

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was your first birthday. We
                   had a party... the house was
                   filled with people...

                                                                   159.



247    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969           247

       The birthday party. A cake with a big number "1" candle.
       One-year-olds not having a clue.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                 The fathers and mothers were
                 there...

       He looks at the age appropriate mothers and fathers with
       their children...

                               A MAN
                 Before you look around they'll be
                 in High School dating.

       Benjamin manages a smile.

247A   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY - PRESENT         247A

                               DAISY
                 I remember your first birthday
                 like it was yesterday.

248    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATER IN THE DAY, 1969            248

       The house is empty, the guests gone... Daisy busy
       cleaning up from the party. She stops to look outside,
       at the backyard. Benjamin is sitting on a lounge
       chair... the baby, in her party dress, sitting on his
       chest... As Daisy stands at the window watching him with
       their baby...

249    INT. THEIR BEDROOM - SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT,    249
       1969

       Benjamin, dressed, watching Caroline in her crib, asleep.
       Daisy in bed, asleep.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                 I sold the summer house on Lake
                 Pontchartrain... I sold my share
                 of Button's Buttons... I sold the
                 sailboat... I put it all into an
                 account for your mother... And
                 before you would ever remember
                 me...

       And he bends to kiss his sleeping daughter, whispering to
       her...

                               BENJAMIN
                 I want you to know I love you...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      160.

      He stops to put a bank book on the dresser, along with a
      house key... the sound of the key is just enough for
      Daisy to stir. He starts to leave... He turns to go...
      and he sees Daisy is looking at him... A look not so much
      of anger, or hurt, not of resignation, but a look of
      acceptance... that this is what her life is now... He
      crosses out of the dark room silently closing the door
      behind him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I left, so that you and your
                   mother could have a life.

250   EXT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1969              250

      He takes the old motorcycle out of the garage.

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                         (after a beat)
                   I left with just the clothes on my
                   back.

      He starts the motorcycle, and with just the shirt on his
      back he rides away...

251   INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT,           251
      1969

      Daisy still lying in bed, the sound of the motorcycle
      driving away. She gets up. She takes the baby out of
      her crib and into bed with her, holding her baby in the
      bare light...

252   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              252

      Daisy, in her regal turban, silently looking out the
      window... the wind knocking loudly again...

                                  CAROLINE
                   I almost wish I didn't know any of
                   this.
                         (she's quiet, after a
                          beat)
                   I feel odd, reading...it...

      She looks at the book...

                   Where did he go?

                                   DAISY
                   I don't know.    I never heard from
                   him.

      Caroline, distant, picks through the book...She comes
      upon...

                                 CAROLINE
                   There are postcards...

      Looking through them...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   They're all addressed to me...
                   They're from all sorts of
                   places...

      And she realizes...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   They're for my birthday.

                   1970...I would have been two...
                   "Happy Birthday." "I wish I could
                   have kissed you goodnight."
                        (reading, another
                         one)
                   "Happy Birthday, you're five." "I

                        (reading on)
                   "Happy Birthday six-year-old." "I
                   wish I could be there to teach you

                   "1983." I was fifteen. "I wish I

                   Nothing I ever did will replace
                   that..."

      Daisy murmurs... Which brings Caroline back to the
      book...

       And Benjamin's voice comes in... WHILE WE SEE HIM IN
       VARIOUS PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD, A MONTAGE, A FILM
       WITHIN A FILM, OF THE ROAD HE'S TAKEN...

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                 "...What I think is, it's never
                 too late...or, in my case, too
                 early, to be whoever you want to
                 be...There's no time limit, start
                 anytime you want...change or stay
                 the same...there aren't any
                 rules...We can make the best or
                 worst of it...I hope you make the
                 best...I hope you see things that
                 startle you. Feel things you
                 never felt before. I hope you
                 meet people who have a different
                 point of view. I hope you
                 challenge yourself. I hope you
                 stumble, and pick yourself up. I
                 hope you live the life you wanted
                 to...and if you haven't, I hope
                 you start all over again."

       When we come out of those images...

       A record's playing piano music. Classes are done.
       Parents taking their children. We see Daisy, in her long
       skirt... helping pick up with her hands and her nimble
       toes, errant clothing, the jackets, the sweaters...

      It takes us a moment to recognize her... in the some
      twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her
      hair's cut short... and it's gone mostly gray... and,
      although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's
      posture, her head held high... carrying herself with
      grace... and one thing that will never change, are her
      unforgettable blue eyes... We hear the door opening...
      Daisy, busy gathering, saying her goodnights... glances
      toward the door across the studio... And she sees a young
      Man has come in, a young man in his twenties... standing
      silently, a stranger, standing by the door... Daisy, as
      she closes up the studio, makes her way toward him,
      saying goodnight to people... she bends to pick up a
      ballet slipper...

                                 DAISY
                   Somebody left their slipper...

      Daisy looks over, the young Man hasn't moved... the
      studio has all but emptied... she walks toward him...
      he's wearing worn trousers, a coat that's seen better
      days...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you here to pick someone up?

      He shakes "no." Coming closer....

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm sorry, we're closed now.

      She moves to open the door to show him out... when she
      gets a good look at him. She stops, realizing who it
      is...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin?

      ...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are...
      sixteen years younger... in his 20s now... it's at once
      staggering and heartbreaking... what age can do... And
      she realizes, at that very moment, he was right all
      along...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're so young.

      They look at each other... When she's able to find the
      words...

                I wanted to see you both.

      She stares at him... just the piano music. And despite
      the gulf of time... there's a terrible aching they have
      for each other... and before they can say anything... the
      door swings open and Caroline, 12, comes hurrying in...

                              CAROLINE
                You ready, Mom?

      Benjamin stares at her appearance... And Daisy, can't
      help herself, and seeing Caroline, Daisy, overcome by it
      all, starts to cry.

                              CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                Is something wrong, Mother?

                              DAISY
                No... He was telling me a very sad
                story about a mutual friend we
                hadn't seen in a long time... This
                is my friend, Benjamin... you knew
                him when you were... just a
                baby...

                              CAROLINE
                Hi...

                              BENJAMIN
                Hello...

      He reaches, taking her hand... needing to touch her...

                              A MAN'S    (V.O.)
                Hello...

      And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in...

                              THE MAN
                I'm sorry... I thought you were
                done...

                              DAISY
                This is a friend of my family's...
                Benjamin Button... this is my
                husband... Robert...

      They shake hands... There's an awkward quiet...

                              ROBERT
                It was nice to have met you...
                We'll be in the car, darling...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                              DAISY
                I'm just closing up...

      And Robert and Caroline go outside to wait for her...

                              BENJAMIN
                She's so lovely... she looks like
                you... Does she dance?

                                 DAISY
                Not very well.

                              BENJAMIN
                I suppose that would be from my
                side of things.

                              `DAISY
                She's a dear sweet girl... she
                seems a little lost... But who
                isn't a little lost at 12?
                There's a lot of her that reminds
                me of you.

      And she shuts off a set of the lights.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                My husband. He's a doctor... was
                a widower... He's an incredibly
                bright, adventurous man...

      Benjamin smiles.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                He's been a terrific father... and
                a great partner and friend...

      And she shuts off the record player and another set of
      lights... and for a moment they stand in the dark
      studio... and they look at their reflections in the
      mirror... seeing who they are now...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                You're so much younger.

                              BENJAMIN
                Just what you can see.

      She looks at him, and after all these years... she now
      understands completely... she looks outside at her
      daughter standing by the car with her "father,"
      waiting...

                               DAISY
                 You ware right. She needed a
                 father. I couldn't have raised
                 both of you. I'm not that strong.

      He's quiet.   They both are.   She looks at him.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 I never thought how it must have
                 broken your heart, too.

      His silence is enough.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 Where are you staying? What are
                 you going to do?

                               BENJAMIN
                 I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on
                 the avenue. I have no idea what
                 I'm going to do.

      And it seems like they want to hold each other. But they
      can't. It's still. And aware of the car's headlights
      waiting at the curb... she turns, holding the door open
      for him...

                                 DAISY
                 I have to go.

      He nods.   He walks by her, going out.

264   EXT. A STREET, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980                         264

      She stops to lock the door. She turns, getting into the
      car... and leaves... Benjamin stands on the corner, hands
      in his pockets, the car driving by him... and Daisy can't
      help but look at him... and then the car's gone... and as
      he crosses the street and walks off into the night...

265   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT               265

                 That young man was my father?

      And a Nurse comes in.

                               THE NURSE
                 The hurricane changed directions
                 again. They are predicting it
                 will make landfall sometime soon.

                                 CAROLINE
                   Is there anything we need to do?

                                 THE NURSE
                   Arrangements are being made to
                   move people if we have to. I'll
                   let you know as soon as we know
                   anything.

      She leaves hurriedly.

                                 DAISY
                   Please tell me what he says?

      Caroline looks at the book.       And Benjamin's voice comes
      in...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   "That night..."

266   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980            266

      Benjamin, sitting on the end of the bed, not sure why he
      came there at all... There's a sound at the door...as if
      somebody was there...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Hello?

      Its quiet...a hesitancy...He starts to get up and there's
      a knock on the door...He opens it...and Daisy's there.
      He's startled to see her...

                                    DAISY
                   May I come in?

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Please...

      She comes inside...an awkward quiet...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I don't know what I'm doing
                   here...What I expected...?

      It echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not
      knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly...

                                    DAISY
                   Nothing lasts.

      He puts a finger to her lips. He shakes "no."       And what
      he's come to know, that some things do last...

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I never once stopped loving you...

      He affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead...

                                 DAISY
                   I'm an old woman now, Benjamin.

      And he helps her off with her coat... She's still.

                                   DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin...

      He kisses her... and she's quiet... and he undresses
      her... undressing himself... and they stand momentarily
      naked... the young man and the older woman.

                                   DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Some things you don't ever
                   forget... the feel... the taste...

      And he kisses her again...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ... the smell...

      He puts his mouth by her cheek... breathing her in...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ... the touch...

      Caressing her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Of someone you love...

267   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980           267

      We see Benjamin standing at the window watching as Daisy
      gets into a taxi... the taxi starting to drive off... and
      Daisy turning... to look back... waving to him. Benjamin
      waving to her... what they both somehow know, is a last
      goodbye...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I watched her go...

      ...the taxi going down the street and out of sight... for
      the last time... Despite losing sight of her he still
      hasn't moved... standing by the window...

268   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT             268

      Daisy, breath raspy, sitting silently in her bed looking
      out the window... We realize Caroline's stopped
      reading...

                                    DAISY
                   Please read...

                                 CAROLINE
                   That's the last thing he wrote...

      Daisy's quiet... they both are... alone with their
      thoughts...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   What happened to him after that
                   last time with you, Mother?

      The wind has picked up considerably, rattling the window
      even harder..

                   A year or so after your father
                   passed... There was a call...

269   INT. DAISY'S HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990               269

      And we see Daisy in her bathrobe, in her sixties...
      drinking a cup of coffee... the telephone rings...

270   INT. A TAXI, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990                       270

      We see Daisy riding in the back or a taxi.

                                 DAISY
                   It's the last house...

      She looks outside, and we see up ahead of her, the Nolan
      House standing like a monument to time...

271   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE - DAY, 1990                             271

      Daisy gets out. The taxi drives off. Daisy stops for a
      moment before she opens the gate. The house has fallen
      into disrepair. A solitary old man sits on the porch
      rocking and rocking. She goes up the walk and out of
      habit goes around the back porch... to the kitchen...
      going inside...

272   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 1990                               272

      She comes into the kitchen. She moves down the hallway
      into the living room... The interior has also fallen on
      hard times. Some old people are still in residence --
      predominantly African Americans now... Queenie's
      daughter, now in her fifties herself, stands in the
      living room... Along with a plain Man in a plain suit...

                                  DAISY
                   I'm Daisy...

      The Man turns...

                                 THE MAN
                   Thank you for coming... I'm David

                   department of Child Welfare
                   Services.

      Queenie's daughter turns on a lamp... it doesn't work...
      she crosses the room to turn on another...

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   He was found living in a condemned
                   building off of east Lamont... the
                   police found this with him... this
                   address... and your name...

      And he gives her the journal...

                   He was in very poor health... he
                   was taken to the hospital... He
                   doesn't seem to know who or where
                   he is... He's very confused... The
                   doctors who looked at him think he
                   may be autistic.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   I told Mr. Hernandez about
                   Benjamin bein' one of us. I told
                   him if he needs a place to stay...
                   it's alright... he can stay
                   here... he is blood after all...

      And just then we hear a PIANO playing... as if it were
      being played by a child... with no skill... banging as
      much as anything... And Daisy follows the sound of the
      piano into the parlor...

273   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1990                            273

      And she sees his back... just a boy of 12 now... hunched
      over... trying to play the piano... trying to play the
      tune the woman had taught to him...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin.

      He turns at the sound of her voice. There is no
      indication he recognizes her at all.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Do you know this song?

      And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is
      nothing more than a child playing random notes.

                                 DAISY
                   You play really beautifully.

      She comes and touches his back... He shrinks from her
      touch.

                                 THE MAN
                   He doesn't seem to like to be
                   touched.

      And while he tries to play...

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   The doctors said if they didn't
                   know any better, he goes in and
                   out of states of recognition, as
                   if he had the beginnings of
                   dementia...

      Daisy's looking at the boy, who was once the man she
      loved... who she still loves... She looks into his
      eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   Do you remember me?   I'm Daisy.

      He looks at her.    No sense of recognition.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Daisy is a very pretty name. I'm
                   Benjamin.

                                 DAISY
                   It's good to meet you Benjamin.
                   Do you mind if I sit with you? I
                   would love to hear you play.

      He doesn't say anything. She sits down beside him on the
      piano bench. He stops to look at her.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   There's something about you...
                   There's something about your eyes
                   I remember from a long time ago...

      He looks at her eyes. She looks at him... And as she
      sits with him on the piano bench... as he tries to
      play... Daisy and Benjamin, "together again..."

274   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              274

                                 DAISY
                   Queenie's daughter saw to it that
                   he was taken care of...

275   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1994                   275

      And we see Benjamin, just eight now... coming into the
      kitchen... Queenie's daughter cleaning up after
      breakfast.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   I want some breakfast.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                       175.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   You just ate breakfast.

                                    BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   No I didn't...

                                 AN OLD WOMAN
                   You just finished eating, Mr.
                   Button.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   You think I don't know what you
                   are doing?

      And like an eight year old, or an old man old with onset
      Alzheimer's -- which makes him nearly a helpless child,
      he starts to rage... throwing things...

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT (CONT'D)
                   You are all fucking liars!

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   And every day I would stop by...
                   and make sure he was
                   comfortable...

      And just then Daisy comes into the kitchen.       She sees him
      raging.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   He doesn't believe he's already
                   had his breakfast.

                                 DAISY
                   Let's see if we can find something
                   else for you to do.

                                  BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                         (upset, meaning
                          lapses)
                   I can't help it. I can't help
                   this.

                                 DAISY
                   I know you can't.

      And as she puts her arm around him, taking him out of the
      room, understanding...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   Many times he would simply forget
                   who and where he was at all...

                                                                   176.



276   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY                      276

      We see Daisy sitting on a bed with Benjamin in his room
      on the second floor of the old house... And he's oddly
      lucid...more articulate than his age would indicate...

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                I get the feeling there's a lot of
                things I can't remember...

                              DAISY
                What do you mean?

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                It's like there's this whole life
                I had and I can't remember what it
                was...

      He's frustrated by it...

                              DAISY
                It's alright... It's alright to
                forget things...

      And as she sits on his bed with him... in the upstairs
      room...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                It wasn't easy...

277   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1996                                 277

      And we see Benjamin, no more than six now, standing on
      the ROOF... Daisy standing on the ground down below
      him...

                              DAISY
                     (nervous)
                I wish you'd come down...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX
                     (a little boy)
                I can see everything.

      And he points out...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D)
                I can see the big river... all the
                boats... I can see the graveyard
                where mama's buried and all those
                other people... I can see the
                city... where you have your
                dancing place...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      177.

277   CONTINUED:                                                      277

      And tears fill Daisy's eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   You're right, you can see
                   everything sweetheart...

      And he can... he can see all the way across to the
      Mississippi River... the old graveyard... the city... his
      whole life...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I think you better come down...

                                 BENJAMIN AT SIX
                   What if I could fly?

      And it looks like he might just try...

                                 DAISY
                        (stopping him)
                   I knew a man who could fly. Come
                   down and I'll tell you all about
                   him.

      He's quiet, thinking about that. And acquiescing, he
      turns up the roof out of sight... some short
      moments...and he comes running out the front door... his
      hands in his pockets like the brave little man he is...
      Daisy bends down... and as he runs into her arms... Daisy
      holding him...

278   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              278

      Daisy propped in her bed looking out the window...

                                 DAISY
                   And I went to take care of him...

279   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1997                                    279

      And we see Daisy, in her seventies now, carrying a
      suitcase, coming up the walkway, and onto the porch...
      old people sitting in the porch chairs...

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   He was five, I think, when I moved
                   in... the same age I was when I
                   had met him...

      And we see Benjamin, 5 now, sitting on the porch swing,
      staring off... and he drools like a helpless old man.
      Daisy stops, taking out a handkerchief, wiping the drool
      off his chin...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                   How would you like to help me
                   unpack?

280   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1997                   280

      Daisy, unpacking her suitcase with Benjamin's help,
      taking out an alarm clock, a quilt, some photographs...
      The "Just So Book.." Her personal things... moving in...
      Benjamin, playing with the alarm clock, making the alarm
      go off... again, and again...

281   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1997                 281

      Benjamin in a small child's bed. Daisy, sitting on his
      bed reading from Kipling's "Just So" stories to him...

                                 DAISY
                   This is the picture of old Man
                   Kangaroo at five in the afternoon,
                   when he got his beautiful hind
                   legs just as Big God Ngong had
                   promised.

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)

282   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, THE FALL, 2000                  282

      And we see Benjamin, just three or so now, holding
      Daisy's hand, walking with her in some autumn leaves...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I watched as he forgot how to
                   talk...

283   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 2001                            283

      Benjamin almost two... sitting On Daisy's lap in the
      front room... and saying...

      Proud of himself he smiles...

      clock of "Mr. Cake's"... handing it down to another
      workman...and putting up a new clock... a digital
      clock... The time moving... the way it's meant to be...
      going forward...

      Shadows dapple the room. Daisy sitting in    an old chair
      in the middle of the room... with daylight   streaming in
      on her... holding Benjamin on her lap... a   tiny thing
      now... nearly newborn... he can almost fit   in her two old
      hands...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                He looked at me...

                   person behind his eyes... and, at
                   that moment I knew... he knew who

      And we see his eyes flutter and softly close... forever.
      And as he lays in his beloved Daisy's lap... completely
      still...

289   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              289

      The wind a full out hurricane.    The lights flicker.   Stay
      on.

                                 CAROLINE
                   I'm going to see what they want us
                   to do...

      And as she gets up, the "book" drops on the floor.      And a
      card's fallen out. Caroline picks it up.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   It's a train schedule.

      She turns it over.    There's writing.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   "I'm on a train in India filled
                   with people."

290   INT. A TRAIN SOMEWHERE IN INDIA - LATE AT NIGHT                 290

      An overcrowded train car... people sitting and standing
      and lying on the seats and on the floor, in every
      available space, nook and cranny, asleep.

      Now we see Benjamin sitting on the floor among all of the
      people, the only one awake, writing on the back of the
      train schedule.

      howling, hurricane... a hundred mile an hour fury... And
      fighting against the wind, trying to reach the window is
      a hummingbird... it almost makes it and is pushed back by
      the gale... but undaunted, its wings doing a figure
      eight... the symbol for infinity... it fights its way
      through the wind to the window... tapping at the
      window... and the hummingbird flies away... she watches
      it go... and after some moments she says...

DOGMA

EXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAY

Jersey spring day. Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier,
the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline.

An OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away from
besmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat.
His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrises
than one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small,
satisfied smile cross his face.

Behind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the
boardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing a
street hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views them
briefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean.

The skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up to
their faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod.

Their skates glide out of frame.

P.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach.
We get closer and closer to him until...

One of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhales
violently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagely
beating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them.
Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head.

OC VOICE

I don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on the
writings Lewis Caroll?

The three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse.
Satisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk.

INT AIRPORT - DAY

LOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through the
metal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can.

LOKI

Leaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the Looking
Glass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the
metaphorical meaning?

NUN

I wasn't aware there was one.

                                   LOKI

Oh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized
religion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers to
either the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god,
Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an
obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a
carpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what do
they do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the
oysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and
devour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says to
you, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological
figures insures the destruction of one's inner-being.

BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats
popcorn and stares at...

A steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family.

                                  OC LOKI

Organized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our
actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes
a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says "No, no!"

Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him,
kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun.

                                   LOKI

'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale? I think not.

                                    NUN

(really dazed)

I've... I've never really thought about it like that...

(beat; shocked; off her cassock)

What have I been doing with my life...?'.

                                   LOKI

Don't look back. Just get out there and taste life.

(off donation can)

Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible - it's
another way the church is trying to control you. You take that money you've
been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice
piece of ass. You deserve it.

The Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something.
A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki
faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the
still-transfixed Bartleby.

                                 BARTLEBY

                               (looking OC)

Here's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God.
You've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I just
heard you claim to be an atheist.

                                   LOKI

C'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that shit I was telling her. I
just like to fuck with the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her head
stops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the Just again. But oh. will
she have a bunch to confess.

(looks around)

Now here's what I don't get about you: why do you feel the need to come
here all the time?

                                 BARTLEBY

(off travelers)

I like to watch. This is humanity at it's best. Look at them.

A reunited FAMILY share a group hug and move on, making way for two young
LOVERS to embrace and kiss passionately.

                                OC BARTLEBY

All that tension, all that anger and mistrust, forgotten for one perfect
moment when they come off that plane. See those two? The guy doesn't even
know that the girl cheated on him while he was away.

OC LOKI

She did?

Bartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals.

                                 BARTLEBY

Uh-huh. Twice. But it doesn't matter at this moment because they're both so
relieved to be with one another. I like that. I just wish they could all
feel that way more offen.

                                   LOKI

Maybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would. Now
what was so friggin' important that I had to miss cartoons this morning? If
it was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments, I'm
going to slug you.

                                 BARTLEBY

(still looking OC)

You're never going to believe this: we're going home.

                                   LOKI

(off Bartleby's popcorn)

Let me have some?

                                 BARTLEBY

(pulls out envelope)

Look what somebody sent us in the mail.

(hands him a newspaper article and corn)

                                   LOKI

Did you say we're going home?

(reads)

"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on 'Catholicism - Wow!"

Campaign."

(to Bartleby)

And?

BARTLEBY

Keep reading.

                                   LOKI

(reads)

"Updating the church... television spots... Papal consent...
rededication...

(to Bartleby)

Again - and?

                                 BARTLEBY

(snatches article) Give me this

(getting up; reading)

"The Re-dedication of Saint Michael's Church on it's hundredth anniversary
is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Church
back into the mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance to
the centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of
pleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all who
pass through it's arches a morally clean slate."

(looks at Loki)

You still don't get it, do you?

                                   LOKI

No, I don't get it. Are we leaving now?

They start walking.

                                 BARTLEBY

If you walk through the church's front door on the day of the Re-dedication
ceremony, your soul is wiped clean of any and all existing sin, moreso than
the sacrament of penance could ever offer. It's a plenary indulgence, man!
I don't know why I never thought of this before.

                                   LOKI

(spits out chewed popcorn into trash can)

Sounds thin. Sounds like someone made it up.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's rarely employed, but it's legitimate. It has a papal sanction for
God's sake.

                                   LOKI

So you're saying you and I can walk through this doorway and go back home?

                                 BARTLEBY

No - by passing through the doors, our sins are

forgiven. Then all we have to do is die...

                                   LOKI

Wait. wait, wait - Die? I don't want to die.

(chews popcorn)

                                 BARTLEBY

(steps on conveyor belt)

You'd rather stay down here for a few more eons?

                                   LOKI

No, but we don't even know if we can die. And what if we can, but this
archway thing doesn't pan out? What then? Hell? Fuck that.

(spits out chewed popcorn into napkin)

                                 BARTLEBY

Impossible. If we cut off our wings and transubstantiate to complete human
form then we become mortal. And if we die with clean souls, there's no way
to keep us out. They have to let us in.

LOKI

(beat)

Who sent this thing?

                                 BARTLEBY

I don't know. Somebody who's looking out for us,

I guess. Does it matter? All that matters is that

after all these years, we've found a loophole. He

can't keep us out anymore. And once we're back

in, I'm sure He'll just forgive and forget.

They pass the Nun. who leans against a wall, still dazed.

                                   LOKI

Yeah, but this plenary' indulgence thing is a church law, not Divine
Mandate. Church laws are fallible because they're created by man.

                                 BARTLEBY

One of the last sacred promises imparted to Peter the first Pope by the Son
of God before He left was "Whatever you hold true on earth..."

                                   LOKI

" ...I'll hold true in Heaven."

                                 BARTLEBY

So if the Pope says it's so, God must adhere. It's dogmatic law.

                                   LOKI

(beat; extends hand)

Let it never be said that your anal retentive attention to detail never
yielded positive results.

                                 BARTLEBY

(accepts hand)

You can't be anal retentive if you don't have an anus.

                                   LOKI

There's just one thing I think I should do before we leave - something
that'Il get us back on His good side.

BARTLEBY

What's that?

Loki smiles and starts rifling through his pockets. He extracts a magazine
article.

                                   LOKI

This is something I've been dreaming about for five years now. Read.

The crumpled article displays a Barney-like gold-hued cow, alongside
various profit charts and text.

                                OC BARTLEBY

                                 (reading)

"Mooby the Golden Calf- Creating an Empire Out of Simplicity."

Loki wipes his mouth and nods to the article.

LOKI

I want to hit them.

                                 BARTLEBY

Are you nuts?!

(crumples article)

We're mere days away from getting back, and you want to jeopardize it
because you have a soft spot for the good ol' days?!

                                   LOKI

What better way to show I've repented than by resuming the position I
denied... thanks to you.

                                 BARTLEBY

A killing spree is not going to make things better for us.

                                   LOKI

We're not talking about killing here. We're talking about Divine Justice.
We're talking about punishing the wicked, raining down fire and brimstone.
He's all about that. I just know he'd want this done.

                                 BARTLEBY

There hasn't been an Angel of Death since you quit. Doesn't that mean
anything to you? Besides, what if you're wrong?

                                   LOKI

If I'm wrong, it won't matter. Like you said - we pass through the arch and
we're forgiven anyway

They step up to an elevator and press the button.

                                 BARTLEBY

(considering it)

Well... he does hate competition.

(reading article)

And this Mooby deninitely falls under that heading.

The church we have to go to is where?

                                 BARTLEBY

New ]ersey. The Rededication is in four days.

The doors open. They get on. Other people are inside as well.

                                   LOKI

Our last four days on earth. If I had a dick, I'd go get laid. But we can
do the next best thing.

BARTLEBY

What's that?

LOKI

Let's kill people.

A guy beside Loki reacts. Loki smiles at him as the elevator doors close.

OPENING CREDITS

Between black cards with white credits there are shots of the OLD MAN from
the boardwalk being wheeled into a hospital on a gurney, being treated in
the emergeny room, being hooked up to life support system, and finally
resting in an intensive care wing.

EXT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY

The church sits on a grassy knoll in Mc Henry - a suburb of Chicago. Some
kids tear by on bikes and egg it.

                                 OC PRIEST

The greater Illinois chapter of the Right to Life foundation will be
holding it's bi-annual softball game against the Cook County Pro-Choice
league next Sunday at two.

INT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY

The PRIEST speaks from the lectern, addressing semi-filled rows of the
faithful.

                                  PRIEST

Those who find the weekly demonstration outside of

the Twelfth Street Planned Parenthood Clinic hard to make due to work
schedules are urged to show their support in the fight against the
thoughtless and wanton destruction of life by cheering on our boys on the
field. Refreshments. as always, will be served.

Dollying down the rows while the Priest rattles on. we pass the
parishoners. Some listen intently, others are nodding off. One
surreptitiously listens to a Walk-man; a man and a woman quietly argue
while their kid colors in a coloring book, going off the page and marking
the pew; two kids play cards; one guy leafs through a copy of Hustler
hidden by his hymnal book.

                                 OC PRIEST

Today's second collection will be donated to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.
For those of you who haven't been following the news, an unidentified
homeless man who was accosted and severely beaten at the New Jersey shore
last Tuesday lies in critical but stable condition in one of that area's
hospitals. He lacks identification and police have had no luck in tracking
down any possible family. While he shows no signs of recovery, the
Arch-Bishop of the Trenton Diocese has disputed the state's decision to
remove the indigent man from life support systems, asking that Catholics
all over the country join in this protest against Euthanasia. And finally -
will whoever keeps parking in my spot, stop doing that. Thank you. Now,
please rise for the recession of faith. We believe in one God, the
father...

As the congregation flatly joins in the prayer, we stop on BETHANY - a
beautiful twenty-something woman who struggles to stay awake. She checks
her watch and exhales softly.

                                 OC VOICE

I don't really want to be here.

ENT PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC - DAY

A small gaggle of signcarrying RIght-to-Lifer's march in front of the
sterile looking building.

                                 OC VOICE

But then again, I guess nobody ever does... except maybe you.

INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY

The source of the voice - a GIRL - sits beside Bethany's desk, stretching
out her gum. Bethany offers her an understanding smile.

                                   GIRL

You know, I've done this three times now; and each time the counselor tells
me I should be more careful in the future, I should show' some
responsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the first time the
counselor wasn't some ugly as hell old bitch. It's kind of hard to take
abortion advice from a woman who's too gross to get laid in the first
place.

                                  BETHANY

I'm not here to lecture you - I'm here to make sure you really want to go
through with this.

                                   GIRL

I'd rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and down
he was sterile. Short of that, there aren't many choices left, now are
there?

                                  BETHANY

Ever think about having it?

                                   GIRL

                                  (beat)

What woman doesn't on some level.

BETHANY

I never did.

GIRL

                               (incredulous)

You had an abortion?

                                  BETHANY

(lights a smoke)

My first year in college. All through high school, I'd dated the same guy -
Walter Flanagan. We were really in love, right? So much so. that we decided
to go Carnegie Mellon together... that's this college in Pittsburgh. So
there we are -away at school, and there's suddenly no parents to worry
about anymore, so we're screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing it.
And I wound up getting pregnant. So he begs me to have it. He says we
should quit school and get married, and I'm telling him that that'lI screw
up our educations. We fought about it for a week - my arguement being there
was no rush to have kids, you know? We could always have a baby in a couple
of years - after school. So I got the abortion against his wishes... I
mean, what the hell - it was my body, right? After graduation, we got
married and immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hell
for the first six months, and... nothing. So I went to a gynocologist to
see if everything was okay on my end.

                                  (beat)

                                It wasn't.

(takes a drink)

My uteran wall had this fissure. It seems that the doctor who performed the
procedure on me years before had somehow botched it. I'd never be able to
have a child.

The Girl's face says it all. Bethany takes a drag and continues.

                                  BETHANY

So there I am - devastated. And now I have to go home to break the news to
my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby - his baby. And
after I explain it to him through my tears, he sits on the couch and rubs
his eyes. And in the calmest, most rational voice I've ever heard anybody
use in my life, he asks me for a divorce. And I fought him, you know? I
tried to talk him out of it; told him there were alternatives - like we
could adopt. And all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his
children.

GIRL

                                  (beat)

What happened?

                                  BETHANY

He remarried. He had two kids in two years with his new wife. We never
spoke again. And now I do this.

                                   GIRL

That's like... such a sad story.

                                  BETHANY

I dated this guy a year or two ago - he was really into comic books. He
told me I had the stock superhero story -I wanted to prevent a wrong that
had happened to me from ever happening to anyone else. Kind of like Batman,
he said. The only difference is I don't put on tights to do it... unless
all my other clothes are in the wash.

(smiles and puts out her smoke)

So... let's go over your paperwork.

EXT CLINIC - DAY

A well-dressed LIZ maneuvers through the small thrall of Right-to-lifer's.
They shake their placards at her accusingly.

                                PROTESTOR 1

You should be ashamed of yourself!

PROTESTOR 2

Child killer!

                                    LIZ

(looking over their shoulders)

HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE POPE!!

As the thrall turns excitedly in an effort try to spy the imaginary
pontiff, Liz ducks inside the clinic.

INT CLINIC COFFEE ROOM - DAY

A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE fills the frame - "CHURCH SAYS NO TO DEATH OF JOHN
DOE". It's lowered to reveal Bethany, reading. Liz enters and hangs up her
coat.

                                    LIZ

Jesus! You're a Catholic, aren't you? Can't you talk

to them or something?

                                  BETHANY

They hate me more than you, no doubt. At least you have an excuse - you're
]ewish,

you don't know any better.

                                    LIZ

I don't think they'd accept that one - we already used it as our excuse for
killing Christ. So where were you yesterday morning - a bunch of us went
out for brunch?

BETHANY

I went to church.

                                    LIZ

That kills me. You and church. We work in a field that specializes in
pissing off the cloth and you add insult to injury by breaking bread with
them every week.

                                  BETHANY

I sit there every Sunday and I feel nothing. I can remember sitting in
church when I was a kid and being moved - like everything meant something,
like I was important. And the stories of all these holy people were so
inspiring. Now I sit there and think about my checking, and what I'm going
to wear to work the next day.

                                    LIZ

So then why do you still go?

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

                                    LIZ

You think I'm going to mock your religious beliefs? We're friends, Bethany
- I may mock you for being a divorce' at twenty five who's never had an
orgasm, but I'd never mock you for having faith.

                                  BETHANY

That's just it - I don't. I don't think I have any faith left.

                                    LIZ

(making coffee)

I had a girl in here once - 'bout fifteen. She told me that faith is like a
glass of water. When you're young, the glass is full, and it's easy to fill
up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount
of water doesn't fill the glass anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be
refilled.

                                  BETHANY

A fifteen year old who came in here said that?

                                    LIZ

She had gotten knocked up by her pastor.

                                  BETHANY

Jesus! See? A minister knocks up a teenager -isn't anyone afraid of the
Lord's wrath anymore?

                                    LIZ

That would require faith, and that commodity lately seems reserved only for
the psychotic zealots that hang around outside.

(collects her things to leave)

So what are you doing tonight?

                                  BETHANY

Watching T.V.

                                    LIZ

Girl, you need a man. If only for ten minutes.

                                  BETHANY

It's been my experience that the average male is never a man - not even for
ten minutes in his entire life span.

                                    LIZ

Uh-oh - that sounds militant. You thinking of joining the other side?

                                  BETHANY

Couldn't do it. Women are insane.

                                    LIZ

Then girl, you better get back to church and ask God for a third option.

BETHANY

I think God is dead.

                                    LIZ

The sign of a true Catholic.

Liz exits with her coffee. Bethany stares after her.

INT A QUAINT SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

The Stygian Triplets kneel on one knee before a high-backed leather chair,
upon which Sits a shadowy figure who we see from behind. They appear to be
in a den or library.

                              SHADOWY FIGURE

All proceeds according to plan. No doubt, the powers will attempt to
contact the Last Scion. You know where she is. She must be elliminated
befoie she enters the frav. When she is negated, there will be nothing to
interfere with our plan. Shuffle her loose her mortal coil, that we may
obtain our final glory.

                                  (beat)

Go.

The Stygian Triplets rise and skate off.

INT BETHANY'S KITCHIEN - NIGHT

The fridge door opens and Bethany glances around inside. She pulls out a
chocolate cake and closes the door.

INT BETHANY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bethany sits on the couch, eating cake with a fork and watching the OC t.v.
The theme song to Filmation's 'Batman and Robin' cartoon can be heard. She
sips some milk from a glass and has some more cake.

INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bethany's in bed, staring up at the ceiling. From the darkness, a creaking
floor board is heard. Bethany reacts, grabbing a bat from under her pillow.
She peers into the darkness, defensively wielding her bat.

Suddenly, the room explodes in flames. A huge fire that appears to be
shooting out from the floor ignites mere feet from Bethany's bed. Bethany
leaps back, taking a beat to stare, mesmerized. Looking closely, one can
see an anthropomorphic form standing in the blaze.

                                   VOICE

(powerful; booming)

BEHOLD THE METATRON - HERALD OF THE ALMIGHTY AND

VOICEOF THE ONE TRUE GOD!

The Voice repeats itself. Bethany darts out of bed and dashes out of the
room, quickly returning with a fire extinguisher. While the voice is in
mid-sentence, she blasts the thing with the contents of the canister,
swirling the nozzle around to hit all the flames. The booming Voice
sputters and starts coughing, losing it's impressive edge. Bethany stops
squirting and turns on her bedside lamp.

A choking, drenched, and coughing androgynous figure in a suit waves her
away. The figure coughs up some of the extinguisher's contents and drops to
the floor, hacking. It is METATRON. Bethany stares, shocked.

                                 METATRON

(between coughs)

Sweet. ..Jesus! Did you... have to empty...the whole can?!

Bethany grabs her bat again and holds it up, this time offensively.

                                  BETHANY

WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM?!

                                 METATRON

(slowly rising to it's feet)

I'm the one... who's soaked and... she's the one who's pissed. That's rich!

                                  BETHANY

(reaching for phone, still holding bat)

I'm calling the cops! Breaking and entering, attempted arson... they're
going to lock you up for life...!

                                 M ETATRON

(wiping off clothes)

No dial tone.

                                  BETHANY

(ear to phone)

You cut the phone lines...

(even more offensive with bat)

Get the fuck out of here, now!

                                 METATRON

Or you'll what - hit me with that fish?

The bat Bethany held is now a salmon. She drops it to the floor and freaks.

                                 METATRON

Now just sit down on the bed and shut up!

                                  BETHANY

Oh God - you're going to rape me...

                                 METATRON

I'm not going to rape you.

(to itself; off clothes)

Look at my suit...!

                                  BETHANY

Take whatever you want, just don't kill or rape me...

                                 METATRON

Enough with the raping already! I couldn't rape you if I wanted to.

(unzips pants and pulls them off)

Angels are ill-equipped.

Bethany stares. There, before her, stands the exposed Metatron. There is
nothing where some sexual genitalia should be - it's as smooth and
anatomically impaired as a Ken doll.

                                 METATRON

See? I'm as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll.

(rings out pants)

You meat-puppets and your arrogance - you think everyone's just waiting to
rape you.

                                  BETHANY

Wh..what are you?

                                 METATRON

I'm pissed is what I am. You go around drenching everyone that comes into
your room with flameretardent chemicals? No wonder you don't get laid.

(pulls pants back on)

Go get me a towel, will you?

Bethany blinks. She exits the room and comes back with a towel. She holds
it out to Metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off.

                                 METATRON

(taking off jacket)

Stand back.

Bethany steps back. Metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from it's
back, dripping water. Bethany goes wide-eyed and cowers against the wall.

                                 METATRON

(tosses towel away)

Like I was saying - I am the Metatron.

Bethany stares, saying nothing, pinned against the wall. Metatron looks
insulted.

                                 METATRON

Metatron. Don't tell me the name doesn't ring a bell?

Bethany remains silent and wideyed. Metatron gets testy.

                                 METATRON

You people. If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing, right?

                                  (beat)

I am a seraphim.

(beat)

The highest choir of angels?

(beat)

You do know what an angel is, don't you?

Bethany slowly nods.

                                 METATRON

Metatron acts as the voice of God. Any documented occasion when some yahoo
claims to have spoken with God, they're speaking to me. Or they're speaking
to themselves.

                                 BET HANY

                                  (beat)

Why doesn't God speak for himself?

                                 METATRON

Ah. So glad you decided to join the conversation. To answer that - human
beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand
the awesome

power of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, you're mind would cave in
and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adam's
before we figured that out.

                                  BETHANY

Are you going to kill me?

                                Ni ETATRON

I could for what you did to this suit. Unfortunately I can't. You're
called.

                                 BETH ANY

                                  (beat)

Called how? How called?

                                 METATRON

All that from two words. Color this angel impressed.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

How do I know you're an angel?

                                 METATRON

Oh, you mean besides the fiery entrance and the expansive wingspan? You
people kill me. Fine. You want more proof? How about a tequila?

(snaps fingers)

INT MEXICAN BAR - NIGHT

Bethany and Metatron sit at a table. Bethany immediately clutches at her
pajamas. Metatron waves a WAITER over.

                                  BETHANY

Where the hell are we?!

                                 METATRON

The only place one can go for good tequila.

(to Waiter)

Dos tequilas, por favor. And an empty glass.

                                  WAITER

Si.

The Waiter turns to leave. Metatron yanks a smoke from his pocket as he
goes.

                                 METATRON

Gracias, senor.

                                  BETHANY

We're in Mexico?!

                                 METATRON

Actually, we're in the Chilli's down the street from your house, but it was
                         still an impressive trick

(lights smoke)

You don't mind that I lost the wings, do you? I'm trying to keep our
profile low.

                                  BETHANY

I suppose it would be too cliche to observe aloud that this is the weirdest
dream I've ever had.

                                 METATRON

Can you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have them
insist you're a dream? If I had an ego, it'd be bruised.

                                  BETHANY

What do you want with me?

                                 METATRON

I'm to charge you with a holy crusade.

(pause)

You do know what a crusade is, don't you?

                                  BETHANY

(sarcastically)

Uh, yeah.

                                 METATRON

Don't give me that. Last time I charged someone with a crusade they had to
look the word up.

                                  BETHANY

Why am I supposed to go on a crusade?

                                 METATRON

Your's is a heritage divine. Also, you didn't seem to be doing much lately.

The Waiter arrives with their drinks.

                                 METATRON

Oh - Gracias!

(he leaves; off the tequila)

One of the only things your people have mastered since you crawled from the
primordial ooze.

(sips)

                                  BETHANY

I work in an abortion clinic.

                                 METATRON

(spits tequila into empty glass)

Moses was a drunk. Look what he accomplished. And no one's even asking you
to part an ocean. All you have to do is go to New Jersey.

                                 BETH ANY

New ]ersey.

                                 METATRON

Sure. Go to New Jersey and visit and small church on a very important day.
Agreed?

                                  BETHANY

That doesn't sound like a crusade.

                                 METATRON

Aside from the fine print, that's it.

                                  BETHANY

What's the fine print?

                                 METATRON

(mumbles into glass)

stopacoupleofangelsfromenteringandthusnegatingallexistence.

Damn, this is good tequila.

(sips)

                                  BETHANY

Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

                                 METATRON

Damn, this is good tequila?

                                  BETHANY

The first part.

                                 METATRON

(spits into empty glass)

Details. Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all
existence. God, I hate when people need it spelled out for them.

                                  BETHANY

Clarify that.

                                 METATRON

That's the problem with you people - you need every-thing clarified. No
leaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou want the whole secret origin? Here
goes: Back in the old days, God was vengeful and hot-tempered, and his
wrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki. When Sodom and
Gommorah were destroyed? That was Loki. When the waters wiped out
everything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie? That was Loki. And
he was good at what he did. But one day, he refused to bear God's wrath any
longer.

                                  BETHANY

Why?

                                 METATRON

Because he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby.

                                  BETHANY

Grigori?

                                 METATRON

One of the choirs of angels. They're called Watchers. Guess what they do?

                                  BETHANY

So they're like Guardian angels?

                                 METATRON

Exactly like that, but different. So one day, Loki's wiping out all the
first born of Egypt...

                                  BETHANY

The Tenth Plague.

                                 METATRON

See? Tell a person you're the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy;
mention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and they're suddenly
theology scholars. May I continue uninterrupted?

(Bethany nods)

So once he's done with the first born, Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds, they get into this
discussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay. Now,
Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually, not to mention the
fact that Loki's more than half in the bag, and in the end, Bartleby
convinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one that
doesn't involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he quits:
throws down his fiery sword, gives him the finger - which ruins it for the
rest of us. because from that day forward, God decreed that angels could no
longer imbibe alcohol. Hence all the spitting.

                                  BETHANY

Sounds reasonable.

                                 METATRON

Maybe to you, but I'm a lush by nature.

                                  BETHANY

I mean about the angel of Death's resignation.

                                 METATRON

For a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel of Death we're talking about. The
Angel of Death can't be a conscientious objector. The Angel of Death is
charged with meting out whatever justice God demands. So for their
insolence, God decreed that neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

                                  BETHANY

Were they sent to Hell?

                                 METATRON

Worse. Wisconsin. For the entire span of human history. And when the world
ends, they'll sit outside the gates for eternity.

                                  BETHANY

And what's this have to do with me?

                                 METATRON

Somebody's clued them in to a loophole in Catholic dogma that would allow
them to reenter Heaven.

                                  BETHANY

So what? They beat the system. Good for them.

                                 METATRON

It's not that simple. If they get in, they will have reversed God's decree.
Now listen up because this part is very important: existence in all it's
form and splendor functions solely on one principle: God is infallible. To
prove God wrong would undo reality and everything that is. Up would become
down, black would become white, existence would become nothingness. In
essence - if they are allowed to enter that church, they'll unmake the
world.

                                  BETHANY

Are these guys that bitter?

                                 METATRON

No, that's the stupid part: they have no idea what their actions will
result in. As far as they know, they're just going home. Isn't that sweet?

                                  BETHANY

If this is so major, why are you talking to me? Why doesn't God do
something?

                                 METATRON

He could. He could blink them out of existence, destroy that church, turn
them into plants. But He'd rather see you take care of this one personally.

                                  BETHANY

Why me?

                                 METATRON

Because of who you are.

                                  BETHANY

And who am I?

                                 METATRON

The girl in the p.j.'s. Don't ask so many questions just serve your
purpose.

                                  BETHANY

I'll pass.

                                 METATRON

I beg your pardon?

                                  BETHANY

When some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God? When
my

husband decided he couldn't be with a wife that couldn't bear his children
- where was

God? Now all the sudden, after all these years of quiet noninvolvement in
my life, He

sends one of His lackey's my way who tells me I should save the world, and
as what -

some sort of test? To Hell with Him.

                                 METATRON

Do yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor: let go of your petty
crap. It's served you precious little in the past, and it serves you even
less now when the fate of existence

hangs in the balance. Don't allow eons of history and life to get blinked
out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator.

                                  BETHANY

A grudge? Do you know why I work in that clinic? It's my own private way of
saying

"fuck you" to God.

                                 METATRON

And any other day I'd say that's your business and your life, and enjoy
yourself and goodnight. But this isn't about you - this is about eve~body.
So you lost the abiliry to make life. You're being offered the chance to
play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving it.

(swigs her drink and spits it out)

But I can't make you. You'll do what you will. However, if you should
decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility, you won't be
alone. You'll have support.

                                  BETHANY

What, more angels?

                                 NIETATRON

Prophets - although they don't quite get it yet. You'll know them right
away - one speaks, the other listens. The one who speaks - and he will at
great lengths, whether you want him to or not - will make mention of
himself as a prophet. The other one won't say anything, but he'll be
helpful

just the same.

(looks at watch)

I have to go. You'll do what you will, but try to remember that we're
working in a time frame here.

Metatron moves to exit.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Hey.

(Metatron turns)

You work for God.

                                 METATRON

They tell me it's God. If it's not, I'm going to be severely pissed - what
with all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and
expectorating perfectly good tequila.

                                  BETHANY

What's he like? God?

                                 METATRON

(thinks)

Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor.

                                  BETHANY

I'll bet.

                                 METATRON

Look at sex. Sex is funny. One time I asked him why you people had to look
so stupid while procreating. He said if you didn't, you'd do it all the
time, just for fun.

                                  BETHANY

But we do.

                                 METATRON

I know. And you all look so damn stupid doing it. It kills us upstairs.

                                  BETHANY

Sex is a joke in Heaven?

                                 METATRON

The way I understand it, it's mostly a joke down here too.

And with that, Nietatron is gone. Bethany looks at her drink. A three-man
mariachi band surround her and begin playing Prince's 'Little Red
Corvette'.

INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bethany startles awake. The radio on her night-table plays 'Little Red
Corvette'. She lays back down.

INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY

Bethany sits at her desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girl
speaks, butBethany's not really listening. She's extremely preoccupied.

INT CLINIC - NIGHT

Bethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms. She packs up her bag and
turns on the alarm.

EXT CLINIC - NIGHT

Bethany exits and locks the door behind her. She starts walking.

As her feet tread lightly toward her car, three small shadows move toward
her.

Bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse for
her keys. She hears something and stops. Roller blades can be heard moving
slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot. Bethany turns quickly.

Nobody's there. She looks around, a bit peturbed.

                                  BETHANY

(calling into the darkness)

God, what time do you people quit and go home?! Let's just save it for
tomorrow, alright?

There's no response. Then there's the noise of wood being tapped against
the ground. Bethany peers into the darkness, looking for the source.

Suddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of her
knee. Bethany goes down. Another skater whips in and slashes at her, but
she ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through her
purse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with his
stick. Bethany looks up.

The Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her. They tap
their hockey sticks in unison on the ground. Bethany jumps up and faces
them defensively. The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her.

And from out of nowhere, a large figure swoops down from above, landing on
the ground between Bethany and her menacers. The Triplets stop short and
regard the figure curiously. The large figure whips into a defensive
stance, Batman-style.

The Stygian Triplets look to one another. They shrug and charge anew.

From behind the rock-still large figure, a smaller figure leaps into the
streetlight, shrieking, flying through the air, busting into a flying kick.
He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in the
face, grabbing his stick from the falling child's hand and tossing it into
the air behind him.

The stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of the
large figure, who twirls it under his arm, and then back Out like a sai. He
swings it out before him, knocking the other two Triplets off balance. The
smaller figure back flips into the larger figure's arms and kicks his feet
into the faces of the two wobbling Triplets. They go down, and the smaller
figure leaps forward with a shriek, landing between the fallen pair, elbows
into their backs.

The flrst struck Triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large figure,
screaming something unholy. The large figure catches the kid by the throat
and quickly

head butts him, tossing him to the side. The large figure sways for a beat
and then shakes it off.

The small figure collects the hockey sticks and throws them into the
distance. He kicks at the falien Triplets as they scurry away.

                               SMALL FIGURE

(calling after them)

GO BACK TO YOUR PAPER ROUTES, YOU PUNK FUCKS!

(more to himself)

Snoogans.

The large figure saddles up beside the small figure. They look at one
another and shake hands.

                               SMALL FIGURE

Dude, I know they were just kids, but we kicked their fucking asses!

Bethany stares, mystified. She grabs her purse from the ground.

                                  BETHANY

Where... where did you learn to do... that stuff?!

                               SMALL FIGURE

From this comic book some guys made about us. Long story.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

I don't know what to say... or think.

The figures turn into the light, revealing the faces of the heroes for the
first time - two very familiar faces.

                               SMALL FIGURE

Say you'll offer us sex as a reward.

                                  BETHANY

Who are you?

The large figure lights up a smoke. The small one extends his hand.

                               SMALL FIGURE

Jay. And this is my business associate, Silent Bob.

                                 BIETHANY

Well thank you for being out here so late... Come to think of it, what are
you doing out here so late?

(freezes)

Wait a second are you protestors?

                                    JAY

What's a protestor?

                                  BETHANY

You're not with the Fight-to-Lifer's?

                                    JAY

You mean those fucks with the signs and pictures of dead babies? Shit no.
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice:a woman 5 body is her own fucking
business.

                                  BETHANY

Then - I don't mean to sound ungrateful - but what are you doing hanging
around?

                                    JAY

We're here to pick up chicks.

                                  BETHANY

(a bit stunned)

Excuse me?

                                    JAY

We figure an abortion clinic is a good place to meet loose women. Why else
would they be there unless they like to fuck.

                                  BETHANY

(taken aback)

Oh. Right. Well, I should be going. Thanks for the rescue... I think.

                                    JAY

(shocked)

Wait, wait, wait - we just saved your ass, and you're just going to take
off? What the shit is that?

                                  BETHANY

I had a weird night last night, and now tonight's not shaping up to be any
better. I think I should go home, take some percosets, and lay down.

(opens her car door)

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

How about that shit? Fuck this town, man - I'm going back to Jersey and
selling weed~

(they start walking)

At least there I can get turned down while trying to make myself a profit.

Bethany freezes. Metatron's words echo in her ear. She shakes her head.

                                  BETHANY

(to herself)

You've gotta be kidding me.

(thinks for a beat; then) Hey! Wait!

She runs up to them. They whip around and raise their fists defensively.

                                  BETHANY

Sorry.

(beat)

Would you... I can't believe I'm doing this...

(inhales deeply)

Would you... like to have a drink with me?

Jay's face lights up. He punches Silent Bob in the arm.

                                    JAY

See?! I told you if we hung around outside that place we'd get laid! Thank
you!

(looking skyward)

Thank you, God!

INT SEEDY GUN SHOP - NIGHT

Various guns are laid out atop a glass case.

                                OC SALESMAN

Now this piece is nice. It's not lightweight, but one look at it and nobody
- I mean nobody - is going to fuck with you. Try it on.

Loki picks up the gun. Bartleby and the SALESMAN look at him.

                                   LOKI

It's a lot more compact than the flaming sword, I'll say that much.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's the weapon of choice these days.

                                   LOKI

It seems unimpressive. At least the sword looked intimidating. How can I
strike fear into the hearts of the wicked with this?

                                 SALESMAN

Oh, I get it. You want to become a vigilante, right? Like Batman or
something.

                                   LOKI

Batman never uses guns.

(off gun)

I don't know. It feels impersonal.

                                 BARTLEBY

Then don't use a gun. Just lay the place to waste like Sodom and Gommorah.
Now that was something.

                                   LOKI

Oh yeah, for you maybe. You got to stand there and read. I had to do all
the work.

                                 BARTLEBY

What work? You lit a few fires.

                                   LOKI

I rained down sulfur, man. There's a subtle difference.

                                 BARTLEBY

Sure.

                                   LOKI

Are you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire.
Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance. Mass genocide is the
most exhausting activity one can engage in, next to soccer.

(to Salesman)

I'll take this one.

                                 SALESMAN

Five seventy five to walk with it right now.

Loki starts sifting through his wallet.

                                 BARTLEBY

Soccer?

INT DINER - NIGHT

An English muffin is covered with a knife-full of jam. Bethany raises the
bread to her mouth and takes a bite. She glances at the OC pair and stops
chewing.

Jay and Silent Bob study her intently. Jay smiles widely, anticipatory, and
nods.

All three sit at a small table near a window. Bethany puts the English
muffin down and brushes off her hands. Jay's feet are moving a mile a
minute.

                                  BETHANY

Are you both from around here?

                                    JAY

I'm hard as hell.

                                  BETHANY

Do you live in the city?

                                    JAY

Do you have a friend for Silent Bob, or are you going to do us both? If so,
I'm first. I hate sloppy seconds.

                                  BETHANY

You're a man of principle. Where do you come from?

                                    JAY

We used to live in a small town in Jersey. Real small town. We practically
knew everybody.

                                  BETHANY

What brought you to McHenry?

                                    JAY

Hollywood.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Hollywood?

                                    JAY

Oh yeah. See, we used to sell smoke in front of this video store. And one
day this fuck wants to rent a video. So we did, only we didn't have
anyplace to watch it. So we went to the mall and popped it into a VCR at
Macy's and sat on the floor and watched it. It was called 'Sixteen
Candles'. Did you ever see it?

                                  BETHANY

Yes.

                                    JAY

So the next day we rented 'The Breakfast Club', and then 'Weird Science'
where these two fucks have a chick that'll do anything for them and they
don't do nothing because it's a PG movie. But then we got thrown out of
Macy's when we watched 'Pretty in Pink', because of this bitch.

(points to Silent Bob)

                                  BETHANY

(to Silent Bob)

What'd you do?

                                    JAY

You know how at the end the red-headed bitch gets together with her dream
guy at the prom?

(Bethany nods)

Well pussy here starts fuckin' sobbing all sorts of loud and shit. And the
manager's like "Get the hell out of here!" And I'm like "Fuck you, you bald
cocksucker! I'll kick your lard..

                                  BETHANY

(speeding him along)

So what exactly brought you to Illinois?

                                    JAY

Oh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a town called Shermer, in
Illinois. And there's all this fine bush running around, and we could kick
all the dude's asses because they're all whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson
- he was harsh. But best of all, there was no one selling weed. So I says
to Silent Bob "Man, we could live phat if we were the blunt-connection in
Shermer, Illinois!" So we collected some cash we were owed, and caught a
bus. But when we got here,

you know what we found Out? There is no Shermer in Illinois. What kind of
shit is that?! Fucking movies are bullshit!

                                  BETHANY

And now you live here?

                                    JAY

Fuck that. This berg sucks. Everyone talks with a stupid accent so you
don't know what they're saying, and it's too fuckin' cold. We were talking
about taking off. Until we met you, that is.

(kisses her hand)

                                  BETHANY

(retracts her hand)

Right. So how much longer are you staying here?

                                    JAY

Until you're ready to skip out and make with the sex.

                                  BETHANY

No. How long are you staying in McHenry?

                                    JAY

We're leaving tomorrow.

                                  BETHANY

Where are you going next?

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Jesus - this broad asks alot of questions.

(to Bethany)

Back to Jersey. We've been going straight for like five

years now. It's about time for us to retire or something. Enjoy our salad
years. No more adventures.

                                  BETHANY

I see.

(sips her coffee)

                                    JAY

Yeah. So do you do anal? Is it true that chicks fart if you blast them in
the ass?

                                  BETHANY

I didn't ask you out for sex.

                                    JAY

I'll take head.

                                  BETHANY

I don't know why, but...

(composes herself)

...I want to go with you.

                                    JAY

What, like steady? You wanna be my girlfriend?

(shrugs to Silent Bob)

Alright, but Silent Bob has to live with us and you pay the rent.

                                  BETHANY

No, I want to go with you to New Jersey.

                                    JAY

Really? You're the only chick I ever met that wanted to go to Jersey. Most
chicks try to get out.

                                  BETHANY

When can we leave?

                                    JAY

Wait a second! What is this shit? Are we going fuck or not?

                                  BETHANY

You're going to lead me somewhere.

                                    JAY

Me lead you? Lady, I don't even know where I am half the time. If we're not
going to fuck then what the hell did you ask me out for?

                                  BETHANY

Someone told me I'd meet you, and you'd take me somewhere I was supposed to
go. I didn't believe it until you said that thing in the parking lot.

                                    JAY

What the hell are you babbling about? All I know is we saved your ass from
some angry fucking dwarfs and you promised us se~..

(to Silent Bob)

Didn't this crazy bitch promise us sex?

(to Bethany)

...and now you're telling me that I'm supposed to take you somewhere, and
you don't even know where it is?

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Do you believe in God?

                                    JAY

(horrified)

Holy shit - you're a Jehovah's Witness! All the fine chicks that come out
of that place, and we gotta get the one Jesus freak!

(to Silent Bob, getting up)

Let's go...

                                  BETHANY

(grabbing his sleeve)

No. wait...

                                    JAY

(pulling back)

I'll scream rape.

                                  BETHANY

I can pay you.

                                    JAY

(quickly sitting back down)

Pay?

                                  BETHANY

For being my guide. You were going to leave anyway; all I'm asking is to
tag along and see where it leads. I'll pay a hundred bucks and all
expenses.

                                    JAY

(thinks; to Silent Bob)

I feel like I'm Han Solo, and you're Chewie, and she's Ben Kenobi, and
we're in that fucked up bar.

(to Bethany)

What about sex?

                                  BETHANY

No sex.

                                    JAY

Alright, but let's say we're caught in a situation where we've got like
five minutes to live, like a bomb or something is gonna go off - would you
fuck us then?

                                  BETHANY

In that highly unlikely situation?

(beat)

Yeah, sure.

                                    JAY

Yeah? You slut. Noonch.

(to Silent Bob)

What do you think?

Silent Bob shrugs. Jay stands up.

                                    JAY

Alright. But I'll drive.

EXT MAIN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Bethany's car roars overhead, speeding down the road, reving awfully
loudly.

INT BETHANY'S CAR - NIGHT

The speedometer reads ninety five.

Jay drives, eyes glued to the road. happy as hell. Silent Bob smokes to his
right. Bethany sits pinned against the back seat, wearing an uncomfortable
and dubious look. She struggles to lean forward. The engine still races.

                                  BETHANY

(yelling over engine noise)

What gear are you in?

                                    JAY

(not looking back)

Gear?

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jay, Silent Bob, and Bethany sit on and against the car. The hood is open
and smoke billows out.

                                    JAY

(defensively)

Well what do I know from shifting?! Like I ever drove before!

Silent Bob shrugs and smokes. Bethany walks away, shaking her head.

                                    JAY

Chicks.

Silent Bob nods and extracts a tool from his jacket. He begins working on
the engine as a cross~ountry bus races by.

INT BUS - NIGHT

Bartleby and Loki sit in the back. Bartleby reads a map and Loki stares at
the gun in his lap. A COUPLE makes out in the seat in front of them.

                                 BARTLEBY

We have to pass through three more states to get to New Jersey: Indianna,
Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

                                   LOKI

With a very important stop in Cleveland.

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh right. The Angel of Death Returns. Sounds like a bad movie.

                                   LOKI

Movies are bullshit. And don't start with me, airight. The last time you
bugged me about my job, you got us sentenced to life in Wisconsin.

(looks out window)

All this time we've been down here, why didn't we ever leave the Cheese?

                                 BARTLEBY

He said to stay where he put us. We feared worse punishment if we disobeyed
Him again.

                                   LOKI

Where were we afraid He'd send us?

                                 BARTLEBY

New Jersey.

                                   LOKI

Now that, my friend. is irony.

                                 BARTLEBY

(beat)

You know, maybe you're wrong about this slaughter. How can you even be sure
of what incurs the Lord's wrath these days? Times change. Remember when
eating meat on Friday was supposed to be a Hellworthy tresspass? Or when
people weren't even supposed to shop on Sundays?

                                   LOKI

That stuff was small potatoes. The major sins never change. And believe me
- I can spot a commandment breaker a mile away.

                                 BARTLEBY

Sure.

                                   LOKI

You don't believe me?

(looks around; eyes fall on kissing couple)

There. There's one.

                                 BARTLEBY

(off couple)

So what? They're kissing.

                                   LOKI

Adultery.

                                 BARTLEBY

That's a stretch. How do you know they're not dating?

                                   LOKI

You'd know better than me - let's hear it.

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh, I know the truth. But let's see how boned up on the job you really are.

                                   LOKI

A test?

                                 BARTLEBY

Of sorts. So what's your proof?

                                   LOKI

He's wearing a wedding band.

                                 BARTLEBY

So? Maybe that's his wife.

                                   LOKI

No married man kisses his wife like that. You get married and the passion
dies, man. Don't you ever watch talk shows?

                                 BARTLEBY

What are you talking about?

                                   LOKI

A guy makes his best plays when wooing. When the object of his desire is
won, there's no need to expend the effort anymore. He relaxes, satisfied
with the spoils of victory, which he then decides isn't so victorious
because he's saddled with a life-mate.

                                 BARTLEBY

Very romantic sentiment.

                                   LOKI

That's the problem - romance. You think about it :back in the old days,
nobody got married out of quote, unquote, love. People married for
property', dowries, or to procreate - to immortalize oneself through
offspring. When did all this love stuff start? What the hell happened to
the status quo?

                                 BARTLEBY

The Troubadors.

                                   LOKI

Lionel Richie's old group?

                                 BARTLEBY

No, that's the Commodores. The Troubadors were wandering minstrels and
dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy songs of undying love.

                                   LOKI

Sounds like the Commodores.

                                 BARTLEBY

The Troubadors made 'love' fashionable. And their influence altered the
balance in a significant fashion. Until them, people got married because
they had to. After them, people started 'falling in love'. Romantic
courtships became the norm. What started out as simple entertainment made
such a dramatic impact as to forever alter the way society operates.

                                   LOKI

That's human beings for you - easily misled. From the Garden of Eden to the
'Thigh Master' - thev believe what they're told. I'm telling you - one day
they're all going to watch one too many John Hughes flicks and start
looking for Shermer, Illinois.

                                 BARTLEBY

Be fair. Humans are dumb, but not that dumb.

(off couple)

So is it adultery or not?

                                   LOKI

(thinks; to couple)

Excuse me.

The Couple stops kissing. The MAN looks at Loki.

                                   LOKI

Are you married?

                                    MAN

(puzzled)

Why?

                                   LOKI

Just curious.

                                    MAN

(holds up ring finger)

What do you think?

The Man shakes his head and goes back to kissing. Bartleby offers Loki a
"Satisfled?' expression. Loki taps the Man on the shoulder.

                                    MAN

(breaks kiss; pissed)

What?!

                                   LOKI

To her?

                                    MAN

What?

                                   LOKI

Are you married to her?

                                    MAN

Not that it's any of your fucking business, but no! Why?!

Loki looks at Bartleby. Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki calmly shoots the man
in the head. Screaming ensues.

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The bus skids to a halt. People flock off in a panic. scattering. After a
beat, Bartleby and Loki deboard and stand there alone.

                                 BARTLEBY

You're such an asshole.

                                   LOKI

Don't blame me, man. Blame the Commodores.

                                 BARTLEBY

Troubadors.

EXT ROADSIDE OF HIGHWAY - DAWN

Silent Bob still tools around under the hood, Jay hands him various
wrenches. Bethany steams off to the side.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

She's pissed, dude. She'll never fuck us now. Well,

maybe you, but definitely not me.

(beat)

Let me know how she is.

                                  BETHANY

(turns on him)

Nobody is fucking me! You got that?!

                                    JAY

At least not in this car.

                                  BETHANY

(sighs)

I'm sorry I dragged you to that diner. I don't know what I was thinking.
But being that I've decided to go home and not to New Jersey, this is where
you two get off.

                                    JAY

You're breaking up with us?

                                  BETHANY

Good luck with finding Molly Ringwald, or whoever it is vou're looking for.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Good bye.

Bethany starts walking away. Jay stares at her, shocked.

                                    JAY

(to Bethany)

Who the hell do you think you are, lady? You can't go around breaking
people's hearts like that! We fell in love with you! Guys like us don't
just fall out of the sky, you know!

On cue, a naked black MAN falls from the sky. landing between the two
parties. Bethany and Jay stare at him. The Man is face down, sooty, and
ashen - as if he's just been in a fire. Bethany drops to her knees and
rolls him over, feeling for a pulse. Jay looks down, then looks skyward as
Silent Bob joins him.

                                    JAY

(yelling up)

A beautiful, naked woman doesn't just fall from the sky, you know?!

(beat; to Silent Bob)

Was worth a try.

Silent Bob nods. Bethany presses her ear to the man's chest.

                                  BETHANY

No heartbeat.

                                    JAY

Do you think he fell from a plane? Like 'Alive'? Did you ever see that
flick?

                                  BETHANY

(starts CPR'ing him)

I think there would have been more of a mess if he fell from that high.

                                    MAN

Not necessarily.

Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob leap back. The man sits up and rubs his face.

                                    JAY

KILL IT!! KILL IT!!

                                    MAN

That sounds familiar.

                                  BETHANY

Jesus, are you okay?

                                    MAN

Rufus. And yes, I'm fine.

                                    JAY

He's the fuckin' undead!! Cut his head off!!

                                   RUFUS

(getting up with Bethany's help)

What happened to your car? You clock ninety in first gear or something?

                                    JAY

Mind your own fucking business!

                                   RUFUS

(to Jay)

Listen, goldie-locks, what I just did was not easy and it ga\e me a fucking
migraine. Now if you don't pipe down, I'm going to rip your balls off.

                                    JAY

(hiding behind Silent Bob)

I knew it! Mother fucker wants to eat my brain!

                                  BETHANY

I think he was aiming a bit further south.

(to Rufus)

Speaking of which, you're awfully nude - Rufus, is it?

                                   RUFUS

Rufus it is, Miss.

(to Silent Bob)

Hey, tubby... how's about lending a brother your coat 'till I can find my
own threads?

Jay looks at Silent Bob.

                                    JAY

Dude, he fell out of thin air!

Silent Bob shrugs and passes his coat to Rufus. Jay bugs.

                                    JAY

Dude, his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the inside of your armor!

                                   RUFUS

(to Silent Bob)

I'll do my best to tuck it back, brother.

Silent Bob nods. Something OC catches his eye. He stares OC and exits.

                                  BETHANY

Where exactly did you fall from?

                                   RUFUS

Some might say grace.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Dude, he's talking about your mom.

Jay turns to see that Silent Bob isn't there.

Silent Bob peers at a large bush at the road side. The bush rustles
slightly.

                                OC BETHANY

You know, normally I'd have a hard time with this, but somehow you falling
out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff I've
been deaiing with.

                                 OC RUFUS

Believe me - you ain't seen nothing yet.

Silent Bob peers closer at the bush. Suddenly - a Stygian Triplet leaps out
at him, pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick.

The other two Triplets leap on top of Jay and BETHANY

Rufus grabs the one off Bethany and hurls him to the side.

Jay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of Penthouse. He
rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it.

Silent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it up
hard, into the Triplet's forhead, knocking him off. He rushes to Jay's side
and plies the other Triplet from his throat, hurling him OC.

The Triplet Silent Bob fought 'punctures' the air with his stick and rips
downward, creating a 'hole'. He grabs his friend and leaps into it,
disappearing.

Jay and Silent Bob look at eachother, blink, and embrace passionately.

The Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick in
lancing position. Without looking back, Rufus reaches behind himself,
grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in an
arch, letting go. The last Triplet goes sailing through the 'hole', and it
seals shut.

Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock.

                                    JAY

Alright - what's with you, lady?! That's the second time you got attacked
by the fucking Mighty Ducks!

                                   RUFUS

(wiping off hands)

Man, they're onto you bad, already. I got here just in time.

                                  BETHANY

How can you be so composed? We were almost killed.

                                   RUFUS

Death is a worry of the living. The dead only worry about decay and
necrophiliacs.

                                    JAY

See! I told you he was the undead!

                                  RU FUS

Not the undead, the dead. I died. Christ told me the secret to resurrection
once when we were at a wedding in Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it.

                                  BETHANY

                               (incredulous)

Wait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew Christ?

                                   RUFUS

Knew him? I saw him naked.

                                  BETHANY

Let me guess - you're another angel?

                                   RUFUS

No, I'm a man - just like you and him.

(looks at Jay)

Well, maybe not like him. At least I was a man. Been dead for nearly two
thousand years. Here.

(pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear)

                                    JAY

No wonder he saw Jesus - homey's rockin' the ganj.

                                  BETHANY

(unrollingit)

It's not a joint.

(looks at it)

I can't read this.

                                   RUFUS

It's Sanskiit. It says "Rufus - see you in two years. Jesus." Freaked me
out because he basically told me when my number was up. Took the flavor out
of the remaining years. Look, we gotta keep moving. If we stay in one place
long enough, those things are liable to come back. What say we continue
this discussion over something to eat?

                                  BETHANY

(snaps)

WAIT A SECOND!

(inhales deeply)

I'm a rational woman, okay. All I want to know is where you, and those...
kids came from?!

                                   RUFUS

They came from Hell. I came from Heaven.

(walking away)

Let's start walking.

                                    JAY

Walk? Do you know how far we are from anywhere?

                                   RUFUS

Back in the old days with J.C., we walked everywhere. Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

(exits)

Bethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability.

                                    JAY

What's an apostle?

Bethany shakes her head and exits. Jay and Silent Bob shrug at each other.

EXT MOOBY CORP. BUILDING - DAWN

A large office building in downtown Cleveland. The city. hasn't started up
yet. A pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure. Bartleby and
Loki jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck. offering waved
thank-you's to the driver. As the truck pulls away, Loki pulls out the
article and looks at it. He looks up at the building and nods to Bartleby,
smiling. They head toward the front doors.

INT QUAlNT SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWN

A ringing phone is answered by the unseen figure in the chair. We move from
the seated Figure, passing by the dead bodies of the home's original
owners, and come to a stop on the bruised and worn Stygian Triplets seated
on a couch. They look scared.

                                  FIGURE

Hello?... No, they're not in right now... I'm the phone guy... I'll leave
them a message... Bye.

The Figure hangs up the phone and rises.

                                  FIGURE

You say the girl has already met the prophets?

The Stygian Triplets nod.

                                  FIGURE

She grows closer to learning her true identity. If that happens, our plan
is jeopardized. I can't afford to go into the field - that might compromise
us further. The best course of action is to insure that our parcel is not
found. And being that I can't even trust you enough to kill a girl, I'm
left with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our package.

(sighs)

I'm going to have to summon the Golgothan.

The Figure exits. The Stygian Triplets register shock.

EXT FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWN

Rufus - now wearing some funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast food to
an outdoor table. Sitting already are Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob.

                                   RUFUS

(off new clothes)

It's amazing the shit people throw out. Didn't I tell you I'd find some
threads?

A car full of teens whip past them.

                                   TEEN

(yelling from passing car)

GARBAGE PICKER!

                                   RUFUS

(waves to them)

Thank you.

(to group)

What's that mean?

                                    JAY

It means they saw you pull that shit out of that dumpster.

                                   RUFUS

So it's a good thing, then.

(handing coat back to Silent Bob)

I appreciate the loan, brother. You can have this back.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Lucky you.

                                   RUFUS

(off food)

Damn, I remember when all we used to have for breakfast was fish and goat's
milk. What do you call this shit?

                                  BETHANY

(to Rufus)

Egg McMuffin. Now how about you start explaining some things to me.

                                   RUFUS

Like what?

                                  BETHANY

Like - for starters - who the hell are those kids that keep attacking me?

                                   RUFUS

Nasty little bastards called the Stygian Triplets. They're not really
related. When they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched a
neighbor's toddler and smashed it's skull in - "just to see what it looked
like" I believe was their defense. They were killed in a car wreck on the
way to a detention center.

                                  BETHANY

So they're dead too?

                                   RUFUS

You'd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around - we're
stubborn bastards. Thing is, those kids are supposed to be in Hell. Which
means that someone wants you out of the picture so badly they're willing to
summon demons.

                                  BETHANY

Is it those two angels I'm supposed to stop?

                                   RUFUS

Couldn't be. They're not evil - they're just stupid.

                                    JAY

(to Bethany)

Wait a minute - are you going to listen to this shit? We don't even know
who this guy is. For all you know, he's in with those fucks. They both
showed up at the same time.

                                  BETHANY

I hate to say it - but he does have a point. How did you know where to find
us?

                                   RUFUS

You know what the dead do with most of their time? They watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

I can't wait to die.

                                  BETHANY

And why are you watching me?

                                   RUFUS

Because you're the one who's going to help me get some changes made in that
book you all hold so much stock in.

                                    JAY

Hustler?

                                   RUFUS

The Bible.

                                  BETHANY

What's your beef with the Bible?

                                   RUFUS

I'm not in it.

                                    JAY

Neither are any of us, but you don't hear us bitching.

                                   RUFUS

But I'm supposed to be in it. I was the Thirteenth Apostle.

                                  BETHANY

I've been going to church my entire life and I've never heard of a
thirteenth apostle named Rufus.

                                   RUFUS

See? You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys, I might add.
But no mention of Rufus. And why? Cause I'm a black man. But that's just my
pet peeve. I mainly want to correct a major error that you people are
basing a faith on.

                                  BETHANY

What's that?

                                   RUFUS

Jesus wasn't white; He was black.

Rufus bites into his sandwhich. Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob look at him and
then each other.

                                    JAY

Bullshit. I've seen pictures of Jesus, and He has blonde hair and blue
eyes.

                                   RUFUS

(wiping hands)

That's what's particularly insulting. Between the time when He established
the faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-be
decided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He was
black was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric,
even though the brother was blacker than Jesse.

                                  BETHANY

If that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out?

                                   RUFUS

Well He is the Son of God, right? It's kind of hard to have the New
Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on His
ethnicity. Leaving me out's okay because there's still Twelve apostles to
choose from.

                                    JAY

I don't buy it.

                                   RUFUS

That's what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my ass.

                                  BETHANY

You were martyred?

                                   RUFUS

That's one way of putting it. Another way is to say I was bludgeoned to
shit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the world
and spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christian
following, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing about
Jesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was
black, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressed
the point, and before I know it, I'm wearing stones - although not to
accessonze.

                                 BETH ANY

Why didn't you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting?

                                   RUFUS

Because it's part of the facts. White folks only want to hear the good
shit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they're
getting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - is
called Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior.

(to Silent Bob)

You going to eat that hash brown?

                                  BETHANY

So you went to Heaven?

                                   RUFUS

Shit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep and
followed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time,
did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into His
message. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that He
was black. That's why I'm going to help you find stop those angels from
getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign.

                                  BETHANY

How do you know about that?

                                   RUFUS

Heaven's a pretty boring place, and anything that breaks the tedium is
news. The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great
tediumbreaker. Besides, there isn't much I don't know about you.

                                  BETHANY

I find that hard to believe.

                                   RUFUS

When you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand.

                                    JAY

(shocked)

You did that?

                                  BETHANY

Yeah... but I never told anyone about it.

                                   RUFUS

Neither did he. He died of Leukemia two years later. His name was...

                                  BETHANY

...BryanJohnson.

                                   RUFUS

Your exploits - no matter how inane - are well-known in Heaven. Probably in
Hell, too.

Bethany rubs her temples and exits OC. Rufus watches her go.

                                    JAY

(intrigued)

Tell me something about me.

                                   RUFUS

(preoccupied with the OC Bethany)

You masturbate more than anybody else on the planet.

                                    JAY

Shit, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows.

                                   RUFUS

You think about guys when you do it.

Rufus gets up and exits. Silent Bob looks at Jay, shocked.

                                    JAY

Not all the time!

Bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym, shaking her head. Rufus
joins her.

                                   RUFUS

I'm sorty if I spooked you.

                                  BETHANY

I just feel... violated. Like my life isn't mine exclusively.

                                   RUFUS

That's the way it goes with celebrities.

                                  BETHANY

What are you talking about? I'm a nobody. I'm just a quiet girl from the
suburbs who counsels pregnant teens.

                                   RUFUS

You sound like Christ. He had the same reaction when He found out who He
was, minus the quiet girl from the 'burbs angle. And like Him, I'm sure
you'll come to terms and do what you're supposed to.

                                  BETHANY

Why not get the pope or someone holy like that?

                                   RUFUS

Just because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn't make him the right man for
the job. Only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of
destruction. last time it was Jesus - this time it's you.

                                  BETHANY

Why me?

                                   RUFUS

Can't say yet. But the question is - are your hands capable enough to carry
the burden. It all rides on you.

                                  BFTRANY

(rubbing her temples)

Two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home. You know,
yesterday I wasn't sure God even existed. And now I'm upto my ass in
Christian Mythology.

                                   RUFUS

God hates it when it's referred to as Mythology.

                                  BFTHANY

Well then let's ask the quote, unquote 'prophets' what we should call it
instead.

(looking OC; concerned)

Now where did those two assholes go?

INT STRIP JOINT

It's your typical strip club. One woman on a stage and a crowd of men
paying way-too-much attention. The place is dimly lit with red lights and
chock full of smoke. Off to one side, a dee-jay spins records, blasting the
music. The crowd is rather thin.

Jay and Silent Bob sit at the stage. their eyes glued on...

The DANCER - a gorgeous, shapely vixen with very little clothing on, and
growing littler by the second.

Jay pokes Silent Bob, who produces a wad of bills. They skim off a nice
pile and stow the rest. They spread their piles neatly on the bar. The
Dancer smiles and starts dancing toward them. Jay holds up a five-spot and
performs his own little seductive dance ~th it. He stands at the edge of
the stage, ~'rating. The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in her
G-string. She rubs his head and slinks away. Jay humps Silent Bob's chair,
excitedly. Bethany and Rufus come up from behind them. Bethany hits Jay.

                                  BETHANY

(shouting above the music)

What are you doing?

                                    JAY

Proving to this bastard that I ain't gay.

                                  BETHANY

What?

                                   RUFUS

Long story - forget it. But we should get moving. How can we get to New
Jersey?

                                  BETHANY

I had a car.

She slaps Jay upside the head, but - riveted by the Dancer - he doesn't
feel it.

                                  BETHANY

(to Rufus)

We could go by train.

                                   RUFUS

(looking OC)

Sounds cool.

                                  BETHANY

There's a phone out there. I'll call for reservations.

Rufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side.

                                  BETHANY

No, it's okay. I can handle it.

Rufus half-nods. Bethany shakes her head and exits.

The Dancer gyrates on the stage, revealing more and more of herself.

Jay pounds on the stage, hoots, and dances, flashing more bills.

ACROSS THE STAGE a small GANG of bandanna-wearing, angry-looking blacks
watch the OC Jay with little amusement. The Dancer dances toward them.

                                    JAY

(banging on stage)

Sweet thing!

(Hashes another five)

Look what I found! Snoog!

The Dancer smiles as she approaches Jay, but is interrupted by more
banging.

The GANG LEADER has his foot on the stage. He produces a ten dollar bill
from his jacket and casually holds it up. The other three members of his
posse smile and slap hands.

The Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction, heading toward
the Gang. Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob.

The Gang Leader leans forward, preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiously
loud throat~learing.

Jay holds aloft a twenty, smiling and nodding.

The Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction. The Gang
Leader looks at his posse, who shake their heads at him, disappointedly.

The Stage becomes a bidding table, as - on one side - the Gang Leader
produces two twenties. On the other side, jay - staring at the Gang Leader
- produces three twenties. The Gang Leader hits his posse up for more cash.
Jay hits Silent Bob up for more cash. The Dancer stays in the middle,
gyrating and sizing up the best offer.

Jay then produces the creme'de Ia creme': three hundred dollar bills. He
sneers at the OC Gang Leader. The Dancer heads over to jay and wraps her
legs around him from the stage, gyrating against his groin. Jay stares at
the Gang Leader, a victorious smirk on his face.

The Gang Leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat,
producing a gun from his jacket. He fires into the ceiling. The music
scratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door. The Gang
Leader points his piece at Jay, his posse backing him up.

                                GANG LEADER

You a smart ass, ain'tcha, white boy? Come in here and ruin my good time.

                                    JAY

It's a free country. The bitch just came to the man with the most.

                                  DANCER

Bitch?

                                    JAY

No offense, baby.

                                GANG LEADER

The bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most - the man with the
most led in his piece. While you and tubby are leaving with the most led in
your dead fucking carcasses, know what I'm sayin?

                                    JAY

(to Dancer)

Step to the side, baby. I've gotta slap this pussyass, Nino Brown wanna-be
down.

                                  DANCER

(to Gang Leader)

Come on, Kane. This isn't necessary.

                                GANG LEADER

Shut the fuck up and back away from the midget!

The Dancer moves to the side.

                                GANG LEADER

(to Jay)

Now I believe you were about to apologize. I believe you were about to
intone some pleas for mercy. You were about to say "Please, Mister Kane, I
didn't mean to disrespect you in your club. Please accept my most humble
apology.

Bethany comes back and sees the mess. She moves to rush to Jay's side, but
Rufus holds her back An OC Jay laughs.

Jay leans on Silent Bob, laughing. The Gang stares back, angrily.

                                    JAY

You want an apology?

                                GANG LEADER

(cocks gun)

Give me at least one "I'm sorry," and ltll put a kill shot through that
thick fucking skull of your's. Otherwise we go slow and long in the pain
dispensation.

                                    JAY

(beat; zips jacket closed)

Know what I'm doing?

                                GANG LEADER

No. What you doing?

                                    JAY

I'm closing my jacket, so that when we start this up, I don't get your
filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt. You know why?

                                GANG LEADER

Why?

                                    JAY

Because you can't get shit stains out of flannel. What I'm saying is that
you got shit for brains.

The Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment.

                                GANG LEADER

Well I appreciate you breaking that down for me, but I got it without the
explanation.

                                    JAY

No. No, I don't think you did get it. See, there's gonna he some nine's
firing in here, and when the bullets stop flyin', your cunt-lip ass is
gonna be all holes and smoke. You think you can draw on me and walk away?
Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you a
monkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you, I'll bring a
coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave; stick a straw through it
and stick the other end in the ground. Your lips'll reach.

The Gang stares, mystified. Rufus and Bethany can't move they're so
frightened.

                                    JAY

You think every white boy cowers at your ass? Shit, if I don't fucking
plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will.

(thumbs at Silent Bob)

What do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he's gotta be
with me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn't talk in words
- he speaks in bullets. Re's all quiet cause he's thinking about how he's
gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets in
your bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he likes to see
the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down. Come to think of
it, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably don't even
understand big words like 'piss'. Tell you what - I'll let him explain it
to you.

(to Silent Bob)

Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches.

Silent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion. Jay looks at
him.

                                    JAY

What are you waiting for?!

Silent Bob shrugs.

                                    JAY

(flabbergasted)

YOU DON'T RAVE A GUN?!?

Silent Bob kind of nods

                                    JAY

(shocked)

WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN? ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND YOU DON'T
HAVE A GUN?!?

Silent Bob indicates the negative, sheepishly.

                                    JAY

THAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT! DO YOU THINK I

WOULD'VE SAID ALL THAT IF I'D KNOWN YOU

DIDN'T HAVE A GUN?!?

(beat)

HUNHH?!?

Silent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles.

GANG LEADER

What was that about a coconut?

Jay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob.

                                    JAY

No gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?! All this time and you got no
gun!

GANG LEADER

Oh boys! We have some unfinished business here.

                                    JAY

(sheepishly)

Can we talk this over?

                                GANG LEADER

Tell you what - you got thirty seconds. Then I cap you. Talk all you like.

Bethany goes to make a move, but Rufus holds her back, shaking his head. He
puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action,
smiling.

Jay fumes.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

I can't believe you.

(to Gang Leader)

Do me a favor.

(points to Silent Bob)

Shoot this piece of shit first.

(to Silent Bob; disgusted)

No gun!

Suddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance. Zombie-like, Jay and
Silent Bob step to the turntables behind them. Jay puts on headphones and
begins scratching a record. A familiar tune begins.

The Gang watches, perplexed.

Silent Bob whips around, microphone in his hand, and begins to sing.

                                SILENT BOB

HEY, HEY, HEY!!! IT'S FAT ALBERT!

AND I'M GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU!!

AND BILL'S GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO!!

WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN, NOW!

WITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG!

LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER -

WHILE WE DO OUR THANG!

The Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softens
and smiles, adding a slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up.

                                    JAY

NA , NA, NA! GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME!

                                SILENT BOB

(as Fat Albert)

HEY! HEY! HEY!

                                    JAY

NA. NA. NA! GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME!

Bethany and Rufus look on. amazed.

                                   RUFUS

I thought she looked familiar.

                                  BETHANY

Who?

                                   RUFUS

(he nods toward the stage)

Serendipity.

Bethany looks to the stage.

The Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question. She wipes sweat from her brow.

INT. MOOBY CORP. BOARDROOM - DAY

Oh, this isn't your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby,
the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on
Barney: sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits in
the middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls are
adorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in a
stupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated statue of
the insipid creature.

Doors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men, one woman. They
chatter and take their seats. After a beat, WHITLAND, the CEO, enters,
taking his place at the head of the conference table.

                                 WHITLAND

Good morning, shoppers.

(slaps a file on table)

Has anyone seen the over-night's?

An anticipatory hush fills the room.

                                 WHITLAND

We creamed 'em.

A cheer and applause goes up from the group. Whitland smiles.

                                 WHITLAND

(reading from file)

And last night was a rerun, which says to me that with the six months we
have to ready and promote the 'Very Nlooby Christmas' pay-per-view special,
we can produce history-making numbers. The record is held by that
shock-jock's New Year's thing, but I see no reason why our little cash cow
can't supercede those numbers and...

(stops and sniffs the air)

Do I smell onions?

Bartleby and Loki sit behind the thrall on a black leather couch. Loki is
carving something out of an onion, while Bartleby looks on.

Whitland and the rest of the board stare at them.

                                 WHITLAND

I didn't realize we had guests. Who are these gentlemen with?

The other suits shrug and look to one another for an answer nobody has.

                                 WHITLAND

(to Bartleby and Loki)

Excuse me.

Loki continues carving. Bartleby looks at his friend and shakes his head.
Loki lifts his head without looking up.

                                   LOKI

(very distracted)

Hmm?

                                 WHITLAND

May I ask what you're doing in my boardroom?

                                   LOKI

(still preoccupied)

My friend just has a few words for you, and then we'll be on our way.
Heading to Jersey, you see. Now -by the decor, I assume I'm guessing
correctly that this is the corporate headquarters for Mooby Productions
International?

                                 WHITLAND

You guess correctly. Now, may I ask who the fuck you are and - again - what
the fuck you're doing in our conference room?

                                   LOKI

(to Bartleby, still not looking up)

You may proceed, mon ami'.

                                 BARTLEBY

I can't believe you.

(to Whitland)

I just want to start off by apologizing. My friend here has a penchant
toward the dramatic, so he's making me do this. Usually, I don't even
involve myself in his affairs, but he hasn't done this in awhile, so he
wants...

                                   LOKI

(frustrated)

Just read 'em their rights already.

                                 BARTLEBY

(sighs; circling the table)

Mooby, the Golden Calf. Created by Nancy Goidruff -a former kindergarten
teacher - in nineteen eighty nine to fill a gap in the Saturday morning
schedule on local network K-REL Bought by the Complex Corporation in
nineteen ninety one and broadcast nationally as the 'The Mooby Fun-Time
Hour', it picked up a large following of children, ages three to eight, and
spawns sixteen records, two theatrical films, eight prime-time specials, a
library of priced-to-own video cassettes, and bicoastal theme parks dubbed
'MoobyWorld'.

(beat)

Did I miss anything?

Whitland and company stare for a beat.

                                 WHITLAND

You forgot 'Mooby Magazine'. Is there a point to this?

                                 BARTLEBY

(grimly)

You and your board are idolators.

Whitland and company stare dumbfounded. Loki finishes carving and stands
beside Bartleby.

                                   LOKI

(to Bartleby)

How could your forget the magazine?

Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki turns to the Whitland and holds up the
sculpture.

                                   LOKI

It's you.

(sets sculpture on table)

Do you know much about voo-doo? Fascinating practice, very close to
Satanism, but not really much of a religion - no doctrine of faith. Just an
arrangements of superstitions, the most well- known of which is the voo-doo
doll.

(sneezes; waits; continues)

A mock-up of an individual is subjected to various pokes and prods, and the
desired result is that the individual will feel the effects.

                                 WHITLAND

(to nearest board member)

Call security - now.

Loki throws the knife at the table, severing the phone cord.

                                   LOKI

All lines are currently down.

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Whitland)

Again -. I apologize for my friend's...

                                   LOKI

(frustrated)

Would you just get on with it?!

                                 BARTLEBY

(miffed; to Whitland)

You are responsible for raising an icon that draws worship from the Lord.
You've broken the first commandment, but more than that, I'm afraid none of
you passes for a decent human being. Your continued existence is a mockery
of morality.

(looks to Loki; Loki nods)

Like you - Mister Bernard.

(stands behind board member)

Last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years, eight times - twice
with prostitutes. You even had sex with her best friend while she was at
her garden club meeting and you were supposed to be watching your kids.

                                   LOKI

In the bed you and your wife share, no less.

The board member stares in disbelief. Loki nods to Bartleby and he moves
on.

                                  BARTLBY

And you, Mister Newman.

Loki sifts through compact discs. He pulls out one entitled 'Mooby Mania'
and pops it into a player. A simple children's song echoes through the
room.

                                 BARTLEBY

You got your girlfriend drunk at last year's Christmas party, and then paid
a kid from the mailroom to have sex with her while she was passed out, just
so you could break up with her - guilt free - when she sobbingly confessed
the next morning that she cheated on you. She killed herself three months
later. You sent flowers to her wake.

The board member's face is frozen. Bartleby shakes his head and moves
quickly around the table.

                                 BARTLEBY

(not liking his job)

Mister Pereira disowned his gay son; Mister Turran put his mother in a
third-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her house to
purchase an oriental rug for himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipines
on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy; Mister
Bloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe
and toxic materials because it was less costly.

Bartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her, relieved.

                                 BARTLEBY

You, on the other hand, are an innocent. You lead a good life and have
never misused your power here.

She stares at Bartleby. Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby on.

                                 BARTLEBY

But you, Mister Whitland. You have more skeletons in your closet than this
assembled party. I can't even mention them aloud.

Bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitland's ear.
Whitland goes green. Bartleby steps back. Loki stands beside Whitland.

                                   LOKI

You're her father, you sick fuck.

Whitland begins sobbing.

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Loki)

Can I go now?

                                   LOKI

(cheerily rubbing his head)

Go on, you crazy kid.

Bartlebv exits. Loki turns menacingly on the others.

                                   LOKI

With the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not a decent human being amongst
you. Do you know what makes a human being decent?

(beat)

Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to fear
anymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding behind
your false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even from
one another. But not from God.

Loki goes to exit but pauses. He turns around.

                                   LOKI

I forgot my little voo-doo doll.

(looks at Whitland)

Wow. It really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough...

Loki begins moaning menacingly, slowly waving an open palm over the figure.
Whitland looks at it horrified, then at Loki, then back at the figure. He
sweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure. Loki lets out a
shriek and smashes the figure with his fist. Whitland freezes, eyes closed.
Slowly, he opens his eyes - unharmed.

                                   LOKI

I don't believe in voo-doo.

Loki swiftly exits. The Board Members sit in awed silence. Then the doors
burst open and Loki storms back in.

                                   LOKI

But I do believe in this.

Gun blazing, he takes out the male board members, including Whitland, in a
flurry of bullets. The remaining female Board Member covers her head with
her arms. Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair.

                                   LOKI

(smiling)

It's okay. You've done nothing wrong. They were bad men. You are a pure
soul.

She looks at him, terrified. He smiles back. Then his expression hardens.

                                   LOKI

But you didn't say 'God Bless You' when I sneezed.

He quickly puts the gun to her head. She slams her eyes shut.

                                OC BARTLEBY

(cautionary)

Loki!

Loki freezes and looks OC. He grimaces and holsters his piece.

                                   LOKI

(to woman)

Sorry. Force of habit.

He surveys his handiwork and exits. The female Board Member slowly opens
her eyes and looks around.

INT STRIP JOINT - LATER

Jay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table, surrounded by the other
gangsters and Silent Bob. They laugh and chug their '40's.

                                GANG LEADER

(to Gang)

Watch this shit.

(to Jay)

Do it again, G. Do the Mush-mouth.

                                    JAY

(swigs his beer; as 'Mush-mouth')

Hey-buh, Fat-buh, Al-buh-bert.

The Gang laughs hysterically.

                                GANGSTER 1

Fat Albert like a mother fucker and shit!

Bethany, Rufus, and Serendipity huddle around a table further away.

                                   RUFUS

(elated)

I forgot you were down here! How long now?

                                SERENDIPITY

Three years this August. What about you - is this another temporary
expulsion? You and your 'Christ was down' campaign?

                                  BETHANY

What does that mean - another expulsion? I thought you came down here
specifically to help me?

SERENDIPITY

Is that what he told you? Rufus gets thrown out constantly; at least once a
month, ethereal time. They always bring him back, but only after a few days
of peace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric.

                                   RUFUS

(joking)

Artsy-fartsy bitch.

                                SERENDIPITY

Who you calling artsy-fartsy?

                                   RUFUS

(to Bethany)

Serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem.

                                  BETHANY

Let me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left out of the bible because she's
a woman.

                                   RUFUS

The girl's not a woman.

(to Serendipity)

No offense.

                                  BETHANY

Oh, those weren't tits I saw Jay cozying up to?

                                SERENDIPITY

(tugs on boobs)

What, these? You should know better than anyone at this table that tits
don't make a woman.

                                   RUFUS

Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing mother fucker's got tits - don't make him a
woman.

                                SERENDIPITY

Aside from an intuitive knack for accessorizing, what traditionally defines
a woman falls between two things : her legs. But as you can see...

Serendipity stands and unbuttons her jeans, dropping them slightly,
revealing yet another smooth, sexless crotch, quite like Metatron's.

                                SERENDIPITY

I lack definition.

                                  OC JAY

Hey! They're getting a free show!

Serendipity pulls her pants back up and sits down, smiling at the OC party.

                                  BETHANY

(weary)

Oh God. Another angel. Like Metatron.

                                SERENDIPITY

How do you know Metatron?

(to Rufus)

How does she know Metatron?

                                   RUFUS

This is the last Scion.

                                SERENDIPITY

(beat)

You're kidding.

                                   RUFUS

Don't you see the resemblance?

                                SERENDIPITY

(stares at Bethany)

A bit.

(suddenly nervous)

Oh shit. If she's been tapped, then something's up.

                                  BETHANY

I'm confused.

                                   RUFUS

Bethany, Serendipity here isn't technically an angel, nor is she by any
means a human being like I was and you are.

SERENDIPITY

Amen to that.

(swigs her beer and spits it out)

                                  BETHANY

Then who is she?

                                SERENDIPITY

Not who - what. I haven't always been part of the anthropomorphic club. I
used to be an abstract.

                                  BETHANY

Now I'm really lost.

                                   RUFUS

Serendipity's an idea.

                                SERENDIPITY

Try all ideas.

                                  BETHANY

Meaning?

                                SERENDIPITY

I'm a muse, stupid.

Bethany stares at her for a beat, then at Rufus. Rufus nods affirmatively.

                                  BETHANY

I can't take much more of this.

(downs her beer)

                                   RUFUS

(to Serendipity)

She's now met a seraphim, a dead man, and a muse.

You can appreciate her frame of mind.

                                  BETHANY

(to Serendipity)

So you - what - inspire people?

                                SERENDIPITY

What just went down with your friends over there-you don't think they
thought of that themselves? I knew Kane's weak spot for Fat Albert and
passed it along to the boys.

                                   RUFUS

If she hadn't interceded, they'd be chalk lines right now.

                                  BETHANY

You made them sing that song?

                                SERENDIPITY

I offered them a solution out of the hole they dug for themselves.
Thankfully, they took it.

                                  BETHANY

Are you kidding? Those two are so dense, they wouldn't get a good idea if
it was given to them in a specially marked box.

                                SERENDIPITY

Dense people are the most open to suggestion - it's vou so-called
intelligent folks that have a hard time accepting a good idea.

                                   RUFUS

Ain't that the truth.

                                  BETHANY

Prove it. Give me a good idea.

                                SERENDIPITY

If I do, and you accept it, then you'll have confirmation that you are - as
you say - dense.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Alright. So you're a muse. So what kind of people do you inspire - besides
stupid ones?

                                SERENDIPITY

I used to specialize in entertainment - literature, theatre, so forth.

                                  BETHANY

Movies?

                                SERENDIPITY

In some cases, I'd do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch.

                                  BETHANY

What have I seen that you've been involved with?

                                SERENDIPITY

Off the top of my head - everything. Well almost everything. For example:
I'm responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time.

                                  BETHANY

Nine?

                                SERENDIPITY

The one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get in
and he fights them off?

(Bethany nods)

I had nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

                                   RUFUS

Which brings us to the next logical question - what are you doing
stripping?

                                SERENDIPITY

Well you remember why I left, right?

                                   RUFUS

You were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit for
your ideas.

                                SERENDIPITY

And sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turn
out real trash.

(to Bethany)

So I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeks
notice. got a body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make my
fortune.

                                  BETHANY

So what happened?

                                SERENDIPITY

Writer's block.

                                   RUFUS

Writer's block?

                                SERENDIPITY

Can you believe it? Me - a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in front of the
typewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't even write a
grocery list.

                                  BETHANY

What about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them.

                                SERENDIPITY

That's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second,
but I can't keep any for myself. Her quirky sense of humor.

                                  BETHANY

Whose?

                                SERENDIPITY

God's.

                                  BETHANY

You're saying God's a woman.

                                SERENDIPITY

Was there ever a doubt in your mind?

                                  BETHANY

The possibility never presented itself. He's always referred to as a Him.

                                SERENDIPITY

I didn't write it that way My job stops at the idea stage. The person that
holds the pen adds their own perspective, and all the pen-holders were men.
One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in the
editorial process.

                                   RUFUS

Another one's that you can't jerk off.

                                SERENDIPITY

(to Bethany)

See. these being male-dominated times, the Pharisees and High Priests felt
threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling their
fates. so they made sure that She became a He Doesn't stop with God - the
whole book is slanted and gender-biased: a woman's responsible for the
first sin, the fall of man, and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cuts
Sampson's coif of power, a woman asks for the head of John the Baptist.
Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined.

                                  BETHANY

(stunned)

God is a woman...

                                SERENDIPITY

I don't know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that can
create life, just like God created the universe. Who else but a mother
could have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has with
humanity. A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes, so
psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feel
completely comfortable with; and the faithful - both male and female - feel
at ease with God. In time of trial, our first instinct is to implore the
aid of the Almighty, just as when you're a child, the only person who can
make it all better is...

                                  BETHANY

...mom. God, it makes sense.

                                   RUFUS

(to Serendipity)

Shit, you still have a knack for words.

                                SERENDIPITY

Not really useful in my new line of work.

                                   RUFUS

What about that? Why'd you choose stripping?

                                SERENDIPITY

In an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my own.
See, I've been able to fool myself into thinking this isn't stripping, it's
dancing; and at least dancing is artistic. But She won't even give me that
much - the way God designed dance, it's the only creative act which results
in no tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other arts
forms. when the dance is over, there's nothing to show for it - nothing to
save and enjoy... or sell.

(takes a drink)

Believe me, the irony wasn't lost on this muse.

                                   RUFUS

How long are you going to keep this up?

                                SERENDIPITY

Believe me, I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from time
to time. But I'd hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing the
prodigal. And it sucks because I can't stand being flesh anymore -
especially this halfway crap. Not only do I have to take care of the
aesthetic - the showers, the haircutting, the pit-shaving - but I can't
take advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period as an
excuse not to get laid...

(conspiratorily to Bethany)

...the only true boon to having a period, from what I understand.

                                   RLFLS

Well we could sure use your help. We need someone with good ideas. You
remember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby?

SERENDIPITY

Sure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience.

                                   RUFUS

They found a way back.

                                SERENDIPITY

(shocked)

God no. Not the plenary indulgence loop hole?

                                  BETHANY

You know about that?

                                SERENDIPITY

I always knew that thing was a bad idea. Leave it to the Catholics to
destroy existence.

                                   RUFUS

Bethany's Catholic.

                                SERENDIPITY

My condolences.

                                  BETHANY

What do you have against Catholics?

                                SERENDIPITY

Ever been to a Catholic mass?

                                  BETHANY

Once or twice.

                                SERENDIPITY

It's like bad sex - up, down, up, down, kneel, leave.

And the whole time you'd rather be watching t.v.

You people don't celebrate your faith - you mourn it.

                                  BETHANY

So if we're so wrong, then what's the right religion?

                                SERENDIPITY

When are you people going to learn? It's not about right or wrong - it's a
question of faith. It doesn't matter what you believe in - just that you
believe.

Jay and Silent Bob join them, wearing bandannas.

                                    JAY

Look! They made me and Silent Bob part of the gang!

Suddenly, the doors behind them blast open, pouring light into the onc~im
room. A huge figure stands in the doorway, backlit and acting as a sepia
filter - the light and vapors surrounding him are brown.

                                  FIGURE

(deep, gutteral hiss)

Not born... shit into existence.

Our group stares at the OC brute. Jay sniffs the air.

                                    JAY

Who farted?

                                SERENDIPITY

Sweet Christ, someone wants you bad.

                                  BETHANY

What do you mean? What's that smell?

                                   RUFUS

Don't tell me that's who I think it is.

                                SERENDIPITh

The stench should say it all.

                                  BETHANY

Who the hell is it?!

                                SERENDIPITY

An excremental - the Golgothan.

                                  BETHANY

A what?

                                   RUFUS

A shit-demon.

The Golgothan moves slowly from the door, toward the group.

                                  NO-MAN

No... man. ..of...woman.. born...

The Gang join the others. They hold and cover their noses.

                                GANG LEADER

(to Jay; loading his piece)

Friend of your's?

                                    JAY

(to group)

Is this smelly fuck with us?

                                   RUFUS

He's coming for Bethany.

                                    JAY

(to Gang Leader)

Smoke that mother fucker like it ain't no thang!

                                GANG LEADER

I knew I'd get to wax someone today. Represent!

The Gang charges OC, guns blazing, while we hold on the group. Suddenly,
the room is filled with screams and wet, slurpy noises. The group goes from
staring wide-eyed, to shielding themselves. The noise stops and Jay and
Silent Bob look up.

The Gang lay about NoMan in trashed, dead positions. They are covered in
murky, creamy crap - their wide, white eyes frozen in horror. NoMan scoops
a finger-full of muck off the leader and eats it, smiling.

Our heroes start backing up slowly, as to not be noticed.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

I guess we're in charge of the gang now.

                                  BETHANY

What the fuck happened?!?

                                SERENDIPITY

Go for the bar. We might have a few seconds - his short-term memory's for
shit.

                                    JAY

So's the rest of him.

                                   RUFUS

No chance of taking him down?

                                SERENDIPITY

Gee. I don't know. Let's ask the gangstas.

                                   RUFUS

You're right; let's book.

They dash. NoMan snaps to attention and throws it's arm at them, launching
a huge glob of shit through the air.

                                    JAY

(running; seeing it coming)

SHIT!!!

Everyone leaps behind the bar. The shit flies over them and slams against
the mirror above. Immediately, it stretches - Blob-like - over the entire
frame, and burns in an acidic fashion.

Jay stares, horrified.

                                    JAY

Now that... is some powerful shit.

Serendipity pulls at the floor, yanking open a door.

                                SERENDIPITY

Quick! Get in!

Bethany, Rufus, jay and Silent Bob leap into the darkness. Serendipity
follows, pulling the door shut on top of them.

INT BASEMENT

Our heroes cower beneath the floor door.

                                    JAY

What is that thing?

                                SERENDIPITY

You ever hear of Golgotha?

                                  BETHANY

Skull place. The hill where Christ was crucified.

                                SERENDIPITY

(peering above)

Yeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybody
on that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers,
brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, their
bodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in
the process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: the
Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you,
girlie.

Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit drips
through it.

                                  BETHANY

What are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blasting
through that door!

                                SERENDIPITY

Shit's brainless. If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes, he'll forget
what he came for.

Suddenly another drop falls. Then another. Then a steady stream. Silent Bob
taps Rufus and points. Rufus reacts.

                                   RUFUS

(indicating trickling shit)

Looks like it's been taking memory training courses...

                                SERENDIPITY

(off trickle)

JUMP!!!

The five leap from their perch on the steps, just as the doors explode,
dumping a torrent of crap on the steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan
anew. NoMan lumbers toward them. The group, attempting to gain their
bearings on the floor, crawls backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself
off, rolling it around in It's hands.

                                SERENDIPITY

If anybody still remembers any prayers, I suggest you start whipping them
out.

Silent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon. And then,
something occurs to him. He stops backing up and stands. The others
continue moving back.

                                  BETHANY

Bob, get down! Jay!

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

You tubby retard! Get your ass back on the floor!

Silent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothan's path. The demon snarls a
smile, moving ever closer. Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls a
small canister out. He points it at the beast. A mist shoots out into the
face of the Golgothan. It pauses, looking confused. The shitball in It's
hand drops to the floor, and then so does It.

Bethany, Rufus, Serendipity, and Jay climb to their feet and crowd around
Silent Bob. They look to the fallen, unconscious behemoeth, then to Silent
Bob.

                                  BETHANY

(off Bob's canister)

What was that?

Silent Bob holds the can out to them: it's a small, trial size can of Glade
Air Freshener. Jay looks at it, then at Silent Bob.

                                  BETHANY

(reading can)

'Knocks strong odors out.'

                                   RUFUS

Way to go. tubby.

                                  BETHANY

Why would you ever carrs this?

Jay farts. Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass. The others look at
jay.

                                    JAY

What?!

                                   RUFUS

(to Serendipity)

Who has dominion over this thing?

                                SERENDIPITY

Only Lucifer can order a killing. But something doesn't make sense: this
thing never travels alone - with it's intelligence level, Lucifer'd never
allow it. It usually has some kind of backup.

                                   RUFUS

Can you get some answers?

                                SERENDIPITY

I can give it a shot.

                                  BETHANY

What's going on?

                                   RUFUS

Serendipity's going to talk to that demon.

                                    JAY

Cool! Can we watch?

                                SERENDIPITY

Not a good idea. Demon's can wreak havoc on the weak-minded.

                                    JAY

Fuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own
language! See...?

(makes the universal metal sign)

he'd understand this.

                                SERENDIPITY

(shakes her head; to Rufus)

Whoever sent this might send mor~. I suggest you take the princess and get
as far away as possible.

(to Bethany)

I'll do what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here. If there's
anything helpful. I'll get it to you somehow.

                                  BETHANY

(hugs her)

Thank you. And... you're a great dancer.

                                SERENDIPITY

I'm a better juggler.

(to jay and Silent Bob)

You know you're supposed to be prophets. right? Start acting like prophets.
You should have seen that thing coming.

                                    JAY

(to Bethany)

Why the hell are we getting yelled at?!

                                SERENDIPITY

Just watch out for Bethany. Go.

Bethany leads Jay and Silent Bob up the stairs.

                                    JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Man, bitch thinks just 'cause she's good-looking, she can tell us what to
do.

                                  BETHANY

She told me that if you behave, she'll give you head.

                                    JAY

(excited)

Yeah?.

                                  BETHANY

Oh, a demon'd have a field day with you.

Serendipity and Rufus watch them disappear up the steps.

                                  OC JAY

(beat)

Shut up.

                                OC BETHANY

You shut up.

                                SERENDIPITY

(to Rufus)

Nice girl.

                                   RUFUS

Comes from good stock.

                                SERENDIPITY

You haven't told her yet?

                                   RUFUS

Not the right time.

                                SERENDIPITY

How uncanny is the resemblance? Those eves, the lips...

                                   RUFUS

The nails.

Serendipity looks at Rufus. He smiles. She hits him, laughing. He cracks
up.

                                SERENDIPITY

Blasphemer.

Then, the OC Golgothan makes a groggy, grumbling noise.

                                SERENDIPITY

Shit. You'd better go. I'll take care of the trash.

                                   RUFUS

(hugs her)

Good luck.

Rufus runs up the steps. Serendipity tunrs on the Golgothan.

                                SERENDIPITY

Alright, Stinky - let's see what you know.

EXT CHURCH -DAY

A suited MAN stands at a podium, addressing a small thrall of reporters.

                                    MAN

And now, to speak on behalf of his Holiness' 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign,
ladies and gentlemen of the press, I give you the driving force behind the
movement - Cardinal Glick.

The reporters clap as CARDINAL GLICK takes to the podium. He strikes one as
more of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his Wayfarers.

                                   GLICK

Thank you, Mister Flanagan - one of this parish's chief patrons, who
donated the stained-glass likeness of Our Lady of Gleeful Misery that
welcomes you as you enter the church every Sunday.

(off index cards)

Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the Catholic Church
has fallen behind somewhat in the times. Catholicism usually strikes the
average person as an old-fashioned remedy for the ills - both moral and
psychological - of a society that has since left it's stringent rules and
ornate rituals on the heap with 45's and eight track cassettes. And in an
effort to disprove that, the Church has appointed this year as a time of
renewal, both of faith and of style. So, it is with great pleasure, that I
present you and your parish - mere days away from it's centennial
celebration - and the continental United States, via Satellite with the
first of man revamps that the 'Catholicism -Wow!' campaign will unveil over
the next year.

                                (applause)

Now, what does this mean for the average church-goer? Are we going to throw
out the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our faith? No.
We're simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the aesthetic
and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highest
membership numbers on the planet.

A few applause ring out. Glick smiles.

                                   GLICK

Thank you, thank you. So what are we talking about here. Well, for
example...

(pulls out crucifix)

while it has been a time-honored and traditional symboL of our faith, we
have decided to retire the highly recognizable, yet wholely depressing
symbol of our Lord, Jesus Christ, crucified. Why? Well, look at it. Would
you relish being a member of a group that uses a man nailed to two pieces
of wood as it's masthead? Of course not - who would? I've got enough
downers in my daily routine without having to deal with this visual
everytime I go to worship. lnstead, the church is going to adopt this new,
more soothing and inspiring sigil, which we feel is in-line with our new
outlook.

Glick pulls a cover off an object to his right - a two foot figure of
Christ smiling and giving the 'thumbs up'. The crowd buzzes.

                                   GLICK

See? Isn't this better? How could you not feel just great walking into a
church and seeing this behind the priest - a positive reinforcement that
whatever we do, God thinks is 'a~kay'. I love this thing, it's so...

                                REPORTER I

(interupting)

Cardinal Glick - has the church given any thought to it's position on john
Doe Jersey? Will he be given the right to die with dignity?

Another buzz rises from the crowd. Glick rolls his eyes.

                                   GLICK

C'mon people. We're not here to talk about that. It's an issue we stand
firm on - euthanasia is a big no-no, just like abortion. Murder's murder.
Why won't you people accept that? Besides, we're here to talk about this
little guy - your friend and mine... the happy Jesus. Can't you just see it
on chains around people's necks, and as the new background in avant garde,
MTV videos?

INT BUS TERNIINAL - DAY

The image of the 'Happy jesus' - thumbs up and all - is captured on a t.v.
monitor, a label reading U\'E VIA SATELLITE - RED BANK. NEW JERSEY' at the
bottom of the screen. Bartleby and Loki look up at it, then at one another.

                                   LOKI

And you say Siskel and Ebert have no influence over this culture.

                                 BARTLEBY

We're getting out of here at just the right time. These people are nuts.

                                   LOKI

(off t.v.)

And that's the church we're heading to?

                                 BARTLEBY

(steps to ticket window)

If you want to go home...

(to WOMAN in window)

Two tickets to New Jersey, please.

                                   WOMAN

Jersey's sold out, sir.

                                 BARTLEBY

Are you sure?

                                   WOMAN

The computer says.

                                   LOKI

Come on - how many people can possibly be going to New Jersey?

                                   WOMAN

Enough to fill a bus.

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Loki)

You had to drag that judgement out. You couldn't just hit and run.

(to Woman)

When's the next one?

                                   WOMAN

Same time tomorrow.

                                 BARTLEBY

What?! Doesn't this place warrant at least two buses a day?

                                   WOMAN

I take it you've never been to the Garden State. Next.

Bartleby and Loki look around.

                                   LOKI

There's no one else here.

                                   WOMAN

Then I guess it's lunch time.

(she shuts her window)

                                   LOKI

We should have learned to drive a long time ago. Infinite celestial power
and we can't catch a bus.

                                 BARTLEBY

Just shut up, this is your fault.

                                   LOKI

You can either lament over our mass transit folly, or you can listen to my
suggestion.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's your suggestions that prevent us from negotiating what should be a
simple matter of catching or staying on a bus!

                                   LOKI

Why fall victim to gravity when we can just as easily rise above?

                                 BARTLEBY

(stares at him)

Fly?

                                   LOKI

We got wings, right? Let's use them.

                                 OC VOICE

I wouldn't suggest that.

The pair spin and gawk.

AZRAEL leans in the doorway. He removes his hat, revealing two stubby
horns.

                                  AZRAEL

You wouldn't want to stand out, now would you?

INT STRIP JOINT BASEMENT - DUSK

NoMan is tied to a chair in the middle of the floor. Serendipity draws a
circle around him with lipstick. Once finished. she takes a glass of water
and throws it into No Man's face. It roars to life. The Golgothan shakes of
his daze, turning his attention on Serendipity.

                                   NoMAN

The Muse. They told us you were up here.

                                SERENDIPITY

Matter of perspective. NoMan. I like to think of it as 'down here'. I have
a few questions for you, sir.

                                   NoMan

Free us from these binds, that you may have answers.

                                SERENDIPITY

(heads toward it)

Okay.

(stops; sarcastic)

Oh wait. I'm smarter than that.

NoMan lets out a bellow.

                                SERENDIPITY

Face it, big guy - I'm not releasing you until I get answers. This can go
hard or easy. The sooner I get what I want, the sooner you'll be free. Now,
you can start by telling me why you're on this plane?

                                   NoMAN

(beat)

Liquidate the Last Scion.

                                SERENDIPITY

See? That wasn't so hard. Now - who sent you? Was it Lucifer?

NoMan laughs in a sinister fashion.

                                   NoMAN

Our master is no one and all. For a time, he will be prince of this world -
and the fate of those who dwell in it will be at the mercy of his whimsy.
And then he will sever reality and crush existence, like a thumb punctures
a fontanell, giving peace to those who've been without for so long.

                                SERENDIPITY

Did Bartleby and Loki send you?

                                   NoMAN

Resist no further, Muse. Deliver over to us the conflicted one, that this
world may die screaming. No power - divine or inherited - threatens the
crusade. You cannot win. Soon will rise of the cry of the abandonned,
begging your God to put an end to the madness. And only as being becomes
not, will they know that the God of Abraham lay dormant while the dream
perished in a blink. Your God is not dead - He's brain dead.

                                SERENDIPITY

She, you chauvinist bastard - She's brain dead. And no She's not. Stop
trying to be so spooky. Tell me who sent vou, or I'll use whatever
influence I have below' to make Hell even worse for you.

                                   NoMAN

You speak of Azrael.

(he laughs)

We pity you. Muse. You're still playing the old game. The one that could
have made good on your threat is gone.

                                SERENDIPITY

What do you mean. gone? He escaped?

                                   NoMAN

No soul escapes Hell, but one.

(beat - as if It's heard something)

Would that I could cross the threshold of your confining circle, I would
crush your half-life throat. But my Master does not abandon me to this
mockery of a prison. We will come back for the girl. And when we do, it
will take more than fragrant mist to keep our hands from crushing her head.

NoMan goes stiff and then limp. His body begins to melt.

INT TOY STORE - DAY

Azrael leads Bartleby and Loki through the aisles, passing tons of stuffed
animals.

                                 BARTLEBY

Jesus Christ, Azrael - how'd you get out of Hell?

                                  AZRAEL

I told them I was coming up on a routine possession. I don't have much
time. If they figure out my ruse, they'll come looking for me.

                                 BARTLEIBY

You lied?

                                   LOKI

Go figure. Him. A demon.

(to Azrael)

Why'd you bring us in here?

                                  AZRAEL

Because you two fucks are inches away from getting yourselves caught. Going
around killing people, about to uncase your wings... don't you have any
idea what's going on?

                                   LOKI

We're going back home.

                                  AZRAEL

Are you so clueless as to think you can just waltz back into Heaven?

                                 BARTLEBY

Why not? We're going back clean.

                                  AZ RAEL

Let me let you in on a little secret, okay: everyone is looking for you.
Both sides - above and below. The orders are to terminate you on sight.

                                 BARTLEBY

(shocked)

Why?

                                  AZRAEL

You're pissing people off, that's why! Word on the grapevine is that God's
pissed off at your presumption, and I know Lucifer's pissed because you
assholes might just succeed where he's failed so many times, making him
look bad.

                                 BARTLEBY

So they're going to kill us?!?

                                  AZRAEL

They're going to try'. That's why you have to travel incognito - tone down
your behavior, stay off their respective radars. Go about this thing more
subtly. Quit killing people - that's high profile. And for God's sake,
don't uncase your wings until you have to transubstantiate. Because the
minute you let them flap, legions of thrones and hordes of demons will
fight each other over who gets to kill you first.

(looksOC)

Shhhh!

A WOMAN and her small DAUGHTER walk past. While the Woman looks at the
items on the top shelf, Loki pulls off Azrael's hat and taps the Daughter
on the shoulder. He points to Azrael's horns. The Woman pulls the Daughter
further down the aisle, oblivious to the trio.

                                 DAUGHTER

Mommy, that man had horns.

Azrael grabs his hat and puts it back on.

                                  AZRAEL

That's the kind of shit I'm talking about!

                                   LOKI

Oh, lighten up.

                                 BARTLEBY

(still reeling)

I can't believe they want to kill us.

                                  AZRAEL

Believe it, boys. They've even got the Last Scion looking for you.

                                   LOKI

You're kidding!

                                  AZRAEL

This is big. I'm telling you. Your re-entry is a thorn in a lot of sides,
and they'll stop at nothing to prevent it.

                                   LOKI

If that's the case, then why aren't you hunting for us too?

                                  AZRAEL

Because I want to see you go back. You were both given a raw deal; almost
as raw as mine. If you make it back, then I figure there's hope for me.

(looks around)

In the meantime, I suggest you find an alternate mode of transportation. If
anything else comes up, I'll contact you.

                                 BARTLEBY

Thank you, Azrael. You're a true friend.

                                  AZRAEL

Would you expect anything less from a demon. I have to get back to the Pit,
before they get suspicious.

(turns to leave)

                                   LOKI

Hey Az - what's it like down there. Is it as bad as they say?

                                  AZRAEL

Give you a hint: they've been playing 'Mrs. Doubtfire' continuously for two
years now.

(looks at Bartleby)

Shit man - that is punishment.

EXT CONTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The Train chugs through the darkness.

INT TRAIN - NIGHT

Bethany and Rufus sit across from one another. They stare out the window.

                                   RUFUS

How you coping, kid?

                                  BETHANY

It's weird. just when I think I've got a handle on things. something
wholely unbelievable presents itself. Sometimes I wish I had just stayed
home.

                                   RUFUS

You sound like the Man.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

What was He like?

                                   RUFUS

Jesus? Black.

                                  BETHANY

Besides that.

                                   RUFUS

The brother was centered. I mean, He was God, right? But I think He felt
left out because He was more than human, you know? We used to sit around
the fire - me and the other guys - and we'd be talking about what ass-holes
the Romans were or getting laid...

                                  BETHANY

Some things never change.

                                   RUFUS

...and He'd just sit there listening and smiling. We'd ask Him why He never
joined in the convo, but He said He just liked to hear us talk; about
anything. Said it was like music. I think He just wished He had unimportant
shit to talk about himself.

                                  BETHANY

How does He feel now?

                                   RUFUS

He still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to see the shit that gets
carried out in His name - wars, bigotry, but especially the factioning of
all the religions. He said humanity took a good idea and, like always,
built a belief structure on it.

                                  BETHANY

Having beliefs isn't good?

                                   RUFUS

I think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a
belief is trickier. Life should malleable and progressive; working from
idea to idea permits that. Beliefs anchor you to certain points and limit
growth; new ideas can't generate. Life becomes stagnant. That was one thing
the Man hated - still life. He wanted everyone to be as enthralled with
living as He was. Maybe it had

something to do with knowing when He was going to die. but Christ had this
vitality that I've never encountered in another person since. You know what
I'm saving?

                                  BETHANY

He was big on life?

                                   RUFUS

It was more than that. He was the only person I ever knew who never engaged
in that most ancient of life-affirming activities.

                                  BETHANY

Sex.

                                   RUFUS

Debate. That's the only way people know how to reaffirm that they're alive
- by debating. In all it's forms. People spend their whole lives debating:
we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight
each other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights. We
believe that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and give
up. People say that life's a struggle, but it's not. Life is living. I'm
even guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity,
fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the only
way I know how to live is through debate. That's sad, isn't it?

                                 BETIIANY

Not if you believe it's important for people to know.

                                   RUFUS

A belief's a dangerous thing, Bethany. People die for it. People kill for
it. The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the Catholic
Belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit. And whether
they know it or not, Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief, and if
they're successful, you, me. all of this... ends in a heartbeat.

(beat)

All over a belief.

Bethany nods. Rufus looks around.

                                   RUFUS

I haven't seen the moron twins in awhile.

                                  BETHANY

They went to the lounge car to smoke.

(getting up)

I'll go find them; make sure they're not getting into any trouble.

                                   RUFUS

I'm going to catch a few z's. Forgot how tiring living can be.

Bethanv heads off Rufus looks out the window, then shuts his eyes.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany enters and spots jay and Silent Bob, talking to an unseen party.

                                  BETHANY

You two aren't getting into any trouble, are you?

                                    JAY

Nope. Just about to smoke a bowl with our new friends. You in?

                                  BETHANY

And who are your new friends?

                                    JAY

They just got in at the last stop.

Silent Bob moves over, revealing the new friends.

                                    JAY

This is Larry and Barry.

Bartleby and Loki smile at Bethany.

                                   LOKI

Jay tells us you're going to sleep with him.

EXT TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train rushes over head.

INT LOUNGE CAR - LATER

Loki, Jay, and Silent Bob pass a joint under the table and take quick hits,
trying to remain casual. Jay pounds the table happily.

Bartleby and Bethany lay on either side of the table in their booth.

                                  BETHANY

You can smoke up with them if you want. You don't have to keep me company.

                                 BARTLEBY

It's a long trip. There'll be plenty of time later.

(beat)

So why are you heading to Jersey?

                                  BETRANY

There's just this thing there I'm supposed to do. How about you?

                                 BARTLEBY

We're going home.

                                  BETHANY

Do you two live together?

                                 BARTLEBY

Unfortunately. Do you live with those guys?

                                 B ETHANY

God, no. Not they just sort of adopted me.

                                 BARTLEBY

They're funny as hell. The big one never says a word.

                                  BETHANY

I wish the little one would take a cue from him. But they're okay, as far
as stoner's go.

                                 BARTLEBY

Lo... Larry's taken an immediate shine to them, and he usually hates
people.

                                 BETIIANY

How long've you two been together?

                                 BARTLEBY

Awhile. He's great company. He can be a little flaky sometimes, but we've
got a lot in common.

                                  BETHANY

How'd you meet?

                                 BARTLEBY

We were stationed together.

                                  BETHANY

See? That's beautiful. And everyone's always up-in-arms about this
'out-in-the-military' issue.

                                 BARTLEBY

What do you mean?

                                  BETHANY

Well there's all that macho bullshit about it being 'This Man's Army'. And
you two meet and hook up while in the service, which is so special -
because it's so hard to meet anyone you can seriously relate to...

                                 BARTLEBY

(catches on)

You think we're lovers?! Oh no. No, we're not gay.

                                  BETHANY

(laughs)

Oh God, I'm sorry'. I just assumed...

                                 BARTLEBY

No. We live together and all, but at the end of the night, I go to my room.
and he goes to his.

(beat)

Why? Do I come off as gay?

                                  BETHANY

(laughing)

No, not at all. I'm sorry. My ex-husband kind of fouled up my relationship
awareness barometer.

                                 BARTLEBY

You're divorced?

                                  BETHANY

That's the nice way of putting it. I consider it being dumped.

                                 BARTLEBY

I was dumped once. More or less.

                                  BETHANY

It's terrible, isn't it? Don't you constantly question your value - like
why was I so easy to cast aside? Didn't I have merit?

                                 BARTLEBY

And you wonder if the other party's going to come to their senses and call
you back.

                                 BETIIANY

The worst is that I still think like a couple. After all these years, I
still have the 'we' mentality.

                                 BARTLEBY

Mine grew out of what was really a stupid misunderstanding. A
misunderstanding that grew into a total withdrawl of communication.
Abandonment. And even though it was years ago, there's not a day that goes
by that I don't wonder what went wrong. And then it hits me - I was
replaced by someone. A lot of someones.

                                 BET HANY

And they always tell you it'll hurt less with time...

                                 BARTLEBY

...when actually, it hurts more.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

You know what we need? We need some drinks. A lot of drinks. Do you agree?

                                 BARTLEBY

Whole-heartedly.

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus continues to slumber.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Jay is asleep on Silent Bob's shoulder, drooling slightly. Loki talks with
Silent Bob.

                                   LOKI

I'm telling you, man - it's all about organized religion and society's
battle against it. The Rebels are fighting the Empire, right? Now the
Empire is led by whom? Darth Vader? No. It's led by the Emperor. And the
Emperor is a practitioner of the Force, albeit the Dark Side of the Force.
And the Force is basically a religion.

(Silent Bob nods)

So the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule, and the Imperial government is
run by this old religion. What you have, then, is a theocratic government -
a government run by the church. So Luke, Han, and Leia are fighting that
government to liberate the galaxy from the pious grip of what is, in
essence, holy mother church.

Silent Bob nods in understanding.

Bethany and Bartleby slump in their booth, the table loaded with empty
glasses. Bethany is quite tipsy. Bartleby sips his drinks, and
surreptitiously spits it out.

                                 BARTLEBY

You're saying you still go to church?

                                  BETHANY

(laughs)

Every Sunday.

                                 BARTLEBY

Does it do anything for you?

                                  BETHANY

(thinks)

Gives me time to balance my check book every week.

                                 BARTLEBY

See? That's what I'm talking about. People don't go to church and feel
spiritual. They go to church and feel bored. But they keep going. Every
week. Out of habit.

                                  BETHANY

Or in habit, if you're a nun.

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh... that wasn't very funny at all.

                                  BETHANY

A friend of mine told me that church is like bad sex:it's messy and there's
no foreplay...

(starts laughing)

No. that's not it. I am so buzzed.

                                 BARTLEBY

When do you think you lost your faith?

                                  BETHANY

I remember the exact moment. I was on the phone with my mother, and she was
trying to counsel me through what was happening to me and my marriage. And
she said something like "There's always a plan." And I... just got so
angry. I mean, I know she was talking about God, right - God had a plan.
But I was like "What about my plans?" You know? Like, don't they count for
anything? I had planned to grow old with my husband and have a family -
wasn't that plan good enough for God?

(beat)

Apparently not.

(swigs her drink)

How about you? When did you lose your faith?

                                 BARTLEBY

Me? Years ago. One day, God just stopped listening. I kept talking, but I
got the distinct impression that He wasn't listening anymore.

                                  BETHANY

She. And how do you know She was listening in the first place?

                                 BARTLEBY

(thinks)

I guess I don't.

                                  BETHANY

I hate thoughts like that. But they occur to you with age. When you're a
kid, you never question the whole faith thing - God's in Heaven, and
He's... She's always got her eye on you. I'd give anything to feel that way
again. Which is why I guess I let myself get talked into this pilgrimage. I
needed proof. And the opportunity presented itself to find out if it is
like they told us in Catholic school. And I gotta tell you - the last few
days, I've come across some interesting people that lend toward convincing
me.

                                 BARTLEBY

Where's this pilgrimage to?

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus stirs. He looks around and stretches.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany and Bartleby continue their discussion.

                                  BETHANY

You'd never believe me if I told you.

                                 BARTLEBY

Try me.

                                  BETHANY

Alright. But I warned you. Okay - I'm going to this church in New Jersey.

                                 BARTLEBY

Really...

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus heads toward the back of the car. He opens the door between the cars
and exits.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany and Bartleby talk further. Bartleby's intrigued.

                                  BETHANY

I was told that I'm supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering the
church. They're trying...

(laughing)

This sounds so stupid... They're trying to get back into Heaven.

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus passes through another car and opens the door at the end.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bartleby grows very tense. Bethany rattles on, half-toasted.

                                  BETHANY

See, they got tossed out of Heaven years ago, right? And if they get back
in, it proves God wrong. And since God is infallible, to prove Her wrong
would...

(laughing hard)

..would unmake existence! I feel so stupid just saying it.

Bartleby's eyes are wide. He looks scared. Then, a calm falls over him.

                                  BETRANY

(laughing)

But the thing I don't get... is how do I stop an angel? Two, even! I guess
I'm supposed to talk them out of it or something.

Bartleby surreptitiously slides a knife off the table.

                                 BARTLEBY

Maybe you're supposed to kill them?

Bethany breaks into hysterics.

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus pulls open another door and exits.

INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethany's still cracking up, oblivious to the on-the-defensive Bartleby.

                                  BETHANY

Oh yeah! Kill them! Even if that was the case... I mean. how do you kill an
angel?

                                 BARTLEBY

I don't imagine it's much different...

(slowly lifts the knife)

...from killing a human...

The door behind them slides open. Rufus steps in.

                                   RUFUS

Where the hell is everybody? I wake up, and...

He sees Bartleby. They both freeze.

                                 BARTLEBY

The Apostle!

                                   RUFUS

Holy shit!

                                  BETHANY

(stumbling to her feet)

Rufus, I want you to meet my friend, Barry...

Bartleby leaps out of the booth and grabs Bethany, holding the knife to her
throat.

                                  BETHANY

(chuckiing)

Barry! Don't be such a show off!

                                   RUFUS

Take it easy, Bartleby. Just let her go and let's talk about this.

                                 BARTLEBY

After all this time, this is what it comes down to -slaughtered by this
meat puppet?!

                                   RUFUS

There doesn't have to be a slaughter. We can work this out...

                                  BETHANY

Is that a knife?

                                 BARTLEBY

Oh. we can work it out, alright. I'm going to work the blade in and out of
her thorax!

(calling over shoulder)

Loki!

Loki catches the action and reacts.

                                   LOKI

Holy shit - the Apostle!

He leaps from the table. Jay stirs and wakes up.

                                    jAY

(half asleep)

I didn't come in you, I swear...

(looks around)

Bartleby, with Bethany in hand, faces off against Rufus. Loki joins them.

                                   LOKI

(to Rufus)

What are you doing here?

                                 BARTLEBY

They're here to thwart our journey home, my friend. This one just told me
that she's supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering a church.

                                   LOKI

You think she was talking about us?

                                 BARTLEBY

I'd say there was a pretty good chance. What do you say, Rufus - we're to
be liquidated?

                                   RUFUS

It doesn't have to go down like that! You haven't thought about the
consequences of re-entry!

                                   LOKI

Consequences, schmonsequences.

                                 BARTLEBY

I have to agree with him. No one - not you, and especially not this
finite-lifer - no one is going to impede us. We're going home, regardless
of whose pride it may hurt!

                                   RUFUS

It's not a question of pride, it's...

                                 BARTLEBY

Loki - kill the girl

                                   LOKI

(beat)

What are you, high?

                                 BARTLEBY

Do it!

                                   LOKI

I can't kill her if she hasn't done anything, you know that. And it looks
like she's 'on the job', so to speak...

                                 BARTLEBY

Fine! I'll kill her myself...

A hand lands on Bartleby's shoulder.

                                    JAY

(oblivious to the situation)

Hey man - now it's your turn. We got enough for a fatty boom-batty, biggety
blunt!

Bartleby turns the knife on him.

                                    JAY

(not quite getting it yet)

We having cake or something?

Loki backhands Jay, stunning him.

                                    JAY

(dazed)

In grates...

Jay drops to the floor, out cold. Silent Bob grabs Loki and hurls him down
the aisle. Rufus grabs Bartleby's knife hand. They struggle. Bethany
collapses.

                                   RUFUS

TUBBY! THE DOOR!

Silent Bob jumps over Loki and opens the back door of the car. He grabs
Loki by the collar.

                                   LOKI

Wait, man! Can't we talk about this?!

He throws Loki out the door, off the train.

Rufus squeezes Bartleby's hand. Bartleby drops the knife and punches Rufus
in the face. Bethany jumps on Bartleby's back, covering his eyes. They
careen down the aisle, toward Silent Bob. He pulls Bethany off Bartleby's
back and kicks him out the back door, off the train. He quickly slams the
door closed and leans against it.

The Bartender stares at him.

Silent Bob brushes off his coat and thumbs toward the door.

                                SILENT BOB

No ticket.

Rufus rubs his jaw. Bethany crawls up beside him, breathing heavily.

                                 BETH ANY

I should have known something was wrong when he paid for all the drinks.

INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

A door is kicked open. Loki enters, brushing himself off. Bartleby follows.

                                   LOKI

The Apostle is here!

                                 BARTLEBY

I noticed.

                                   LOKI

If that's the case, then chick with him must be...

                                 BARTLEBY

The Scion, I'd imagine.

(leans against the wall; slides down)

                                   LOKI

(in a panic)

Well, shit man! Maybe we should rethink this whole thing! I mean, you heard
the guy - he said there were consequences. Azrael tells us we're marked.
Maybe there's more to this than we thought about.

Bartleby leans against the wall, sitting on the ground. His demeanor has
changed. He stares into space.

                                 BARTLEBY

There sure is.

(beat)

It's them.

                                   LOKI

(beat)

What?

                                 BARTLEBY

(shakes his head)

Them.

                                   LOKI

(thinks)

The movie about the giant ants?

                                 BARTLEBY

Them - the humans. It's what it all comes down to. you know? Us against
humanity... kind of like that giant ant movie.

                                   LOKI

(beat)

Are you alright?

                                 BARTLEBY

I'm better than alright. I've had an epiphany, my friend.

                                   LOKI

An... epiphany. Yes, well... that'll happen.

                                 BARTLEBY

When that sweet, innocent girl let her mission slip, I suddenly understood
it all - everything. For the first time in all these eons, I get it.

                                   LOKI

(beat)

Get what?

                                 BARTLEBY

In the beginning, it was just us and Him. Angels and God. And then He
created the humans. And He gave them more than He ever gave us. Our's was
designed to be a life of servitude and worship - adoration. But He gave the
humans more - He gave them a choice. They can choose to ignore God, choose
to acknowledge Him. All this time we've been down here, everyday I felt the
absence of the Divine presence. And it pained me... as I'm sure it must
have pained you sometimes, even though you'd gloss over it with jokes. But
we feel his absence, and why? Because of the way He made us -as servants.
Had we been given free will, we could ignore the pain... like them.

                                   LOKI

You know - maybe you should take a nap or something.

                                 BARTLEBY

Loki, don't you get it? It's the humans - it's always the humans. They were
given paradise; they threw it away. They were given this planet; they
destroyed it. They were favored best among all His endeavors; and some of
them don't even believe He exists. Their ego-mania corroded Hell and made
it dark and crimson.

(looks at Loki)

I asked you to lay down your sword years ago - why?

Because I felt sorry for them. And where did it get us?

Thrown out.

(smiles)

We've paid our debt. Don't you think it's time we went home? And to do
that, I think we have to dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

                                   LOKI

Wait, wait, wait - kill them?! You're talking about the Last Scion, for
Christ's sake! And what about Jay and Bob - I mean, those guys were
alright.

                                 BARTLEBY

Don't, my friend. Don't let your sympathies get the best of you, as they
did me way back when. Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, our
sins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul.

                                   LOKI

That sounds thin.

                                 BARTLEBY

Fine. We'll cover ourselves. We'll take out a slew of people. Maybe amidst
the body count, He won't notice.

                                   LOKI

Oh, that's being realistic.

Bartleby reaches out and grabs Loki, slamming him against the wall.

                                 BARTLEBY

I'm going home, Loki. And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is going
to make that otherwise.

Bartleby releases Loki and smiles. He exits. Loki watches him.

                                   LOKI

Shit.

He follows.

EXT CAMP FIRE - NIGHT

Another Newspaper headline regarding 'John Doe Jersey' fills the frame. It
is lowered to reveal Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshift
fire in the middle of nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads the
paper.

                                  BETHANY

I don't understand why we couldn't stay on the train. You threw those guys
off.

                                   RUFUS

A very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't be
there.

                                  BETHANY

And what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, for
God's sake!

                                    JAY

He had the knife at your throat. To gut you, he'd have to have the knife at
your stomach.

                                  BETHANY

Semantics! Semantics that don't even answer mv question.

                                   RUFUS

Well, I know I'd perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy.

                                  BETHANY

What do you mean, kill? I wasn't asked to kill them -just stop them from
going into that church.

                                   RUFUS

And how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo?

                                  BETHANY

I've never killed anything before in my life!

                                    JAY

I'll do it.

                                   RUFUS

Shut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, let
alone an angel.

                                    JAY

Fuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy.

                                   RUFUS

Oh yeah? How' would you do it?

                                    JAY

I'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see that
flick?

                                   RUFUS

(ignoring jay; to Bethany)

Killing an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off their
wings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same as
killing anything else - head or heart, take your pick.

                                  BETHANY

You say it as if it's easy.

                                   RUFUS

(oblivious to Jay)

Problem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. All
this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker -
and those guys felt far from weak. Either that or someone's protecting them
- someone with juice.

                                  BETHANY

So then we're screwed?

(shrugs)

Shit, that's the best news l've heard in days.

                                   RUFUS

This doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them.

                                  BETHANY

Count me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - both
psychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick back
and wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctor
ordered.

                                    JAY

I'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die.

                                   RUFUS

What are you babbling about now?

                                    JAY

If I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go on
living, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd be
okay, because I know I'm not missing anything.

                                  BETHANY

See? You know it's right when even he's making sense.

                                    JAY

Besides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in
like five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob.

                                   RUFUS

So you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and
history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid?

                                    JAY

(thinks)

No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid.

                                  BETHANY

Now that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finally
know - why me?

                                    JAY

Because you've got nice tits.

                                  BETHANY

I wasn't talking to you!

(to Rufus)

Why me? Why do I have to do this? Nobody's come

clean on that. Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet. How come I
got tapped?

Rufus looks at her. He shrugs.

                                   RUFUS

Family ties.

                                    JAY

That show's funny as hell.

                                   RUFUS

Shut up.

(to Bethany)

Do you know what the Apocryphal books are?

Bethany shakes her head no.

                                   RUFUS

Most of that information in the Bible came from the Dead Sea Scrolls -
ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago. And when the Sanskrit was
translated, they discovered data that conflicted with the lore church
officials had already established as the basis of their religion. They
couldn't refute centuries of dogma, so they thought it best to leave
certain passages out - sometimes whole books. Those books make up the
Apocrypha.

                                  BETHANY

What's this have to do with me?

                                   RUFUS

You've never gotten the complete picture. If they had compiled the material
together like they were supposed to, you'd get the whole story. But by
leaving text out, the church has presented you people with an extremely
sterile and unmoving account of religious history. The Creation. the entire
Old Testament, the history of Christ...

(let's her take it in)

Forget about my whole black angle for a minute...

                                    JAY

We might if you'd quit bringing it up.

Rufus backhands Jay. Silent Bob holds jay back. Rufus continues, oblivous
to Jay.

                                   RUFUS

He goes from twelve years old to thirty. Whole volumes of text about the
eighteen year struggle with His Divine nature prior to His acceptance of it
were thown out, forever lost to the faithful.

                                  BETHANY

I don't buy it. Integral material like that would give people a better
understanding of the nature of God. Why leave it out?

                                   RUFUS

Because it was all closely tied in with His family.

                                  BETHANY

His mother and father?

                                   RUFUS

His brothers and sisters.

                                  BETHANY

(beat)

Wait, wait, wait - Jesus didn't have any brothers or sisters. Mary was a
virgin - that's why it's called the Immaculate Conception.

                                   RUFUS

Mary gave birth to Christ without having known a man's touch - that's true.
But she did have a husband. And do you really think he'd have stayed
married to her all those years if he wasn't getting laid? The nature of God
and the Virgin Birth - those are leaps of faith. But believing a wife never
humped her husband - that's just gullibility.

                                  BETHANY

(sudden realization)

MARY AND JOSEPH HAD SEX?!?

                                   RUFUS

All the time, from what I understand. Jesus used to tell me stories about
hearing them through the walls when He was a kid.

(beat)

So you ask why you got tapped. I'll tell you why: a Christ was the
salvation of this world once before. And you're the closest thing to a
Christ that still walks.

                                  BETHANY

Meaning?

                                   RUFUS

The blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at the
genetic level with the man you call Jesus.

(hand on her shoulder)

You're His great-grand-niece.

Bethany's jaw drops. A high-pitched squeak of a word escapes her lips.

                                    JAY

(takes a hit from his joint)

So... that would make Bethany part black.

(to Silent Bob)

Man, this is just like when Vader told Luke he was his father.

                                   RUFUS

I just wish I knew what the hell we're supposed to do now?

                                 OC VOICE

You must go to the Dagobah system and find Yoda - the Jedi Master who
instructed me.

Everyone turns around. Metatron leans against a tree.

                                 METATRON

God. l've always wanted to say that.

                                   RUFUS

The voice.

                                 NIETATRON

(mimicking his shock)

The Apostle!

(sits down with them)

                                  BETHANY

Now you show up! Where were you when that psychotic bastard had a knife to
my throat?

                                 METATRON

I told you you'd be in capable hands - you're not dead are you?

                                   RUFUS

What are you doing here anyw'ay?

                                 METATRON

I felt left out. Everyone's sitting around coming clean, I thought I'd join
in with a confession of mine own.

                                    JAY

Now who's this mother fucker?

                                   RUFUS

This is the Voice of God - show some respect.

                                    JAY

The Voice of God? Where's the rest of Him?

                                 METATRON

Funny you should mention that - we're not sure.

                                  BETHANY

Excuse me?

                                 METATRON

Didn't it ever occur to you that this Bartleby/Loki situation was well
within the realm of His control?

                                   RUFUS

If that's the case, then why was Bethany tapped?

                                 METATRON

You know those constitutionals He likes to take?

                                  BETHANY

Constitutionals?

                                   RUFUS

I think we're beyond euphemisms at this point.

(to Bethany)

God's a skee-ball fanatic.

                                 METATRON

Let's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright?

(to Bethany)

Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years -
He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyone
where He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quite
understandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been proven
as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what I
understand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children.
Isn't that sweet?

                                  BETHANY

But She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you're
getting at?

                                 METATRON

(to Rufus)

'She'? I take it she's met the Muse.

(to Bethany)

No, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her.

                                   RUFUS

Maybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback.

                                M ETAT RON

No - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has
set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite
well-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to be
killed in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody
knew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion
- He's trapped in a body.

                                   RUFUS

So God's not dead...

                                    JAY

He's brain dead.

                                 METATRON

So it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit that
we're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people looking
everywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able to
smoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves.

                                   RUFUS

Can it be Lucifer?

                                 METATRON

Thankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. I
know they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd have
made his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible for
Bartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return as
everyone else.

                                   RUFUS

Then what about the Golgothan and the Triplets?

                                 METATRON

Don't be stupid - demons aren't exclusive to Hell. Anybody can summon one.

                                    JAY

(excited)

Yeah?

Silent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points. Jay reads.

                                  BETHANY

Don't encourage them. And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as a
test?

                                 METATRON

No, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough -
how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of God
belonged on the back of a milk carton?

                                   RUFUS

So what do we do now?

                                M ETAT RON

I say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas.

                                    JAY

(off paper)

Why don't we just ask this guy to close the church?

                                 METATRON

I beg your pardon?

                                    JAY

Here.

(hands group the paper)

                                  BETHANY

(reading)

'Glick Takes Heat for Campaign'?

                                    JAY

It's the guy in charge of the church thing.

                                  BETHANY

(reading)

'Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and
questionable direction of his church-sanctioned 'Catholicism - Wow!'
campaign. When asked about his motivations for decommisioning the
traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed Olympic sized
lap-pools beneath parish floors, Click responded "Come on - who doesn't
like a pool party?"

                                    JAY

Maybe you could tell him to shut down the church. If it's closed on that
day, those guys can't get blessed or whatever - right?

                                 METATRON

Good Lord - he's got a point.

                                  BETHANY

I think Silent Bob had a point. But sure - we can go to him and explain the
situation somehow.

                                   RUFUS

'We'? You're back in?

                                  BETHANY

Well, mine is a heritage Divine... and I wouldn't want to let down the

(off Silent Bob)

Well, well, well - the prophets finally live up to their titles.

Silent Bob shrugs. Jay is trying to look down Serendipity's shirt. She
back-hands him.

TELEVISION SCREEN - COMMERCIAL

Two cartoon ALTAR BOYS sift through their bowls of cereal.

                                  ALTAR 1

The same boring cereal again?

A cheesy CARTOON CHRIST floats down from above.

                                  CHRIST

Man cannot live on boring cereal alone!

                                ALTAR I & 2

IT'S JESUS!

Jesus pulls a box of HOSTIES cereal from his sash.

                                  CHRIST

Why not try Hosties!

CL on cereal pouring into a bowl. It's shaped like Eucharistic hosts. Milk
follows.

                                 CHRIST VO

New Hosties is fortified with vitamins and minerals, topped off with an
angelic kiss of frosting that stays crispy in milk!

Christ's hands on their shoulders, the Altar Boys down their cereal
happily.

                                  CHRIST

Hosties is an important part of any nutritious breakfast, and each one is
blessed by a high ranking Vatican Monsignor - good for the body, and good
for the soul. But make sure you've confessed beforehand...

Altar 2 clutches at his throat, gasping.

                                  ALTAR 2

I... I touched... m..myself! I'm...s...sorry...

                                  CHRIST

(smiling benignly)

You're forgiven.

Altar 2 stops choking and continues eating, happily.

                                  CHRIST

So try a bowl of Hosties! And don't just take my word for it...

A cartoon POPE pops out of the box, eating a spoonful of cereal.

                                   POPE

They're Heavenly!

INT CLICK'S OFFICE - DLSK

A hand switches off the t.v. Pan up to Cardinal Click, all smiles.

                                   GLICK

Well...? Doesn't it pop?

Bethany. Rufus, lay and Silent Bob are at a total loss for words.

                                    JAY

(After a long beat)

Does it come in chocolate flavor?

The Cardinal picks up a golf putter and begins putting into an overturned
glass.

                                   GLICK

You see? Now this one's got vision!

(to Jay)

We're rolling out the flavors in September. Big cereal month with the kids,
back to school and all.

                                  BETHANY

It's a bit... startling.

                                   GLICK

Exactly! And that's what we're looking to do - shake these people up a bit,
get them motivated. That's the whole point of the campaign. Mass attendance
is at an all-time low in this country. And it's not like we're losing them
to the Protestants or Baptists - people aren't practicing at any
denomination these days. If we can sell them some show - let 'em know the
Catholic church has some panache, we can win them back -even get some new
ones. Fill them pews, people - that's the key. And cross-promoting - like
with the cereal tie-in grabs the little ones as well. Hook 'em while
they're young.

(sits at his desk, lights smoke)

                                   RUFUS

Kind of like the tobacco industry?

                                   GLICK

Oh - if only we had their numbers. But we are aiming for the same
demographic, even though mine is the soulsaving biz. And if I have to play
a bit of the devil to bring them closer to the Lord, then I'll wear the
cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork.

Jay and Silent Bob adjourn themselves from the group and approach a hat
rack, where the Cardinal's CASSOCK and MITER hang. Jay nudges Silent Bob.

                                OC BFTHANY

We really appreciate you seeing us this late in the day, your Emminence. My
friends and I have been traveling all night in hopes of getting a chance to
talk to you about the Saint Michael's Re-Dedication ceremony.

The Cardinal blows smoke rings.

                                   GLICK

You'd like to help out in some way?

                                  BETHANY

We'd like you to cancel the ceremony and the re

dedication.

                                   GLICK

(pauses mid-ash-tap)

I beg your pardon?

Silent Bob stands alone by the coat rack. Jay leaps into the frame, cassock
tied around his shoulder like a cape. He strikes a Superman pose.

                                OC BETHANY

There's going to be a world of trouble if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward
as planned.

The Cardinal leans back in his chair.

                                   CLICK

What is this - a threat? Are you planning some sort of demonstation?

(pause)

Are you pro-choicers?

                                  BETHANY

No, the trouble's not from us. It's from these renegade angels who've been
stuck on earth since the plagues...

Rufus side-kicks Bethany, nonchalantly.

                                  BETHANY

Uh... these guys who think they're renegade angels.

                                  RUFL'S

See padre, it goes down like this - the boys believe that by passing
through the archway they can get to Heaven. Granted, it's far-fetched, but
the brothers are convinced it's the truth.

Silent Bob watches as the Miter appears slowly from behind the partition,
resembling a shark fin. It 'swims' to and fro, menacingly. Silent Bob
shakes his head.

                                 OC GLICK

And you want me to call off the ceremony... for that?

Bethany leans forward in her seat.

                                  BETHANY

Well. they're very passionate about it. Dangerously so. They could turn
violent if they walk through that arch and nothing happens.

                                   RUFUS

These guys could blow, and if they do, they're going to take some people
with them. Call this thing off.

                                   CLICK

(beat)

Who sent you? Someone from the Council of Churches, right? Somebody's upset
that we're getting so much publicity- is that it? Who was it? Rabbi Sloss?

                                   RLFLS

We were sent by Him who is called I Am.

                                   GLICK

Cute.

(standing)

Time to go. kids. Play time with the Cardinal is over.

                                   RUFUS

(to Bethany)

Worked for Moses.

                                  BETHANY

Stay out of this.

(to Glick)

Your Emminence, it's not a joke. These guys are an accident waiting to
happen. And if the re-edication ceremony goes on as planned...

                                   GLICK

...then these loonies will show up and go nuts, thus endangering the lives
of all assembled, including the Governor, the press, me, the leaders of the
Council of Churches. Heck, let's not stop there, maybe even God Himself.

                                  BETHANY

You can't say Himself; it could be a woman.

                                   GLICK

(rubs temples)

Your passion for all topics insignificant, including the gender of our
almighty lord, tests my patience, people. Now I'm a very important man with
very important matters that demand my attention, so if you'll please...

                                   RUFUS

I'm telling you man. this ceremony is a mistake.

                                   GLICK

The Catholic Church does not make mistakes.

                                   RUFUS

What about the church's silent consent to the slave trade?

                                  BETHANY

And it's platform of non-involvement during the Holocaust?

                                   CLICK

(beat)

Alright, those were mistakes. But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church responsible for oversights of old. Now
I've indulged you for more time than I should have. Please go.

                                  BETHANY

But tomorrow...

                                   CLICK

(losing it)

Tomorrow goes off without a hitch! Do I make myself clear?! I did not labor
two years and exhaust eve~ ounce of my being to insure that this ceremony
be a cornerstone in the most important liturgical event since Vatican Two
just to cancel it at the zero hour at the insistence of a wandering band of
pranksters who've targeted me as the focus of their evening's merriment!
This occasion is important for the congregation of this parish, for the
massive crowds coming for the plenary indulgence, for me, for his Holiness
the Pope, and - most importantly - for the 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign!
And neither you, nor any other influence short of the hand of God...

(glares at Bethany)

... HIM -self will prevent it from occurring successfully!

He violently grabs the Miter/shark fin 'swimming' behind the partition.

                                   GLICK

AND TAKEOFF MY GODDAMN HAT!!!

]ay slowly looks over the partition.

EXT SEASHORE

The sun slowly rises. The day has arrived.

EXT TURNPIKE - EARLY MORNING

Amidst very little traffic, two figures emerge from the shadows on the
Pennsylvania side. Bartleby and Loki step purposefully past the green sign
that welcomes motorists to New Jersey.

INT BAR - DAWN

The place is empty, except for Bethany, Rufus, Jay and Silent Bob and A
BARTENDER.

                                  BETHANY

I can almost see the headlines - if there were going to be any - "Existence
Erased - Thanks to some prick in a scarlet cape.

                                   RUFUS

It's a crime that a guy like him even gets to wear a scarlet cape.

                                    JAY

That ain't no crime. You wanna see a crime? Look what we stole from the guy
in the dress.

(to Silent Bob)

Hand it over.

Silent Bob pulls a golf club from out of his coat.

                                  BETHANY

Oh my God. We're going straight to Hell, I know it.

                                   RUFUS

You stole the Cardinal's driver?

                                    JAY

I told him to. You know how much these things are worth? That's at least a
couple of sodas and a pack of smokes right there.

                                  BETHANY

What do we do now?

                                   RUFUS

Let them keep it. In a couple of hours, it won't matter anyway.

                                  BETHANY

Not that - about Bartleby and Loki!

                                   RUFUS

We have no choice but to try to kill them.

                                  BETHANY

(to Rufus)

But you said they couldn't be killed.

                                 OC VOICE

Correction : they won't be killed.

The gang turns to see Azrael sitting at the bar.

                                  AZRAEL

And just to insure that, we're all going to sit tight, right here, until
the two idiots pass through that arch.

                                    JAY

Hey...!

                                  BETHANY

He wasn't talking about you two.

                                 OC VOICE

There's only one idiot here, .Azrael...

Bethany and Rufus react, as does the very surprised Azrael. Serendipity
stands in the doorway.

                                SERENDIPITY

And that's you.

                                  AZRAEL

The Muse. Just in time to join us for a drink.

                                 BARTENDER

(suddenly noticing Azrael)

Hey. Where'd you come from?

                                  AZRAEL

Nothingness. And that's where I'm returning to in approximately...

(checks watch)

...onehour.

                                 BARTENDER

Alright Plato - sounds like you've had enough drinks already. Let's go.

                                  AZRAEL

Come on Barkeep - just one drink for the road. Then I'm gone.

Serendipity joins Bethany and Rufus. She whispers.

                                SERENDIPITY

I was trying to find you - to tell you I'd figured out who was behind all
this.

                                   RUFUS

Is that who I think it is?

                                SERENDIPITY

None other than.

                                  BETHANY

Who is it?

                                SERENDIPITY

That's my worst suspicions confirmed.

The Bartender relents.

                                 BARTENDER

Alright - one drink. Then you're gone.

                                  AZRAEL

Gimme a Holy Bartender.

                                 BARTENDER

Never heard of it.

                                  AZRAEL

(to the group)

He doesn't know how to make a Holy Bartender.

You know - don't you, Muse?

                                SERENDIPITY

Azrael... don't.

                                  AZRAEL

(ignoring her)

Anybody? Well - I know how to make a Holy Bartender.

Azrael pulls an Uzi from his coat and blows a dozen holes in the Bartender.
The Stygian Triplets burst through the doors and everyone jumps to their
feet, with the exception of the Bartender, who dies.

                                  AZRAEL

Get it?

                                SERENDIPITY

Sweet Jesus, Azrael - why?!?

                                   RUFUS

(rushing him)

C'mon, demon - let's see you try that shit on a brother whose already dead!

The Stygian Triplets cross their sticks in front of Rufus to block him as
Azrael trains his Uzi on Bethany.

                                  AZRAEL

(joining them)

You maintain that kind of an attitude and you and the barkeep won't be the
only corpses in the room -the Christ-Bitch will join you.

                                SERENDIPITY

I can't believe you're behind this. Are you really that stupid?! Do you
know what's going to happen if those two jerks enter that church?!

                                  AZRAEL

I'm actually counting on it. And if my calculations are correct, the pawns
are moving in to check-mate as we speak.

Everyone stares at Azrael, with the exception of Jay. He suddenly laughs.

                                    JAY

I get it! Holy Bartender! That's a good one!

EXT SAINT MICHAEL'S CHURCH - MORNING

A formidable crowd of parishoners surrounds a small stage, ten yards from
the front of the church. Banners hang every~ere, heralding 'Catholicism -
Wow!' as well as the Centennial of Saint Michael's. The media eats it up.

Cardinal Glick stands at the podium, all smiles. He's in mid-speech.

                                   GLICK

I'd also like to acknowledge this great state's Governor, Elizabeth Dalton,
for coming out an helping us ring in the first hundred years of this little
parish True. she's a Protestant - but we won't hold that against her.

(crowd laughs)

Now, let me just give you a bit of history on this particular little
hundred years young House of God...

                                OC BARTLEBY

This is no longer God's House. God doesn't live here anymore.

The crowd turns, aghast. Bartleby pushes his way through them, sheepishly
followed by Loki.

                                 BARTLEBY

He's grown weary of your superficial faith and has turned a deaf ear to
your lip-service prayers. He is no longer amused, and has abandonned you -
His favorites - to the whim of judgement. Hypocrites and charlatans -
prepare to taste God's wrath!

                                   LOKI

(whispering)

Maybe we should just go.

                                 BARTLEBY

You wanted your body count, you got it. This lot is rife with sin. We'll
judge them all!

Glick grabs a COP from the crowd and pushes him toward the pair.

                                   CLICK

These are the two I was warned about, Officer McChee. Please assist them
off the church grounds.

The Cop grabs Bartleby's arm.

                                    COP

Alright mouthpiece, let's leave the nice Cardinal alone and go for a
ride...

Bartleby grabs the cops hand on his shoulder.

                                 BARTLEBY

Mister McGhee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

                                    COP

Is that so? Well, let's just...

Bartleby throws his other hand forward and twists the Cop's head around in
one brisk motion. Loki's eyes bug out. The crowd takes flight.

                                 BARTLEBY

(releasing dead Cop)

Ladies and Gentlemen - you have been judged as guilty of violations against
our Almighty Lord. And this very day - I assure you - you will all pay for
your tresspasses... in blood.

(to Loki)

Wings. Now.

                                   LOKI

I'm not so sure...

                                 BARTLEBY

DO IT!

INT BAR - LATER

Azrael still hosts his captive audience, uzi trained on the mortals. The
Stygian Triplets surround them, brandishing their sticks.

                                  BETHANY

You're a muse too?

                                SERENDIPITY

Former muse. He was kicked out.

                                  AZRAEL

Tell them, Serendipity. Tell them how I was slighted by the Almighty.

                                SERENDIPITY

You got what you deserved, you yellow shithead.

                                  AZRAEL

Ever the apple polisher. I'd hoped that when you left Paradise, you did it
finally because you couldn't tolerate the injustice that was visited upon
your own brother.

                                  BETHANY

He's your brother?!

                                SERENDIPITY

Not technically. We were created at the same time.

                                  AZRAEL

To compliment one another. Two spirits of pure inspiration.

                                 BARTLEBY

So what happened?

                                  AZRAEL

Yes. What. Lucifer got restless and started his little war for the throne.
Heaven became divided into two factions - the faithful and the renegades.
The ethereal planes were chaotic with battle, angel against angel. And when
it was all over, Cod cast the rebels into perdition.

                                SERENDIPITY

But Azrael refused to fight. He wouldn't ally himself to God or Lucifer. He
remained in the middle, waiting to see who came out victorious.

                                    JAY

What are you - some kind of fucking chicken?!

                                  AZRAEL

I was an artist! I was inspiration! A muse has no place in battle! Our job
is to create - not destroy!

                                SERENDIPITY

So after the fallen were banished to Hell, God turned on those that
wouldn't fight, and my brother here was sent down with the demons.
Something he considers a grave injustice.

                                  AZRAEL

Don't tell me that you never questioned the judgement, Serendipity; that
you don't think the Almighty acted too rashly?

                                SERENDIPITY

You've been waiting for millions of years to ask me that, haven't you? It's
been on your mind since the moment you fell. It's been gnawing at you this
long.

                                  AZRAEL

Well?

                                SERENDIPITY

No, Azrael. It never bothered me, and I'll tell you why:

you stood behind your office, you prick. So you were an artist - big deal.
Elvis was an artist, but that didn't stop him from joining the service in
time of war. That's why he's the King... and you're a schmuck.

                                  BETHANY

So all this is about revenge?! You're going to unmake existence because you
have a grudge against God?!

                                  AZRAEL

After the first million years, revenge was the farthest thing from my mind.
Self-preservation became the only necessity.

                                   RUFUS

Meaning?

                                  AZRAEL

Escape. Escape from Hell became my all-consuming reason. So I studied the
religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself; which flnallv
did. in the form of the plenary indulgence And while I couldn't exercise it
myself. I knew the perfect vessels through which I could free myself from
torment.

                                   RUFUS

Bartleby and Loki.

                                  AZRAEL

After that, it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to celebrate
their Centennial, and when that finally happened, applying some of the old
inspiration tactics - bv sending the pair an article laced with ideas. An
incantation I picked up in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heaven's
radars, and aside from the Triplets and the Gologothan, no soul in Hell had
a clue as to what was going on.

(smiles)

Won't proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the Power in a
way he never dared or dreamed.

(shakes it off)

But no plan, no matter how intricate, could succeed if the Almighty was in
the realm of the quick. So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious fashion.

                                  BETHANY

How so?

                                  AZRAEL

Oh no. I've seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal all
the details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are to
success. Suffice it to say, the Catholics have been even more helpful in
insuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav.

(gets up)

The only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion. I'm amazed that
someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the Lord's
say-so. Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that
train. But alas, here you are - powerless to stop the inevitable.

                                  BETHANY

Look, asshole - I don't know if anyone explained the rules to you, but if
you succeed, everything gets blinked out of existence - even you.

                                  AZRAEL

(beat)

Human, have you ever been to Hell? I think not. Do you know that once Hell
was nothing more than the absence of Cod? And if you'd ever been in His
presence. then you'd realize that's punishment enough. But then your kind
came along - and made it so much worse.

                                  BETHANY

Humans aren't capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like
yourself is.

                                  AZRAEL

Evil is an abstract; it's a human construct. But true to his irresponsible
nature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames his
dark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enough
for him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt -
fire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get
out of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is
beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you
commit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a
foundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. So
you bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid
imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sickness
that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there,
begging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold and
solitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhaling
the decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrors
have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg.

(beat)

Would you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look...

Azrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes. For about ten seconds, we see
some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into
240 frames of film.

Azrael pulls his hand away. Bethany is fried, convulsing uncontrolably.

                                  AZRAEL

I'd rather not exist than go back to that. And if everyone has to go down
with me, so be it.

                                SERENDIPITY

(holding up Bethany)

You're still thinking only about yourself, you fuckmg child.

                                  AZRAEL

Now, now, now. Things are getting too tense in here. What say we watch a
little t.v.

(grabs remote control)

                                    JAY

Put on channel nine - 'Davey and Goliath'!

A Stygian Triplet smacks him with it's hockey stick.

                                    JAY

Hey!

                                  AZRAEL

I was thinking more along the lines of current events.

On the T.V. - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera,
obscuring the chaos behind him. Screams are heard.

                                 REPORTER

...I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St.
Michael's... Bullets don't seem to affect them... police who were on the
scene are dead... The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees,
identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse.. I'm not a man of faith, but I'm
inclined to agree with them..

(looking OC)

NO! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!!

(pulls gun)

PLEASE!! Please...

He puts the gun in his mouth and fires. The screen goes blank.

                                  AZRAEL

(snapping off tv.)

You see that? And I told them to keep a low profile. I'd be pissed, but in
a couple of minutes, it won't matter anymore.

While he speaks, Serendipity looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob snaps to
attention, and locks eyes with Serendipity. He looks to the golf club, then
back at her. He nods.

Azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two.

                                  AZRAEL

Now what was that all about?

                                SERENDIPITY

Hunhh? Oh. nothing. I had something in my eye.

                                  AZRAEL

(getting up)

Bullshit. What are you trying to do, Serendipity -get the guy killed? Now
who's the fucking child? What did you tell him - to hit me with the golf
club? Are you serious?

(picks up golf club)

I'm a fucking demon, and you'd have him assault me with athletic equipment?

(hands club to Silent Bob)

Well, here then - take it. Call it a gift.

(stands back and hits his own chest)

Take a shot - take your best shot. C'mon - c'mon, bright boy.

The Stygian Triplets snicker. Silent Bob stares at Azrael, perplexed.

                                  AZRAEL

Don't you know anything?

Silent Bob looks to Serendipity. She nods. He shrugs and swings the club
with all his might into Azrael's chest - which caves in, blowing muck and
shit everywhere.

Rufus, Jay, and Serendipity turn on their captors, grabbing the Stygian
Triplets by the throats.

                                SERENDIPITY

BETHANY! BLESS THE SINK!

                                  BETHANY

WHAT?!?

                                SERENDIPITY

DO IT!

Bethany leaps over the bar, pushing over the dead bartender, and blesses
the melting-ice filled sink. Serendipity urges Rufus and Jay to follow her,
with the Triplets in hand. They submerge them - head first - in the sink.
Cruddy steam and muck blows out of the water. The Triplets convulse and
fall still.

Azrael clutches at his sucking chest wound, dropping to his knees. He grabs
Silent Bob's leg. Silent Bob kicks him onto his back and out cold.

                                    JAY

(joining Silent Bob)

What the fuck have you been eating?

Silent Bob shrugs.

                                  BETHANY

What just happened?

                                SERENDIPITY

(collecting hockey sticks)

He said it himself - he's a demon. You hit a demon with an instrument of
God - the pure side's always going to do the most damage.

                                    JAY

Silent Bob's an instrument of God?!

                                SERENDIPITY

No - but the driver is.

                                  BETHANY

(catching on)

And Glick's the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a better
game. And the sink...?

                                SERENDIPITY

You've got that Divine heritage going for you - sanctifing is just one of
the fringe benefits.

                                  BETHANY

Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing at my next party.

(to Jay)

How far away is this church?

                                    JAY

Three towns over - about five miles.

                                  BETHANY

We've gotta make tracks, people - there isn't much time left. Rufus, grab
his gun.

                                   RUFUS

Ten steps ahead of you.

                                  BETHANY

(going through dead bartender's pockets)

We can take the bartender's car - I don't think he'll be needing it
anymore.

Bethany and Serendipity rush out.

                                    JAY

We gonna make it?

                                   RUFUS

Was Jesus down?

Rufus and Jay exit. Silent Bob stares down at Azrael's body. Jay comes back
and yanks him out the door.

EXT STREET - DAY

Cardinal Click runs to a pay phone. Sweating and bloody, he looks a mess.
He presses '0' and looks around wildly - particularly skyward.

                                   GLICK

(to God)

Look, if you didn't like the cereal thing, we could've gone in a different
direction!

(to phone)

OPERATOR! SEND MORE POLICE TO SAINT MICHAEL'S PARISH - NOW!! PEOPLE ARE
GETTING KILLED BY...!

As he speaks, a large shadow falls over him from above. It grows larger,
enveloping Click. He drops the receiver, drops to his knees, and screams.

EXT SAINT MICHAEL'S - DAY

Bethany, Jay, Serendipity, Silent Bob, and Rufus stare OC, horrified.

                                    JAY

Holy shit.

Bodies, bodies everywhere - partial, whole, bloody - hanging, burning,
upended. No one is left standing. It's a scene straight out of Hell.
Bethany buries her face in Rufus' chest.

                                    JAY

See? And people wonder why I don't go to church.

                                  BETHANY

Are we too late?

                                SERENDIPITY

To save these poor schmucks, yes. But we still exist.

                                  BETHANY

Where are they?

                                   RUFUS

They could already be in the church.

                                SERENDIPITY

Which means that if they come out, nobody touches them.

                                    JAY

Are you shitting me? The brother here is going to shred them with his
Schwarzenneger special - ain't you, homey?

                                SERENDIPITY

If they've passed through that arch, they come out clean. And if they die,
they go straight up - and we know what happens then.

                                    JAY

What if they just kill themselves?

                                  BETHANY

They can't - it's a mortal sin. You die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They'd go to hell, and that's not what they're after.

                                    JAY

So then what the fuck are we supposed to do?! Just wait for a solution to
fall out of the sky?!

On cue, a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the
group, quite like Rufus had, way back at the start. This body, however,
bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height. Jay looks at
Rufus.

                                    JAY

Friend of your's?

                                   RUFUS

'fraid not.

                                 OC VOICE

It was a Cardinal.

They all turn to see Loki, leaning against a body or two, drinking from a
bottle of champagne. His wings lie beside him, filthy - blood spattered and
ashen. He looks exhausted. Rufus trains the gun on him.

                                   LOKI

Kind of hard to tell with his face like that, but the Rosaries are a dead
giveaway.

                                    JAY

(goes for the Uzi)

IT'S ONE OF THEM!! KILL IT!!!

                                  BETHANY

(struggling to stop him)

NO...!

She slaps the Uzi out of Jay's grip. It clatters to the side.

                                  BETHANY

(to Jay)

Don't you listen?! We can't touch them!

                                    JAY

I wasn't gonna touch him, I was gonna shoot him!

                                   LOKI

(looking skyward)

He's been at it for awhile now.

In the distance above - a mere shadow against the sky - something winged
soars and stops, releasing what looks like a very panicky human being.

                                  OC LOKI

We ran out of parishoners, so he just started picking up anyone off the
street. You're looking at eons of repression getting purged. If only we'd
been able to jerk off.

Loki drags himself a few feet backwards.

                                   LOKI

I'd step back if I were you.

They jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes. Bethany
charges at Loki, grabs his lapels, and shakes him furiously.

                                  BETHANY

WHY?!? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU HOPE TO PROVE?!? ALL THESE PEOPLE - WHY?!?

                                    JAY

(to Rufus)

I thought we weren't supposed to touch them?

                                   RUFUS

I think our Bethan's about hit her ceiling.

Loki slaps Bethany away, non-chalantly.

                                   LOKI

This wasn't my idea. alright? I just wanted to go home.

(takes a big champagne swig)

We both wanted to go home. But he snapped. When he realized who you were
and what you'd have to do, he just lost it.

(smiles)

You know what's funny about it? He never could stand to see me work. He
said he always felt son~' for you people - that you didn't know any better.

(looks up)

Now look at him.

                                    JAY

This guy's drunker than hell.

                                SERENDIPITY

Which means he's human now - his wings have been cut off.

(slapping Loki to sober him up)

Loki! Loki!

                                   LOKI

(recognizing her)

The Muse. Haven't seen you in a long time. What's with the tits?

                                SERENDIPITY

Loki - have you walked through the arch yet? C'mon. tell me! Have you gone
in and come out through the archway yet?!

                                   VOICE

No.

Bartleby lands beside them, draping his wings at his sides, brushing
himself off.

                                 BARTLEBY

We were awaiting your arrival.

                                SERENDIPITY

Bartleby - listen to me! You can't go through with this! Azrael was just
using you! If you go back this way...

Bartleby slaps her down.

                                 BARTLEBY

I've become aware of the reprocussions, Muse. I know what I'm doing.

Bethany leaps at him, all fists and fury.

                                  BETHANY

YOU FUCK! YOU SICK, TWISTED FUCK!! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! LOOK AT All
you've

done...!

Bartleby subdues her. He strokes her hair.

                                 BARTLEBY

Bethany - you of all people should understand what I'm t~'ing to accomplish
here. You too have been abandonned. You know what it's like to be cast
aside. But while you've only felt the devastating effects for a few years,
I've dealt with it for millenia. And while you never see your ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his new wife...

(picks up her face and smiles at her)

And he is...

(drops her head)

..seeing you people everywhere. everyday, trapped on this perfect little
world He created for you... it's a constant reminder that though my kind
came first, your kind was most revered. And your kind knows forgiveness,
while my kind knows regret. A lesson must be taught. All are accountable...
even God.

(steps back)

Soon a cadre of police will arrive, just in time to kill us as we exit the
church. And then this failed experiment called existence will cease to be.

Loki stumbles to his feet.

                                   LOKI

I can't... let you do this, Bartleby...

(he sways as if drunk)

I didn't know we... would end existence...

                                 BARTLEBY

(to Bethany)

My compatriot. Genocide takes a lot out of him. He's weakened. And more
importantly. he's now a human being. A condition that carries two
liabilities: a conscience...

Bartleby pulls a knife and guts Loki. He stares at Bartleby as he dies,
confused and betrayed. Serendipity nods to Rufus and Silent Bob.

                                 BARTLEBY

..and a short life span.

(in a whisper; to Loki)

Sorry, old friend - but you lost the faith.

Rufus and Serendipity and Silent Bob jump Bartleby and start throwing
punches. Silent Bob bites his wing. Jay grabs Bethany and pulls her behind
a bush.

                                  BETHANY

(peering out from behind)

He's lost it! We're fucked! We're absolutely fucked!

                                    JAY

(pulling off clothes)

I hear you.

                                  BETHANY

I can't believe this shit! We're on the brink of nonexistence and God's
still nowhere to be found! What the fuck kind of deity gets kidnapped?!

                                    JAY

(pulling open pants)

Amen to that.

                                  BETHANY

(suddenly notices him)

What the hell are you doing?!

                                    JAY

I'd say we've got about five minutes left to live; the whole world's going
to end. You said you'd fuck me.

                                  BETHANY

Are you a complete lunatic?! Everyone's out there battling that thing and
you want to cower back here and jump my bones?! We have to go down
fighting!

                                    JAY

No - no time for that foreplay stuff, just sex.

                                  BETHANY

You pig...!

                                    JAY

What?! It's all over; nobody's gonna beat that thing! Now we can either lay
here all comatose like that

John Doe Jersey bastard behind us, or we can make with the love.

Bethany freezes.

                                  BETHANY

(finally!)

What did you say?!

                                    JAY

'Make with the love'? I just said that to be sensitive. Usually I call it
boning.

                                  BETHANY

No - about John Doe Jersey?

                                    JAY

That guy - the one that they won't take off life support - John Doe Jersey.
This is where he's at.

                                  BETHANY

What? Where?

                                    JAY

Saint Michael's hospital - over there.

(points behind them)

There, across the street, sits a HOSPITAL.

                                  BETHANY

(thinks)

Where's the nearest boardwalk?

                                    JAY

Look, I ain't got time to win you a prize or something, we gotta get to it
before...

                                  BETHANY

WHERE IS IT?!?

                                    JAY

(scared)

Asbury Park. About five miles away.

                                  BETHANY

You ever been there?!

                                    JAY

(really scared)

Once. I was banging this girl who worked at the carousel. She wanted to do
it on the ride, but I got sick and started puking...

                                  BETHANY

(grabs his face)

DO THEY HAVE SKEE-BALL THERE?!?

                                    JAY

(piss-scared; high pitched)

...yes.

Bethany kisses Jay hard on the lips, jumps up and looks over the bush.

                                    JAY

(warming up)

Now that's more like it.

Rufus and Serendipity battle Bartleby, his wings thrashing about. Silent
Bob is getting back on his feet.

                                  BETHANY

BOB!

Silent Bob looks to Bethany. She waves him over and bends back down to Jay
who half-closes his eyes, and puckers his lips. Bethany pinches his lips
together and raises jay to his feet, ust as Silent Bob arri\'es.

                                  BETHANY

(to Jay)

Whatever you do - stall Bartleby from going into that church!

(to Silent Bob)

Bob - come with me!

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               FADE IN:

               CASTLE - NIGHT

               Now comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at 
               the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework 
               bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes 
               decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the 
               walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to 
               an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light 
               dances on a leaded windowpane.

               Inside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched 
               ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. 
               Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with 
               strange animal heads.

               HODGE

               A sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables 
               and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering 
               candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently.

               CONJURING ROOM

               This circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed 
               with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass 
               retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An 
               iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In 
               the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, 
               moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for 
               a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a 
               pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up 
               comes an arm and a voice blurts out:

                                     VOICE
                         Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in 
                         Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia 
                         nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt.

               Nothing happens.

                                     VOICE
                         Come on, candles, out!

               But the little flames stand at attention without so much as 
               a tremble.

                                     VOICE
                         In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi: 
                         Lux! Exstinguat!

               It's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward 
               into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face 
               of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.

               TOWER

               Carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular 
               staircase.

               TURRET

               The highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the 
               stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old 
               enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a 
               silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples 
               disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at 
               once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and 
               thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from 
               within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as 
               the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in 
               the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the 
               roar of flame and an ugly snarl.

               At that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds 
               up the candelabra.

                                     GALEN
                         Vide, Magister. There's something 
                         wrong.

               Ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the 
               basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback 
               by the old man's grim countenance.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter? What's happened?

                                     ULRICH
                         I've just seen something. Something 
                         of consequence to you.

                                     GALEN
                         To me?

                                     ULRICH
                              (calm)
                         Yes. My own death.

               With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish 
               themselves.

                                     ULRICH
                         Perhaps we had better hasten your 
                         training.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARNYARD - DAY

               Outside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and 
               ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning 
               mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward 
               the woods.

               ULRICH AND GALEN

               Hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides 
               his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the 
               forest.

                                     ULRICH
                              (stern and troubled)
                         This wood, these leaves, the birds, 
                         the very dome of heaven, once they 
                         all rang with one great chord: and 
                         philosophers like me kept it all in 
                         tune. Now, new voices are singing 
                         new songs.
                              (sharply)
                         Have you mastered the threefold 
                         transmutation?

                                     GALEN
                         Of course.

                                     ULRICH
                              (skeptical)
                         You have?

                                     GALEN
                         Well, almost.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's very difficult. Have you 
                         committed to memory undying the Codex 
                         de Profundis?

                                     GALEN
                              (a shrug)
                         The first two chapters.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's long. And what about the Ritual 
                         of Banishment as prescribed by my 
                         late master Balisarius?

                                     GALEN
                         To tell the truth, I haven't dared 
                         try it. What's the point, anyway?

                                     ULRICH
                         The point? The point is you don't 
                         know it, and you're no magician 
                         without it. It was my hope to school 
                         you, to mold your faculties and 
                         wits... I still believe you have 
                         some talent. Somewhere.

                                     GALEN
                         I hate books. I hate drill. I want a 
                         real task.

                                     ULRICH
                         There's no time now. When I'm gone, 
                         half the powers in the universe will 
                         vanish with me. And what's the use 
                         of a few lingering skills if they're 
                         left in the hands of a child?
                              (pause)
                         Listen!

                                     GALEN
                         I don't hear anything.

               Ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a 
               decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver 
               chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around 
               Galen's neck.

                                     ULRICH
                         Here, wear this.

               Galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks 
               an ear.

                                     GALEN
                         Voices, singing on the road.

               He hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. 
               Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls 
               it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the 
               ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard.

                                     GALEN
                         I don't see anything.

               He turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over 
               him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree 
               tops his master is soaring on the wind.

               AIRBORNE

               The old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and 
               far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins 
               of the forest. They are singing a mournful round.

               GALEN

               He gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and 
               addresses him.

                                     ULRICH
                              (a shout)
                         We have visitors!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROTUNDA - NIGHT

               Clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall 
               is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty 
               rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned 
               youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his 
               name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before 
               them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at 
               the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer 
               peers at himself in a full-length mirror, adjusting the hem 
               of a black robe.

                                     ULRICH
                         Looks forbidding enough, don't you 
                         think?

                                     GALEN
                         Here are your sticks.

                                     ULRICH
                         No -- they'll think me infirm. You 
                         know, Balisarius wore this whenever 
                         he changed lead into gold. He could 
                         really do that, you know. I never 
                         could. Too bad -- you'd stand to 
                         inherit some real wealth.

                                     GALEN
                         You're in a morbid frame of mind. 
                         What's all this about dying? You 
                         don't even look sick.

                                     ULRICH
                              (tying on a sash)
                         You still wearing that amulet?
                              (Galen nods)
                         Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs 
                         to me.

               He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto 
               his head.

                                     ULRICH
                         Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a 
                         handful of that sulphurous ash over 
                         there...

               The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase.

               THE ROTUNDA

               The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen 
               makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed 
               together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich.

               Galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide. 
               Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky 
               fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat.

                                     ULRICH
                         Nunc habeus lux!

               Pffst! around the room candles flare in their niches.

                                     ULRICH
                         Et calor!

               In the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich 
               totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward 
               the warmth.

                                     ULRICH
                         Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich. 
                         Which one of you calls himself 
                         Valerian?

               The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's 
               performance. The young leader of the party screws up his 
               courage and speaks.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That would be me. We are here on 
                         behalf...

                                     ULRICH
                         I know why you're here. You're a 
                         delegation from Urland, from beyond 
                         Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts.

               The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to 
               one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over 
               a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on 
               the table for Ulrich's inspection.

                                     VALERIAN
                         A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire-
                         blackened.
                              (pause)
                         Scales.

               At this, Ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering 
               irridescent disks as big as saucers.

                                     ULRICH
                         All right. How did you come by these?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (proudly)
                         I found them. At the mouth of the 
                         lair.

                                     ULRICH
                              (grim)
                         What else?

               Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears 
               to be a curved sword. He jabs it into the table.

                                     VALERIAN
                         A claw.

                                     ULRICH
                         That's no claw. It's a tooth. By the 
                         gods!

               He runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at 
               his visitors.

                                     ULRICH
                         And you want me to do battle with 
                         that?

               Valerian has lost all trace of timidity.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Who else can we turn to? We all know 
                         what we're dealing with here. This 
                         is a basilicok.
                              (he takes a step 
                              forward)
                         A cockatrice.
                              (another step, bolder)
                         A dragon.
                              (he leans close to 
                              Ulrich)
                         This is no stag, no bear, no natural 
                         creature. This is one of your kind. 
                         And only a necromancer such as 
                         yourself can rid us of it.

                                     ULRICH
                         Did you try the Meredydd sisters? 
                         What about Rinbod? I've heard it 
                         said he killed a dragon once.

                                     VALERIAN
                         They're all dead. You're the only 
                         one left.

               With a sigh, Ulrich lowers himself into a chair. He rubs his 
               withered legs and shakes his head.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's a long way to Urland.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Every quarter, upon the solstices 
                         and the equinoxes there's a new 
                         victim.

               Greil, a grizzled peasant, speaks up.

                                     GREIL
                         My daughter, for one.

                                     OTHER TRAVELERS
                         My sister... cousins...

                                     ULRICH
                         All women?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen 
                         by lot.

               Galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and 
               tooth.

                                     GALEN
                         Master, don't you think --

                                     ULRICH
                         Silence!

               He broods for a long time.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Are you afraid of dragons?

                                     ULRICH
                         No. Sorcerers and dragons go back a 
                         long long time together. If it weren't 
                         for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any 
                         dragons.
                              (pause)
                         All right. I'll go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               COURTYARD - DAY

               The travelers are making ready for departure in the grey 
               light of dawn. As Hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box, 
               Ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches.

                                     ULRICH
                         I know of this dragon. Vermithrax 
                         Pejorative: she's four hundred years 
                         old. As far as I can tell she's the 
                         last of her kind. Very appropriate 
                         that I'm the one to finish her off, 
                         don't you think?
                              (he tries out the 
                              crutches)
                         There. Flatten the highest mountain. 
                         What say you, Galen?
                              (no answer)
                         Speak up.
                              (still no answer)
                         You, Hodge.

               Hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing.

                                     ULRICH
                              (to Galen)
                         While I'm gone see you keep your 
                         nose in your books and your hands 
                         out of my reagents. Leave my 
                         instruments alone too.

               Galen crouches against the castle wall; he regards his master 
               sullenly.

                                     GALEN
                         Look at yourself. How far will you 
                         get like that? A league, two leagues?

                                     ULRICH
                         I'm not worried about the road.

                                     GALEN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Why don't you wave your hands around 
                         and summon up a coach-and-four?

                                     ULRICH
                         Don't mock me.

               Galen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders.

                                     GALEN
                         You pilgrims: You're used to 
                         lotteries. Why not draw straws to 
                         see who'll be first to carry 
                         ironshanks here.

               This is too much for Hodge.

                                     HODGE
                         Hold your tongue. If the master's 
                         got a mind to go, he'll go.

               Galen approaches the old sorcerer.

                                     GALEN
                         Send me. You're always saying I need 
                         seasoning. I need a test. Let me go.

                                     ULRICH
                         You're not ready.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm ready for anything.

                                     ULRICH
                              (wan smile)
                         Don't be so hasty. Your time will 
                         come.

               The walkers are ready to set forth. Hodge picks up his pack, 
               steps forward and pulls open the great gate.

               HORSEMEN

               Three mounted men are outside the gate, helmets on their 
               heads, swords on the belts and longbows across their 
               shoulders. They look formidable. The Urlanders take a step 
               backward.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Tyrian!?

               Tyrian is a lean, heavily bearded nobleman. There is a coat 
               of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (amiable)
                         Good morning, all.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We're not afraid of you. Give us the 
                         road.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Why, the road is yours. All the way 
                         to Urland. It's a long journey, isn't 
                         it? But when you're in search of a 
                         sorcerer, I suppose no distance is 
                         too great.

               Sensing trouble, Galen moves forward. Ulrich touches his 
               arm.

                                     ULRICH
                              (under his breath)
                         Say nothing.

               Galen hears the urgency in the old man's voice and obeys. 
               Hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers.

                                     HODGE
                         What do you want with us?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Well, like my good friends here, 
                         I've come for a bit of black magic. 
                         No doubt you've heard of our troubles 
                         at home. This is Cragganmore, is it 
                         not?

                                     HODGE
                         Aye, this be the place of Ulrich.

               Tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician.

                                     TYRIAN
                         And here we have the mystical presence 
                         himself, no?

                                     HODGE
                         You'd best keep your distance -- and 
                         your manners.

                                     TYRIAN
                         If he's ready to lay a dragon in its 
                         grave, he's got nothing to fear from 
                         me.
                              (turns to the Urlanders)
                         I've no more love for that creature 
                         than you lot. Nor has the King. But, 
                         before you stir things up, don't you 
                         think it a good idea to see you've 
                         got the right man for the job?

                                     HODGE
                         Aha -- it's a test you're looking 
                         for. We don't do tests.

                                     TYRIAN
                         I'm sure you don't. They never do 
                         tests -- and not many real deeds 
                         either. Oh, conversation with your 
                         grandmother's shade in a darkened 
                         room, the odd love potion or two... 
                         but comes a doubter, well then, it's 
                         the wrong day, the planets are not 
                         aligned, the entrails aren't 
                         favorable, we don't do tests.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We've got no doubts. We require no 
                         test.

                                     HODGE
                         And you're not going to get one.

               When Ulrich finally speaks, his voice is low and 
               authoritative.

                                     ULRICH
                              (to Galen)
                         Go to the conjuring room. The iron 
                         box. Fetch me the dagger within.

               Galen's eyes widen with alarm.

                                     ULRICH
                         The dagger. Be quick.

               Galen dashes into the castle. Ulrich gazes almost shyly at 
               Tyrian.

                                     ULRICH
                         You shall have your test.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen comes puffing up the steps, locates the iron box, and 
               flings it open. Amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a 
               professional magician is an ivory-handled dagger covered 
               with runic inscriptions. Galen eagerly examines it to see 
               how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle, 
               but it is all too genuine. A murder weapon.

                                     ULRICH'S VOICE
                              (impatient)
                         Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.

               Galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard. 
               He displays the dagger.

                                     GALEN
                         Not this one, was it?

                                     ULRICH
                         The very one. Let it fall.

               Galen hesitates, then tosses it. Tumbling end over end, it 
               arcs downward. The old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand 
               and plucks it neatly out of the air. Galen watches as Ulrich 
               passes the weapon to Tyrian and strips back his robe exposing 
               a bony chest. Galen knows what's coming. He rushes for the 
               door. He's only a step away when it bangs shut of its own 
               accord. He sprints for a second exit. Whack! This door slams 
               shut too. Locked in. Quick, back to the window and climb 
               down the vine... Smack! the heavy shutters seal him in.

               ULRICH AND TYRIAN

               Ulrich takes Tyrian's arm and guides the point of the dagger 
               to his breastbone.

                                     ULRICH
                         Vita regula, vita hieratica!

               Everyone is filled with dread. Hodge is shaking. From the 
               castle come the rattling of shutters and Galen's muffled 
               cries. A sick sarcastic smile has crept over Tyrian's lips. 
               He tenses himself to thrust.

                                     ULRICH
                         Go on. Don't worry, you can't hurt 
                         me.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the 
               shutter. Below he can see the participants in this grisly 
               drama. He holds his breath. Tyrian makes a sudden movement 
               and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest. But the sorcerer 
               stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, after a long moment, 
               he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that 
               holds it. Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in 
               a heap. Very quickly he remounts. In another moment he and 
               his companions are gone. The others are riveted in horror. 
               Hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief.

               Galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the 
               gloomy conjuring room. Click! The doors unlatch themselves 
               and swing open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FUNERAL PYRE - DAY

               Ulrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world, 
               reposes on a hardwood pyre. His hands are folded on his chest. 
               His face is peaceful. While the visitors wordlessly look on, 
               Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. At first the 
               fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to 
               envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an 
               unearthly roar. The onlookers back away from the intense 
               heat.

               GALEN

               The erstwhile apprentice stands his ground, blinking back 
               tears, his face weirdly illuminated by the fire.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CONJURING ROOM - DAY

               Galen sits alone amidst the museum-like collection of magical 
               apparatus. He stares at the amulet, considering its 
               significance. His reverie is interrupted by the murmur of 
               voices below. At the window he looks down to see Hodge bidding 
               farewell to the delegation from Urland. Valerian is the last 
               to leave. He pauses at the gate and glances up at Galen. 
               Then he moves on. The young student of magic sets his jaw, 
               suddenly filled with resolve.

               Moving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's 
               effects. He scoops up the loose books and parchments and 
               locks them into trunks. He drapes muslin cloths over the 
               alchemical devices. He sows a handful of salt over the 
               pentagram inscribed in the floor. Finally, he opens the cages 
               and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl.

               COURTYARD

               Hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping 
               ashes and small bones into a leather pouch -- the remains of 
               Ulrich. Up behind him comes Galen, now clad in a traveler's 
               cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge -- what are you doing?

               Hodge quickly conceals the pouch.

                                     HODGE
                         Just making my farewell, thank you 
                         very much.

               He quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows Galen 
               out through the gate. As the door is pushed shut a huge oaken 
               timber falls into place, barring the castle against the 
               uninvited.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HILLTOP - DAY

               Galen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn 
               to look back across a wide valley. There on another hilltop 
               on the far side sits Cragganmore, lit by the red rays of the 
               setting sun. Galen removes the amulet from his neck and 
               clutches it in his fist. Hodge is bug-eyed to see it.

                                     HODGE
                         Be careful with that! You don't know 
                         what you're doing.

                                     GALEN
                         Stand back!

               He raises his hands toward the castle and calls out:

                                     GALEN
                         Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva 
                         celet!

               CRAGGANMORE

               The vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch, 
               magically brought to animate life. They flow upward over the 
               masonry, branching out and covering every surface, then up 
               onto the roof. Finally only the tops of the chimneys and the 
               highest turrets stand above the green carpet. A century's 
               growth in a matter of seconds.

               GALEN & HODGE

               On their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a fearful 
               look. Galen is too flushed with excitement over what he has 
               done to notice.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               FOREST PATH - DAY

               Galen and Hodge trudge along an overgrown cart-track under 
               an arch of trees.

                                     HODGE
                         Oh, it's a vale of tears in which we 
                         dwell. It doesn't matter who you 
                         are, a king in his robes, a peasant 
                         in his rags, when your time comes, 
                         no magic can save you...

                                     GALEN
                         I guess...

               The apprentice's mind is elsewhere: he's got a coin hovering 
               in mid-air above his palm, bobbing gently as he walks.

                                     HODGE
                         ...the kindest lord a man could ask 
                         for... now he's gone. Ye gods he was 
                         fussy about his bath. And you'd think 
                         he could boil his own eggs with the 
                         snap of a finger, but no, he had old 
                         Hodge do it, of course.
                              (snurfling)
                         Up before five I was, mucking out 
                         the cages, slopping the pigs, and 
                         never once got so much as a thankyou 
                         or a pat on the back...
                              (through tears)
                         I'm going to miss him.

                                     GALEN
                         Me too...

               He plucks a low-hanging leaf, waves a hand over it, and 
               watches it turn into a spray of daffodils.

                                     HODGE
                         No you don't. All you care about is 
                         the tricks and knavery. Well, you 
                         don't pull any wool over these old 
                         eyes. It'll be a mighty long walk 
                         before you fill his shoes, you mark 
                         my word.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter, Hodge, pack too 
                         heavy? Here.

               He gives the pack a slap. It flies out of its harness and 
               floats alongside them. Hodge snatches it back and clutches 
               it tightly.

                                     HODGE
                         Careful with that!

                                     GALEN
                         Too cold, is it?

               A great coat drapes itself over Hodge's shoulders.

                                     HODGE
                         Stop it!

                                     GALEN
                         Too warm?

               The greatcoat disappears, as do the rest of his garments, 
               leaving him in his smalls.

                                     HODGE
                              (spluttering)
                         Stop it, I say! Out of respect for 
                         the master!

               Suppressing a grin, Galen mercifully waves his hand and 
               restores Hodge to his usual costume.

                                     GALEN
                         I've got as much respect for the 
                         master as anyone, old man. But -- 
                         then again, I'm master now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TRAVELERS' CAMP - NIGHT

               The Urlanders are gathered around a fire, sharing a meager 
               supper. The man named Greil pokes at the stew-pot.

                                     GREIL
                         I left my farm with seeds unplanted, 
                         calves unborn, nothing but a wife to 
                         chase down the strays, and for what? 
                         A funeral, that's what.

               He walks up and down behind Valerian.

                                     GREIL
                         Because some people said, find a 
                         magician. Not just a local fellow, 
                         an import, a good forty leagues from 
                         home. An all-powerful necromancer. 
                         Ha -- some necromancer!

               Malkin, an older man, speaks up.

                                     MALKIN
                         Hold your tongue, Greil. Sit. Eat.

                                     GREIL
                         I'll not sit. I'll not eat. See you 
                         the Great Bear. His tail points east. 
                         It's the equinox. Have you forgotten? 
                         Or rather not think about it?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (miserable)
                         He's right. I brought us here for 
                         nothing. May the gods help whoever's 
                         daughter it is tonight.

               There is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire. Two 
               of the men get to their feet and listen. At first silence, 
               then more rustling. Without a word the two men dart into the 
               bushes and haul two interlopers before the company: Galen 
               and Hodge.

                                     HODGE
                         Good morrow, good morrow. Peace be 
                         with you.

                                     GALEN
                         Easy now. We mean no harm. We've 
                         been looking for you.

                                     GREIL
                              (growl)
                         Well, you've found us.

                                     GALEN
                              (brushing himself off)
                         More the other way around, I'd say.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What do you want?

                                     GALEN
                         A few words, that's all. You were 
                         looking for a conjurer.

                                     VALERIAN
                         He's dead.

                                     GALEN
                         Right. Requiscat in pace.
                              (he takes a deep breath)
                         Ecce: magister novus!

                                     GREIL
                         How say you?

               Galen surveys the puzzled faces. He draws himself up and 
               plunges in:

                                     GALEN
                         My lord Ulrich is no longer. All 
                         that you asked of him, you may now 
                         expect of me. The dangers he would 
                         face, I will now conquer. The task 
                         he would undertake I will now fulfill. 
                         I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of 
                         Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I 
                         am the Sorcerer you seek.

               There is a moment of depressed silence. Hodge rolls his eyes. 
               Greil starts to chuckle, then to laugh. Soon the others are 
               laughing too.

                                     GREIL
                         Well, that's a handsome thought, O 
                         wizard of wizards. But if there's 
                         one thing our friend Tyrian has shown 
                         us, it's to beware the pig in the 
                         poke. Who's got a dagger?

                                     HODGE
                         No tests!!

                                     GREIL
                         Call it proof, then.

               Someone brings out a dagger and hands it to Greil. Valerian 
               pushes it away.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We've seen enough tests.

               But Greil persists, waving the knife at the group.

                                     GREIL
                         Well I haven't. All I've seen is 
                         death. Death in our families, death 
                         on the road, and tonight, death at 
                         home.

               He lashes out with the knife. Galen jumps back, but Valerian 
               steps in, delivering a quick kick to Greil's gut, followed 
               by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man sprawling. 
               He takes the knife.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's come over you, anyway? Have 
                         you lost your wits?

               He propels Galen out of harm's way and sits him down on the 
               other side of the fire. Greil nurses his jaw.

                                     GREIL
                         I don't like it. Young snot-nose 
                         comes in here for sport at our 
                         expense. We're on a fool's errand, 
                         but we don't have to listen to this. 
                         I don't want to hear any more about 
                         sorcery. I don't want to hear any 
                         more about spells.

               Valerian hands Galen a plate of food.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You must be hungry.

                                     GALEN
                              (nods)
                         What's the matter with him?

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's not just him. It's all of us. 
                         It's the equinox.

               They both look up at the moon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT

               The moon shines down on the far reaches of the Kingdom of 
               Urland, coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the 
               skeletons of dead trees, blackened rock and bare ground. 
               Advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed 
               men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril. The horse is 
               skittish. Finally, in spite of shouts and lashings, it refuses 
               to go further. The leader, Horsrik, barks out an order:

                                     HORSRIK
                         Close enough! Bring her out!

               A young woman, no more than seventeen, is brought forth from 
               the cart. Long black hair falls down over a white tunic. Her 
               dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face. She is 
               half-carried, half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack 
               in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post. By 
               lantern-light, Horsrik reads from a parchment scroll.

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom, that this maiden, having 
                         lawfully been chosen by a deed of 
                         fortune and destiny, shall hereby 
                         give up her life for the greater 
                         good of Urland.

               There is a low rumble; the earth shakes. Horsrik glances 
               nervously around. He carries on by rote.

                                     HORSRIK
                         By this act shall be satisfied the 
                         powers that dwell underground and 
                         the spirits that attend thereto. In 
                         gratitude for this sacrifice His 
                         Majesty has declared the family -- 
                         what's the name? --

               He prods the girl, but she is too terrified to speak. Beneath 
               them, the earth seems to groan. Smoke issues from the mouth 
               of the pit. One of the nervous witnesses leans forward.

                                     RETAINER
                         Plowman! The family Plowman!

                                     HORSRIK
                              (rushing it)
                         -- the family Plowman to be free of 
                         obligations, taxations, levys and 
                         imposts for a period not to exceed 
                         five years...

               The horse suddenly rears, and blindfold notwithstanding, 
               gallops off, dragging the tumbril over the rocks. The men 
               behind Horsrik break ranks and scatter.

                                     HORSRIK
                         -- ordained and signed this day, 
                         etc., Casiodorus, in his glory the 
                         reigning king of this our realm... 
                         his seal, his mark, duly read by 
                         Chancellor Horsrik in his holy name.

               Now Horsrik joins the flight, chasing his men back over the 
               murky horizon.

               THE GIRL

               She strains against her manacles, cocking her head to listen 
               as the rumblings below subside. Presently the steam and smoke 
               blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a 
               hundred yards distant, the wheel of the cart jammed between 
               rocks. Summoning up a wild will to live, she squeezes her 
               hands against the cold iron rings. No use. She spits on her 
               wrists and twists desperately. Blood starts. One hand slips 
               free. She looks at the horse. The animal tosses off its 
               blindfold and looks back at her. Now she strains again and 
               pulls her other hand free. She wipes the blood on her frock 
               and sprints toward the horse. But she doesn't get there. The 
               earth abruptly shifts from under her feet, tumbling her among 
               cracked and steaming rocks. When she raises her head a huge 
               shadow has fallen over the horse. There is a piteous whinny, 
               then a roar. The girl's face is suddenly lit by flames. She 
               scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way.

               THE CHASE

               The girl hasn't taken a dozen steps when something huge 
               hurtles forward and blocks her way. Something scaly and 
               glittering. She whirls and stumbles off in a new direction. 
               This time she's cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier-
               like talons. She screams and crawls away. Another claw 
               prevents her escape.

               THE CREATURE

               Membranous wings fold down against the night sky. Up comes 
               the silhouette of a reptilian head swaying on a serpentine 
               neck. There's an angry hiss. A sheet of flame envelops 
               everything.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               FOREST - DAY

               Tyrian kneels beside a mountain waterfall, having a drink 
               while his men hover in the background. One of them points 
               down the slope.

                                     MAN
                         There. I see them.

               Tyrian wipes his mouth unhurriedly and strolls over to look. 
               Far below, half hidden by trees, the little company of 
               Urlanders winds its way through the forest.

               A frown creeps over Tyrian's face.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Who's that old man?

                                     MAN
                         Where? Which one?

                                     TYRIAN
                         That one. That's the man from 
                         Cragganmore. Now what's he doing 
                         here?

                                     MAN
                         Filling in for the chief, I reckon.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (weary)
                         What a pity.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HODGE

               Hodge marches along with the rest. When he's sure no one 
               else is looking he burrows into his garments and brings out 
               the leather pouch containing Ulrich's ashes. Reassured that 
               it's still with him, he tucks it away again. Galen falls 
               into step.

                                     GALEN
                         What have you got there?

                                     HODGE
                         None of your business.

                                     GALEN
                         A little gold, eh? What do you say I 
                         change it into lead?

                                     HODGE
                         Save your jokes for someone else. 
                         Me, I don't care for braggarts.

               They pass Valerian, who has dropped out of line.

                                     HODGE
                         And I don't care for frauds.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm no fraud.

                                     HODGE
                         Call it fool then. Upstart. Whatever 
                         pleases you.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge, nobody forced you to come 
                         along.

                                     HODGE
                         Oh, I'm here of my own free will, 
                         all right. We each do the master's 
                         bidding in our own way.

                                     GALEN
                         Well, if he told you I needed 
                         wetnursing, why don't you just turn 
                         yourself around and go back home.

               Hodge snorts and fusses with his pack.

                                     HODGE
                         Home, is it? You've seen to that, 
                         haven't you? Gone to seed, I'd say...

               He glances over and discovers Galen missing.

               GALEN

               He walks back along the trail, looking for Valerian. Pretty 
               soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight. He hears 
               the sound of a splash. He turns off the trail and pushes 
               through some shrubbery.

               FOREST POOL

               Under the oaks and hickory, a forest stream has widened into 
               a quiet pool. A pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge. 
               Out in the middle, Valerian is treading water.

                                     GALEN
                         You're too far behind us. Come on 
                         out.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You go ahead, I'll catch up.

                                     GALEN
                         Not a good idea to get separated. 
                         Let's go.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Right. I'll be along.

               Galen leans over and splashes some water on his face. Feels 
               good. He shucks his pack and starts to throw off his clothes. 
               Valerian doesn't like it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's all right. Don't come in.

               But Galen is now naked and walking into the water. He swims 
               out toward Valerian.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (edgy)
                         You better get back to the group, 
                         they're probably worried.

               Galen keeps swimming.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I prefer to swim alone, if you don't 
                         mind.

               But Galen has slipped beneath the surface; he doesn't hear.

               UNDERWATER

               Galen works his way through the murky green underwater world. 
               Suddenly, he stops short and stares. He's only a few feet 
               from Valerian's dangling legs. He gasps in surprise. Valerian 
               is no boy.

               ON THE SURFACE

               Galen comes shooting to the surface, coughing and sputtering.

                                     GALEN
                         By the gods!

               Valerian is pale and frightened.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Stay away.

               She propels herself backward, then turns and swims for shore.

               ON THE SHORE

               Galen and Valerian have taken refuge behind separate bushes. 
               Briskly they pull on their clothes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I suppose you'll tell everyone. Go 
                         ahead, I don't care. It's a relief.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm not going to say anything.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't blame you. I was stupid. 
                         Careless. A silly woman!

                                     GALEN
                              (feeble bluff)
                         Take it easy. I knew the moment I 
                         saw you. I've known the whole time.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You never knew a thing. No one knew. 
                         Not since I was born. Go on, run off 
                         and tell them. It'll make a great 
                         story.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't worry. No one's going to find 
                         out. Just tell me: why?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Ask my father.

               They finish dressing in silence. Finally:

                                     GALEN
                         The lottery! Daughters are chosen, 
                         but sons are not!

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's right. Unless you have plenty 
                         of gold or property.

                                     GALEN
                         What do you mean?

                                     VALERIAN
                         If you're rich enough, your name 
                         never goes in.
                              (bitter)
                         My father is poor. So are a lot of 
                         fathers.

               He studies her. She jams a hat down over her head and, once 
               more the young man, stalks off.

               THE VISION

               Galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his 
               pack. As he leans over he catches sight of what appears to 
               be a reflection in the water: Tyrian on horseback. He whips 
               around, but no one is behind him. Riveted by the vision, he 
               hurries along the bank to follow it. After a few paces the 
               blurry figure dismounts, unslings a longbow, nocks an arrow 
               and draws the string taut.

                                     GALEN
                              (horrified)
                         No!

               FOREST

               Galen sprints through the trees. Up ahead is Valerian, walking 
               resolutely.

                                     GALEN
                         No!

               She glances back at him and grimly keeps on walking. Galen 
               shoots past her and on into the forest.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge!

               TRAVELERS

               Galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the Urlanders 
               coming toward him. Hodge precedes the group with an unsteady 
               gait. He sees Galen, raises up his arms and flops face down 
               on the trail. A long arrow protrudes from his back. Galen 
               kneels beside him. The uneasy company keeps its distance. 
               Hodge struggles to speak.

                                     HODGE
                         Galen? Can you hear me?

                                     GALEN
                         I hear you.

                                     HODGE
                         You know, somebody shot me, but I 
                         can still talk. There's something 
                         that has to be done.

                                     GALEN
                         I know.

                                     HODGE
                         Not that cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes. 
                         Here.

               Hodge's hand comes out from under his coat gripping the 
               leather pouch. Galen tugs at it, but Hodge can't let go.

                                     HODGE
                         Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel 
                         it loose.

               Galen pries the sack out of Hodge's clenched fingers. Suddenly 
               the hand comes up, grabs Galen by the hair, and pulls him 
               near.

                                     HODGE
                              (a croak)
                         ...burning water... find the lake, 
                         throw it in...

                                     GALEN
                              (holding up the pouch)
                         What are you doing with this, Hodge?

                                     HODGE
                         ...burning water...

               He dies. Galen frees himself from his grasp.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're 
                         not going to die.

               Galen is frantic. He pulls out the amulet and wraps his hand 
               around it.

                                     GALEN
                         Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!
                              (he shakes the body)
                         Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!

               But Hodge has passed on, and Galen's magic has no way to 
               reach him. Suddenly the youth cries out in pain. He drops 
               the amulet and looks at his palm. The device has burned his 
               flesh. Now he becomes aware of troubled Urlanders looking 
               over his shoulder, witness to his failure.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LAKE - DAY

               Wind whips the leaden wave tops on a vast rainy lake. The 
               travelers are rowing across in an open longboat, aided by a 
               tattered lateen sail. Valerian mans the steering oar at the 
               stern while Galen broods in the bow. He feels like an imposter 
               in their eyes.

               FJORD

               The boat pulls into a long narrow waterway with granite cliffs 
               on either side. Moving through swirls of fog, they beach the 
               boat and step out onto a craggy shore. Greil leans over and 
               kisses a rock.

                                     GREIL
                         Urland!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               The travelers descend a mountain pass and emerge through a 
               wrack of cloud into a gray and cheerless region. Fire-
               blackened trees dot the barren landscape. As they reach the 
               flatlands, the Urlanders instinctively pick up the pace. 
               Galen slows to inspect the weird surroundings. Valerian trots 
               past him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Come on. Don't dawdle here.

               Galen falls into step with her.

                                     GALEN
                         The whole kingdom like this?

                                     VALERIAN
                         No. We're near the lair. Keep moving.

               Galen looks around with new interest.

                                     GALEN
                         Where?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Over there. Doesn't matter. We're in 
                         no danger if we just pass through 
                         quickly.

               Galen stops. High on the slope beside them is a gaping 
               fissure.

                                     GALEN
                         I see it. Let's have a look.

                                     VALERIAN
                         No!

               But Galen is already toiling up the incline.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Greil! Malkin! Help!

               The travelers turn to see what's the matter.

               THE LAIR

               Galen approaches the lair, pausing beside a wooden post with 
               iron manacles dangling from it. He fingers them thoughtfully. 
               Malkin, Greil and Valerian rush up behind him, their faces 
               drawn with worry.

                                     GREIL
                         Look, you don't have to do this. We 
                         know you're a fine young magician. 
                         None better. There's no need to prove 
                         it to us.

                                     GALEN
                         Are there other entrances?

                                     VALERIAN
                         No. One's enough.

                                     GREIL
                         Come on. The road's this way. We'll 
                         tell everybody how close you got.

                                     GALEN
                              (coolly)
                         No smoke. How do you know it's in 
                         there?

                                     GREIL
                         Don't be a fool. Come away now and 
                         live to tell about it.

               Instead, Galen starts into the crack. Greil and Malkin hasten 
               away, but Valerian lingers, watching in mounting frustration 
               as Galen probes further and further into the lair. She picks 
               up a fistful of stones and throws them at him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Go ahead! You're going to die! What 
                         a fine trick that will be!

               But Galen is lost in the gloom. She flees.

               UNDERGROUND

               Galen puts his hand on the rugged wall: the rocks are hot to 
               the touch. Something glinting on the floor catches Galen's 
               eye: an irridescent disk, a dragon scale. It flashes the 
               colors of the rainbow as Galen examines it. All at once the 
               ground shudders; chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. A 
               pall of smoke billows up from the depths.

               OUTSIDE

               Galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a 
               swirl of smoke. There is no sign of the Urlanders. He throws 
               down his pack, climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the 
               massive cliffs rising behind the lair. He grasps the amulet 
               and closes his eyes.

                                     GALEN
                         Now, great mountain, hear my command: 
                         Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum 
                         draconis! Evanescat latibulum 
                         draconis!

               LANDSLIDE

               With a thunderous splitting sound, the entire top of the 
               cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the 
               mountain, sweeping tons of debris into the air. Boulders the 
               size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician. 
               Eyes wide with awe, he turns and runs for his life. Even as 
               he careens down the slope, chunks of rock rumble past. One 
               catches him at the knee and sends him flying.

               He covers his head and joins the landslide. Finally the dust 
               lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the 
               cowering Urlanders. They look with real fear at the man who 
               just conjured up the Apocalypse. Tattered and torn, covered 
               with dirt, Galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at 
               his handiwork.

               LANDSCAPE

               The territory has been drastically transformed: the dragon's 
               lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite. 
               The Urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction. 
               Galen grins a triumphant split-lip grin that fails to win 
               them over. Presently they back away and run off down the 
               trail, Valerian in their midst. Galen's grin fades.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - DAY

               The Village of Swanscombe is little more than a rough and 
               ready collection of thatched huts and mud-daubed outbuildings 
               surrounded by cultivated fields. Dogs sleep in open door-
               ways; chickens peck around the communal well -- but there 
               are no people in evidence as Valerian and her company troop 
               into town.

               VALERIAN

               She trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith 
               shop.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father? Hello?

               She goes over to the forge. Hot coals are burning. She becomes 
               aware of a sound -- voices -- chanting.

               SQUARE

               She walks across the square toward the voices. She is joined 
               by Greil, Malkin and the other travelers, all of them puzzled 
               by the desolation. As they approach the grange hall the voices 
               grow louder. They seem to be singing. The main doors open 
               briefly and three villagers scamper out, dripping wet and 
               wrapped in white muslin. Valerian and her companions look at 
               each other in astonishment.

               IN THE GRANGE HALL

               In a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is 
               being held under water. After a few moments she is pulled to 
               the surface by a tall red-haired man with long bony fingers: 
               Brother Jacopus Januensis, a Carthusian monk. There's a wooden 
               cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye. Gathered around 
               him are the missing villagers, every man woman and child, 
               here to be baptised and sing a few newly-learned hymns in 
               praise of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Now are you cleansed of your sins! 
                         Now are you born again, purified in 
                         spirit, into the fellowship of Jesus 
                         Christ!

               The travelers enter and mingle with the congregation. Valerian 
               scans the crowd until she locates her father, Simon, a balding 
               sturdy journeyman. He's overjoyed at her return and gives 
               her a hearty embrace.

                                     SIMON
                         Welcome back, my son.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father, what are you doing? Have you 
                         all lost your minds?

                                     SIMON
                         Some have.

               He points to the monk, who is dunking a screaming infant and 
               carrying on about the Bishop of Rome.

                                     SIMON
                         It's this monk. He can read and write, 
                         and talk too, I'm afraid.

                                     VALERIAN
                         And they listen?

                                     SIMON
                         Shh! They think this a holy place, a 
                         tabernacle.

                                     VALERIAN
                         This is the granary. What kind of 
                         welcome is this? I've got news of 
                         the sorcerer and news of the dragon.

                                     SIMON
                         You were brave to go, you and your 
                         friends. But nobody cares. Listen -- 
                         he knows what they want to hear.

               MONK

               Brother Jacopus strides back and forth before the assembly 
               in an inspired state.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         The man who walks with Christ is not 
                         a man to fear a dragon: Yea, though 
                         I walk through the valley of the 
                         shadow of death I will fear no evil! 
                         You say you are preyed upon by a 
                         foul beast. Yes, but what is the 
                         nature of this beast? It comes to 
                         you on bat's wings and clawed feet, 
                         does it not? It breathes fire, does 
                         it not? And it lives under ground. 
                         This is no dragon. This is Lucifer!

                                     VOICE
                         Whoever it is, he's dead.

               This is Galen, who has just stepped into the hall, tattered, 
               bedraggled and triumphant.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Nay, brother! It is not as easy as 
                         that. Allegiance to Christ, to be 
                         sure, but also prayer and confession. 
                         These are the arms by which Satan 
                         may be put down.

                                     GALEN
                         You're talking about superstition, 
                         friend. None of that has anything to 
                         do with what I, Galen, have already 
                         achieved.

               He marches to the center of the gathering.

                                     SIMON
                              (to Valerian)
                         You brought this stranger?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Ulrich's apprentice. He's a braggart, 
                         but it doesn't matter.

                                     GALEN
                         People of Urland! Send a messenger 
                         to the king. Vermithrax is dead. 
                         Crushed by the power of the moon and 
                         the stars! Laid low by ancient wisdom. 
                         Dropped into the Abyss by mystical 
                         practice.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Spoken like a pagan. Every word as 
                         reprobate as it is false!
                              (holding up his cross)
                         Solum in hoc signo vinces!

                                     GALEN
                         Nihil plus mysterium!

               He gestures boldly and a fireball crackles at the monk's 
               feet. The holy man scurries back. A hush falls upon the 
               congregation.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               A procession of curious villagers winds its way into the 
               badlands. They gather on a promontory overlooking the dragon's 
               lair. They stand there for a long time, a chill wind whipping 
               their garments, trying to understand what's happened. The 
               monk is mightily displeased.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Praise God! Blessed is he that is 
                         humble before the Lord!

                                     VALERIAN
                         Your god had nothing to do with it.

               Indeed, Galen's act is already the stuff of legend:

                                     MALKIN
                         We saw it with our own eyes. He flew 
                         to the mountain top. He was a bird. 
                         He brought forth lightning. I saw 
                         it.

               Some of the younger villagers scamper forward to the spot 
               where the cave had its opening. With yells and whoops they 
               beat the ground with clubs. In the crowd Simon begins to 
               smile, then to laugh. Soon he leads the villagers in a 
               tumultuous cheer. Brother Jacopus and some of his converts 
               drop to their knees and pray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CELEBRATION

               The inhabitants of Swanscombe have decked out the town square 
               and are making a night of it. By torchlight they dance merrily 
               to jigs and reels provided by the local fiddlers. Ale flows 
               freely from oak casks.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               Valerian is kneeling before a trunk full of women's clothing. 
               She pulls out a long simple frock, goes to a crude mirror, 
               and holds it up against her body to gauge the effect. Her 
               father comes up behind her. He is angry and frightened.

                                     SIMON
                         Put that away. What if you were seen?

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm going to be seen. I want to be 
                         seen. Tonight the world finds out 
                         that you never had a son.

                                     SIMON
                         No, you mustn't do that. It's too 
                         soon. We've got to think about this, 
                         we've got to make a plan.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father: the danger is over.

               He sits on the bed and puts his head in his hands.

                                     SIMON
                         I know. What am I going to say to my 
                         friends who still mourn for their 
                         lost girls.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You'll say you did what you had to. 
                         This is a time for celebration -- 
                         and forgiveness.

               He looks up at her, trying to imagine what it's going to be 
               like having a daughter.

               CELEBRATION

               Galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed kids and not a 
               few adults, entertaining them by pulling duck's eggs out of 
               their ears and causing coins to disappear. Presently he feels 
               the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing 
               behind him. He turns to find a shy but determined Valerian 
               sweetly decked out in her blue frock. A buzz goes through 
               the crowd. Valerian blushes and wavers: she seems ready to 
               bolt for home. But Galen takes her by the hand, and with 
               conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance.

               DANCE

               It's forward, back and around sixth-century style: the young 
               sorcerer can't take his eyes off his partner. But she's too 
               shy to return his gaze.

                                     GALEN
                         Looks like you've been up to a little 
                         sorcery yourself.

               Valerian doesn't know what to say.

                                     GALEN
                         Or is it witchcraft?

               She still doesn't reply. It's all she can do to keep on 
               dancing.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter? A real woman never 
                         stops talking.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I think it was much easier being a 
                         boy.

               SIMON & GREIL

               They stand on the sidelines, watching the young couple step 
               to the music.

                                     SIMON
                         The damnedest thing is, she was twice 
                         the man of anyone else in the village. 
                         Now she's twice the woman.

                                     GREIL
                              (grim)
                         Would that I had been as clever as 
                         her father.

                                     SIMON
                         Come now, Greil. Don't begrudge a 
                         life spared.

                                     GREIL
                         I begrudge nothing. But I wonder at 
                         what we have seen and how it was 
                         done.

                                     SIMON
                         You were there.

                                     GREIL
                         I saw what I saw. But this jack-anapes 
                         was barely ready to carry his master's 
                         chamberpot. Isn't it strange that at 
                         the very moment the beast is put 
                         down we should have a holy man here 
                         in the village?

                                     SIMON
                         You don't believe that superstitious 
                         Christian rot, do you?

                                     GREIL
                              (defensive)
                         It is said God works his wonders in 
                         mysterious ways.

               CELEBRATION

               While the proud Simon dances in the background with his 
               daughter, a group of tipsy villagers clusters around Galen, 
               belching forth a drinking song. The young magician raises 
               his own mug and joins in on the chorus. Abruptly the music 
               stops. The singing dies away. The ensuing silence is broken 
               by the sound of galloping hooves. Presently three horsemen 
               appear at the end of town: Tyrian and his henchmen. They 
               guide their horses forward into the midst of the merry-makers. 
               Tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way.

                                     TYRIAN
                         A celebration! Don't stop on my 
                         account. You -- musicians, more music!

               The musicians leave their instruments in their laps. Tyrian 
               draws himself a measure of ale and raises it above his head.

                                     TYRIAN
                         A toast! To the deed of the day! You 
                         see, good news travels fast. The 
                         King himself has already heard it. 
                         And like yourselves, tonight he's 
                         overcome with joy.

                                     MALKIN
                         What would you have of us then?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Not a thing. It's this one.
                              (he gestures toward 
                              Galen)
                         The King would meet our new benefactor 
                         and offer his gratitude to the man 
                         who succeeded where so many have 
                         failed.

                                     GALEN
                              (sobering up)
                         What sort of gratitude? A knife in 
                         the belly? An arrow in the back?

               Tyrian's smile freezes on his face. He steps in front of 
               Galen, towering over him.

                                     TYRIAN
                         My young friend, I'd as soon dispatch 
                         you as I did the others, and for the 
                         same reason. But his Majesty would 
                         like a cozy chat, and commands 
                         otherwise.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Don't go, Galen. Cast a spell and 
                         turn them into toads. It should be 
                         easy; that's what they are.

               Tyrian regards her coolly, taking in her change of costume 
               and its meaning.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Well, well: still plenty of cheek 
                         under those skirts, it seems.

               Having buried the dragon under a mountain, Galen decides 
               he's not worried about an appearance at court. He smiles at 
               Valerian.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't worry. I'll be back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               RIDERS

               Three horses gallop through the moors and fens of central 
               Urland. Galen is tucked up behind Tyrian. On the distant 
               horizon, the battlements of the King's castle glow in the 
               slanting light of a new day.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THRONE ROOM - DAY

               Within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight 
               poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls. In 
               the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne. There is 
               Casiodorus Rex, King of Urland, a bearded man in his fifties, 
               as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. He is 
               flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and Tyrian. 
               Standing before them all is Galen, looking unhappy. He pours 
               a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet.

                                     GALEN
                         One of the best things about the 
                         water here in Urland is that there's 
                         so much of it -- look at that!

               Water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing. 
               Galen takes a sip.

                                     GALEN
                         Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. 
                         Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from 
                         his Majesty.

               The King makes no sign. Galen approaches stiffly, takes a 
               scarf and retreats.

                                     GALEN
                         I cover the goblet, so... remove, 
                         so... and behold: winter in a mug!

               And he's done it: he turns the goblet over and a small chunk 
               of ice hits the floor. The royal reaction is equally frosty. 
               Galen is bombing, and he knows it.

                                     GALEN
                         All right. How many of you have ever 
                         seen a table fly?

               He mutters an incantation. In the audience, Tyrian notes 
               that Galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet. There is 
               a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins 
               to jitter and buck. As the wine spills and plates go flying, 
               the King wearily raises a hand.

                                     KING
                         Enough! That's fine.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait, it'll rise now.

                                     KING
                         Don't bother. Not necessary.

               The table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and 
               crockery at the onlookers' feet.

                                     KING
                         Tell me: the landslide -- it was 
                         accomplished this same way?

                                     GALEN
                         Yes.

                                     KING
                         I see. And having rendered such unique 
                         service to our kingdom, what would 
                         you claim as a reward?

                                     GALEN
                         Please -- no payment. I have always 
                         found magical practice to be its own 
                         reward. I seek only some yet greater 
                         challenge.

               This handsome sentiment doesn't go over any better than his 
               tricks.

                                     KING
                         Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric? 
                         Of course not, you weren't even born. 
                         He was my brother, a great King and 
                         a valiant man-at-arms. When he 
                         ascended to the throne, the dragon 
                         was unbridled. No one knew where it 
                         might strike next. So he brought 
                         forth his broadsword and his spear, 
                         assembled a company of his best 
                         fighters and went out to do battle.
                              (pause)
                         He was never seen again. But his 
                         attack provoked the most terrible 
                         reprisals: whole villages incinerated, 
                         entire crops burned. Death, famine, 
                         horrible.

               The King grimaces as the memories come flooding back.

                                     KING
                              (quietly)
                         How did you arrogate to yourself the 
                         role of savior?

                                     GALEN
                         I was invited.

                                     KING
                         Not by me. Did you ever consider the 
                         consequences of failure?

                                     GALEN
                         What failure? What's the matter with 
                         you people? You want the dragon back?

                                     KING
                         Then the beast is dead?

                                     GALEN
                         Yes, of course. Dead.

                                     KING
                         We shall see.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DUNGEON

               Two guards thrust Galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred 
               door shut. The young sorcerer waits until they're safely out 
               of sight, then takes out his amulet. He ponders it for a 
               doubtful moment. Suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips 
               it off his neck and out through the bars.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Thank you.

               He makes an ironic salute and leaves. Galen sits down heavily 
               and stares at the stone walls.

               CORRIDOR

               Unseen by Galen, a figure clad in silk and lace skitters 
               down a murky dungeon hallway and peers around a corner. 
               Stealing a look at Galen is the Princess Elspeth, a fey beauty 
               in her early twenties. After a moment, spooked by some 
               imagined noise, she flits away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Dark clouds slide across a pale sun, throwing the ruined 
               land below into shadow. Soon fat droplets of rain are 
               splattering on the rocks above the dragon's lair. With each 
               tiny splash there is a sizzle and a puff of steam. These 
               rocks are hot!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DUNGEON

               Outside the barred window, a steady rain is falling. Inside, 
               Galen uses a chunk of limestone to inscribe a pentagram on 
               the floor of his cell. He marks runic signs on the window 
               sill and lintel. Then, positioning himself in the center of 
               the mystic symbol, he raises his hands and spreads his 
               fingers.

                                     GALEN
                              (authoritative)
                         Cubiculum gravis aperat!

               There's a long moment when nothing happens. A very long 
               moment. Finally, a thoroughly frustrated Galen leaps to the 
               window and rattles the bars.

                                     GALEN
                         Open up, dammit! Fenestra gravis 
                         aperat! Asser gravis aperat! 
                         Divinitus!

                                     VOICE
                         Salve, magistrum iuvenilum.

               Startled, Galen whirls around to find Elspeth standing outside 
               his cell. She hands some food and blankets through the bars.

                                     ELSPETH
                         I've studied Latin. Greek, too. Me 
                         appelo Elspeth, filia regis.

               Galen looks her over. He's never seen anyone so angelic.

                                     GALEN
                         How do you do.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Please don't think ill of us. My 
                         father is a wonderful man, a wise 
                         man. The lottery was his idea.

                                     GALEN
                         I see.

                                     ELSPETH
                         You don't understand. From the moment 
                         it began, the dragon was tame. The 
                         kingdom prospered.

                                     GALEN
                         And only a few had to be sacrificed.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Yes, that's true. Isn't it better 
                         that a few should die that many might 
                         live?

                                     GALEN
                         Depends on who does the dying.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Oh, but we all take our chances. My 
                         father is a just man. My name is 
                         entered on the lists, along with 
                         every other young --

                                     GALEN
                         Virgin?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Maiden.

                                     GALEN
                         If you say so.

                                     ELSPETH
                         What do you mean?

                                     GALEN
                              (sighs)
                         Nothing.

                                     ELSPETH
                         I've participated in every drawing 
                         since I came of age.

                                     GALEN
                         Maybe.

                                     ELSPETH
                         It's true. You don't believe me. You 
                         think I'm lying. Well I'm not.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families 
                         with money, that sort of thing.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Don't listen to rumors. They're lies. 
                         I have to go now.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait -- how long do I have to stay 
                         in here?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Until we know. Not long. Goodbye. 
                         Vale. Dormi bene.

               She slips away down the corridor.

               LIBRARY

               King Casiodorus and Tyrian are huddled over a table piled 
               high with manuscripts and papers. Tyrian clears a spot and 
               sets out a stack of lead bars.

                                     KING
                         That's enough. Let's not be greedy 
                         here.

               The King picks up Galen's amulet, and holds it over the bars 
               in his clenched fist.

                                     KING
                         Now then: I, Casiodorus Rex do hereby 
                         command thou base metal to change 
                         thy essence and become gold.

               There is a rustle of skirts and Elspeth appears behind him.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Father?

                                     KING
                         Not now. Tyrian, remove all but one 
                         bar. We'll try it one at a time.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Father: did you know that some 
                         families have paid bribes to stay 
                         out of the lottery?

               The King and Tyrian glance up at her.

                                     KING
                         Nonsense. By the power of this amulet, 
                         justly wielded by my hand in 
                         accordance with the laws of Urland, 
                         now lead be thou gold.

               The lead remains unchanged, but the King gives out a cry and 
               drops the amulet.

                                     KING
                         I'm burned! What devilish thing is 
                         this?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Have you ever kept my name off the 
                         lottery list?

                                     KING
                         That'll be all, Tyrian. You may 
                         withdraw.

               Tyrian bows and exits. The King uses his sceptre to pick up 
               the amulet and chain. He conceals it in a hollowed-out book 
               and places the volume on a shelf among many others.

                                     KING
                         Now, my dear, what's troubling you?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Answer my question: am I not exposed 
                         to the same risk as every other man's 
                         daughter?

               The King paces over to the window and stares out. The rain 
               has stopped.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Well?

                                     KING
                              (finally)
                         Your father loves you very much.

               Elspeth sways in dismay.

                                     ELSPETH
                              (a wail)
                         It's true! What have you done to 
                         me!?

                                     KING
                         Who fills your head with such ideas?

               At that moment a tremor passes through the room. King and 
               daughter look at each other in alarm.

               DUNGEON

               The same tremor shakes the bars in Galen's cell. Puzzled, he 
               rolls off his straw palette and gets to his feet. The tremor 
               dies away. Suddenly a violent shaking hits the cell, bouncing 
               Galen off the walls.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE SQUARE

               Swanscombe is gripped by the same earthquake. Dodging panicky 
               barnyard animals, Valerian and her father join other 
               frightened villagers in the center of town.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY

               Above the dragon's lair, boulders are shifting and grinding 
               together. Massive chunks of stone break loose and tumble 
               down the incline.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GALEN

               The shaking has stopped. Rock dust filters down from the 
               ceiling. Galen picks himself up and stares: the door to his 
               cell is off its hinges and is sagging open. He darts out.

               CORRIDOR

               Galen dashes along the hallway, rounds a corner and stops. 
               At the other end of the passage is Tyrian.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You little meddler! It's alive!

               He draws his sword and advances. Galen warily retreats. Tyrian 
               breaks into a run. Galen turns and sprints away.

               COURTYARD

               Unruly horses, terrified by the quake, rush blindly around 
               the courtyard. Hostlers try vainly to catch them. Tyrian 
               leans down from an upstairs window.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Close the main gate! Quick!

               The men below scramble for the gates. Galen bursts out of 
               hiding, sees the untended horses, and swings aboard as one 
               goes past. A cry goes up from the guards.

                                     TYRIAN
                         There! Stop him!

               Galen rides like mad for the exit, but he's a half-second 
               late: the doors boom shut in his face. He wheels the horse 
               around. The King's men are coming toward him with pikes. 
               Digging his heels into the horse's sides, he urges the animal 
               back across the courtyard, up the steps and right into the 
               building!

               THRONE ROOM

               Galen gallops into the empty chamber, knocking over the throne 
               and vaulting a table. Hot on his heels are armed soldiers. 
               He kicks the horse again and shoots under an archway.

               KITCHEN

               The kitchen is already in chaos from the earthquake when 
               Galen charges in on his wild steed. Food, utensils and cooks 
               go flying. He reins in, ducks his head, and squeezes the 
               horse out into a narrow hallway.

               HALLWAY

               He clatters down the passageway. But here comes a contingent 
               of footmen from the opposite direction. Galen rides them 
               into the walls!

               STAIRS

               The horse scrabbles up the stairs, Galen tucked low against 
               its neck. On the upper landing he comes face to face with 
               Tyrian and more soldiers.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Get him! Stab the horse!

               Galen jerks the animal around and plunges back down the 
               stairs.

               LIBRARY

               Whinnying and blowing the horse bursts in, a wild-eyed Galen 
               still in the saddle. He finds himself confronting the King 
               and his daughter.

               Casiodorus grabs Elspeth and retreats into a corner.

                                     KING
                         Tyrian! Tyrian!

               Tyrian sweeps in with his men. The doors slam shut.

                                     KING
                         So much for your magic! So much for 
                         your sorcery!

               Galen is trapped. Just as Tyrian reaches for the horse's 
               reins, the animal rears up, rolling its eyes. At that moment 
               the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks. The 
               men at arms go down like ten pins. Tyrian reels back, dodging 
               stone blocks loosened from the ceiling. As the shaking 
               continues, a weakened section of wall gives way. Galen sees 
               daylight! Without even waiting for the quake to cease, he 
               prods the horse across the room and through the wall to 
               freedom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               The unnerved citizens of Swanscombe gather on the promontory 
               overlooking Galen's landslide. Every few seconds there is a 
               new shudder and more rocks pour down the long slope. Valerian 
               stands trembling with her father. Presently Brother Jacopus 
               elbows his way forward.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Listen to me, my brethren. The moment 
                         of our fear is the moment of our 
                         triumph. This is a sign from God. 
                         Follow me, and our faith will send 
                         this creature straight to hell.

               Holding a cross before him, he starts up the slope. No one 
               follows. They haven't been Christians all that long. One or 
               two near Valerian get down on their knees and pray silently. 
               Greil looks things over.

                                     GREIL
                         You call yourselves Christians?

               He strides after the monk. But he's the only one.

               NEAR THE LAIR

               The determined monk has arrived at the epicenter. His sandals 
               are smoking on the hot gravel. Sweat shines on his face and 
               neck.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not 
                         want. Thou makest me to lie down in 
                         green pastures. Thy rod and staff 
                         they comfort me...

               Greil toils up the slope a hundred yards back. He's crossing 
               himself, but he's carrying a sickle.

               VERMITHRAX

               There is a thunderous noise. Part of the mountain is tossed 
               into the air. Up from the depths comes a huge shining wing. 
               Then a neck uncoils and a head appears. It tips down toward 
               the tiny human.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                              (firm)
                         ...for Thine is the kingdom and the 
                         power and the glory forever -- amen.

               At the base of the slope the villagers scatter. Greil wavers.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Unclean beast, get thee down! Be 
                         thou consumed by the fires that made 
                         you!

               The dragon's head sways back and forth, then belches out a 
               waterfall of flame. It engulfs Jacopus and sends him to a 
               better world, if there is one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HILL ROAD - NIGHT

               Horse and rider race across a night landscape under brooding 
               clouds. Up ahead, the sky glows with an angry red light. At 
               the crest of a hill Galen reins in and looks down across a 
               long valley. There, miles away, is the village of Swanscombe. 
               Many buildings are ablaze. As he watches in horror, fires 
               spring up in the fields and trees. Intermittently he can see 
               the silhouette of the dragon as it spreads destruction. 
               Finally the creature swoops up and away. Galen stares skyward, 
               losing sight of it in the clouds. For a moment, silence. 
               Then, with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him 
               from the saddle, the dragon reappears and hurtles a few feet 
               over his head! It is gone in an instant.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Half the buildings in the town are on fire. Desperate 
               villagers dash here and there, herding children and animals 
               to safety, trying to save their household goods. Galen walks 
               woodenly into the confusion, leading his horse, taking in 
               the scope of the disaster. He comes upon a line of men who 
               have formed a bucket brigade. He attempts to join up. As 
               soon as he is recognized, he is shouldered roughly aside.

                                     MAN
                         Get away, you little bastard. We've 
                         had enough help from you.

               Galen staggers back, reaching for his horse. The animal shies 
               and trots off. A middle-aged woman appears in front of him, 
               her face contorted with rage. She swings a flaming broom and 
               catches him on the back of the head. Galen reels away.

                                     WOMAN
                         This is your doing!

               Galen looks up and sees a couple of burlies moving his way 
               with boards in their hands.

                                     BURLIES
                         Get him! He's back!

               Before they can get too close, Galen runs down an alley and 
               bumps smack into a glassy-eyed, haunted man. It is Greil.

                                     GALEN
                         Greil -- help!

                                     GREIL
                         May the Lord forgive you for what 
                         you have done.

               He pushes past. Galen ducks behind a smoldering building.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               The roof has burned off, but at least the walls are standing. 
               Valerian is wrestling charred timbers out of the center of 
               the room. She is covered with soot. There is a hammering on 
               the door and Galen barges in. He slams the door behind him 
               and puts his back against it.

                                     GALEN
                         It's me. Are you hurt?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Where have you been? Doesn't matter -- 
                         listen: Quick! Make it rain. That'll 
                         put the fire out.

                                     GALEN
                         I can't.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Then get the animals back. They're 
                         all running loose. There's people 
                         been hurt. Stop their pain. You can 
                         cure them. And we'll need food...

                                     GALEN
                         I can't do it.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (this stops her)
                         What? Why not?

               Galen's hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang.

                                     GALEN
                         I just can't.

                                     VALERIAN
                         But you're a sorcerer.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I 
                         might have had, it's gone.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It can't be!

                                     GALEN
                         I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A 
                         fake. I'm sorry...

               For a moment, Valerian is too stunned to speak. Then her 
               face colors.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You're sorry?! Listen to that! The 
                         damn thing is loose, we're all on 
                         fire and you're sorry!

               Galen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You didn't have the faintest idea 
                         what you were doing, did you? You're 
                         a fool -- and I'm a bigger one for 
                         bringing you here.

               She snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't want you in this house. Get 
                         out.

               But Galen still sits there like a puppet with its strings 
               cut, every dream of glory utterly crushed. This piteous sight 
               touches Valerian's heart. Her gaze softens. She slowly lowers 
               the pitchfork.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               A knot of villagers lead Tyrian and his henchmen across the 
               square directly to the blacksmith's shop. The King's men 
               dismount and pound on the door. It swings open. Valerian is 
               standing there.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Where is he?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not here. I can't help you.

               A cry goes up from the villagers. They know damn well he's 
               in there.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               Tyrian pushes Valerian aside and steps into the room. Aided 
               by some townfolk, his men proceed to ransack the premises, 
               overturning barrels, sticking their swords through flour 
               sacks, poking through the tumbledown thatch. Valerian's eye 
               falls on Malkin, who has involved himself in the search.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You too?

                                     MALKIN
                              (returning her look)
                         Damn right.

               Finding nothing, the group pushes into the metal shop, where 
               Simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an 
               enormous anvil. He lays down his tools and grimly watches 
               the men go through, overturning benches and tables. Tyrian 
               props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to Simon.

                                     TYRIAN
                         As the proud new father of an eligible 
                         daughter who was some-how overlooked 
                         all these years, it may interest you 
                         to know that the King has called for 
                         a new lottery.

                                     SIMON
                         But it's months til the solstice.

                                     TYRIAN
                         In view of what's happened, we all 
                         know what's required.

                                     SIMON
                         I've never taken part in your cursed 
                         lottery, and I'll have nothing to do 
                         with it now.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You were very clever. But she'll 
                         take part, like all the rest. No 
                         exceptions.

               The search party has exhausted the room's hiding places.

                                     HENCHMAN
                         Nothing. If he was here, he's gone 
                         now.

               Tyrian nods and leads the way out. Simon catches up and pulls 
               Tyrian aside at the door.

                                     SIMON
                         All right. I know what you want. How 
                         much?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Are you offering me a bribe?

                                     SIMON
                         Yes.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Don't waste your time.
                              (pause)
                         You could never afford it.

               He spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out of 
               town. Valerian and Simon watch them go. When the riders are 
               out of sight, they return to the shop. With a couple of stout 
               poles, they strain to lift the anvil off its base. Finally 
               it topples over. Valerian slides the base aside, revealing a 
               trap door. She raises it and a cramped Galen unfolds himself 
               from the space below. On his face is a curious look of 
               determination.

                                     GALEN
                         Smith -- have you ever forged a 
                         weapon?

               WEAPONS

               Simon is going through a cabinet, tossing out hoes, rakes, 
               sickles, scythes, plow blades, and a knife or two. Galen 
               examines them doubtfully. Now Simon produces an armload of 
               swords. Galen is impressed; he looks them over carefully, 
               testing and rejecting them in turn.

                                     GALEN
                         These are your sharpest?

               Simon plucks up one of the swords, carries it to the center 
               of the room. He lays a horseshoe on the anvil. He brings the 
               sword down -- whack! -- and cuts the horseshoe in half.

                                     SIMON
                         Even Tyrian carries one of these.

               Galen hefts it dubiously.

                                     GALEN
                         It's sharp -- but it's not sharp 
                         enough.

               Valerian has been watching all this with growing concern.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not sharp enough for what?

                                     GALEN
                         For what I'm going to do with it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Nothing's that sharp.

               Simon gnaws his lip. Reluctantly, he brings a long box from 
               the bottom of the cabinet. He opens it. Lying on a bed of 
               silk is an exquisite two-handed broadsword. The flat blade 
               gleams like a mirror. Galen reaches in and lifts it out.

                                     SIMON
                         The best I ever made.

               Valerian is as awed as Galen.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's beautiful.

               Galen brings up a finger to test the edge. Simon grabs his 
               hand away.

                                     SIMON
                         Don't do that!
                              (he looks at Valerian)
                         Girl-child, when you were born I 
                         knew I had to do something, so I set 
                         about the task of fashioning an 
                         extraordinary weapon: I had the skill 
                         to make it --
                              (bleak pause)
                         -- but not the nerve to use it.

               She looks at him with affection. Leaning forward, she plants 
               a kiss on his bald pate.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm thankful for that.
                              (to Galen)
                         No man should choose a senseless 
                         death.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               Galen, Valerian and Simon tramp through a glade to a mossy 
               bank. There a wide stream flows lazily under a canopy of 
               trees.

                                     VALERIAN
                         If it's me you're worried about, 
                         don't. So my name has been entered, 
                         what of it? There are hundreds of 
                         girls. My name just won't be drawn. 
                         I know it won't.

               Galen walks out into the shallows and pushes the sword-tip 
               into the sandy bottom, angled so that the edge splits the 
               current.

                                     GALEN
                         Valerian, this isn't just for your 
                         sake.

               He walks back to shore. All three watch the sword to see 
               what will happen.

               SWORD

               Big flat oak leaves are gliding along the current. Very 
               slowly, they go by the sword, some of them very close. 
               Finally, one of them floats against the leading edge of the 
               blade and without a ripple is cleft in two. Simon gives Galen 
               a significant look.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't care. It doesn't matter. 
                         What you want to kill isn't flesh 
                         and blood.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, it'll bleed, all right.

                                     VALERIAN
                         How do you know? No one's so much as 
                         even scratched it.

               They look to Galen. The apprentice's face is full of doubt.

                                     GALEN
                         I'll need the amulet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KING'S CASTLE - NIGHT

               Carrying torches to light their way, families -- some with 
               maiden daughters -- gather from all over the country in the 
               courtyard of the King's castle. Simon is there with Valerian, 
               and so is Galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide-
               brimmed hat. Like many others, he carries a stick topped 
               with a bleached skull -- to all appearances, just another 
               participant in this weird pagan ritual. A barrel decorated 
               with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front 
               of the main entrance. Horsrik, the King's herald, supervises 
               preparations for the lottery. Armed guards appear carrying a 
               sealed chest. Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour 
               the contents -- hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the 
               name of a potential sacrifice -- into the barrel. Trumpets 
               blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage: 
               the King, his daughter, courtiers and Tyrian. Valerian nudges 
               Galen.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (pointing)
                         Look at her. The Princess.

                                     GALEN
                         I know. We've met.

               Valerian gives Galen a sharp look. Horsrik unrolls a 
               parchment.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (reading)
                         People of Urland: whereas the peace 
                         of the kingdom has been disrupted by 
                         the mischief of an interloper; and 
                         whereas this interloper being fled; 
                         now therefore, his majesty the King 
                         hereby proclaims the sum of thirty 
                         ducats to be paid to anyone producing 
                         the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud 
                         enchanter, to our satisfaction.

               Galen pulls his hat low over his eyes. As the moment for the 
               drawing approaches, Valerian becomes more and more uneasy. 
               She pushes forward through the crowd until she's just below 
               the barrel. She eyes the people around her. Some of them 
               seem equally worried, others -- the better dressed and better 
               fed -- are smug and complacent. The King and his retinue are 
               serene. A chant goes up from the crowd:

                                     CROWD
                         Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!

               Horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved 
               dragon's head and stirs up the names. This done, a new chant 
               goes up:

                                     CROWD
                         Bare the arm! Bare the arm!

               At a signal, a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from 
               Horsrik's right arm. He holds it high. The crowd surges 
               forward. The atmosphere is full of dread and excitement. 
               Valerian looking pale and determined, is jostled and pushed 
               to the edge of the platform.

                                     CROWD
                         Draw the name! Draw the name!

               The moment has come. Down goes Horsrik's arm and up it comes, 
               holding one little wooden square, one young woman's fate. An 
               expectant hush falls over the mob. The virgins of Urland 
               tremble and wait.

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now, my countrymen, hear me: behold, 
                         for I am chosen. I shall die that 
                         many may live. I shall lay down my 
                         life for family and fellows. I shall 
                         go to my grave for the love of our 
                         King and his wise policy. And my 
                         name is --

               He looks down at the tile to read the name, but no sound 
               comes to his lips. He looks back at the crowd, a cold sweat 
               breaking over his face. He swallows, but still can't bring 
               himself to speak. At his feet, Valerian is holding her breath. 
               A new chant goes up.

                                     CROWD
                         The name! The name!

               By now Horsrik is trembling. He stares down at the tile, his 
               mouth set in a grim line. The King is getting annoyed. He 
               gestures and the crowd falls silent.

                                     KING
                         Read the name.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (mastering himself)
                         The name is: Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, 
                         filia regis.

               There is a moment of profound shock. Then a low murmur of 
               wonder moves through the crowd. Galen looks at Valerian; she 
               sags with relief. The King turns to his daughter. She shows 
               nothing. He rises from his chair, comes forward and snatches 
               the tile from Horsrik.

                                     KING
                         That's not the name. It's been 
                         misread.

               Valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy.

                                     VALERIAN
                         There's no mistake! The name's been 
                         chosen -- let it stand!

                                     KING
                         No, the good Horsrik has misspoke 
                         himself.
                              (he looks at the tile)
                         In fairness to this individual, whose 
                         name I can't make out, we'll destroy 
                         this tile.

               He quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow. 
               Led by Valerian, the crowd cries out in protest.

                                     VALERIAN
                         No! What better name than your own 
                         kin? At last we see justice done!

                                     KING
                         Silence! We will have a new choosing. 
                         I will draw the name myself.

               He reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile. He 
               looks at it and his eyes widen. Betrayed, he swivels to face 
               his daughter. The din of the crowd reaches a crescendo.

                                     CROWD
                         Let it stand! Let it stand!

               Elspeth takes the tile from her father's nerveless fingers, 
               looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft.

                                     ELSPETH
                         The name is as you heard it and as 
                         Horsrik read it: Elspeth.

               The King moils through the tiles, finding his daughter's 
               name again and again.

                                     KING
                         The lottery is invalid. Another and 
                         another. What treachery is this?

               Valerian, chanting with the rest, falls silent. She looks at 
               Elspeth with sudden interest and respect, then awe.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Hear me, good people! It is true, 
                         that my name appears on many of the 
                         lots. This does not falsify the 
                         drawing, it certifies it! I have 
                         learned that my name has been kept 
                         from jeopardy in all the drawings in 
                         the past. So I have put my name among 
                         the rest many times -- once for each 
                         risk that, over the years, you took 
                         and I did not.

               The crowd is dumbfounded. Gradually voices erupt in a 
               cacophony of shouts, whistles and excited conversation. Galen 
               sees his chance: there's an unguarded door near the stable. 
               He drifts toward it and slips inside.

               THRONE ROOM

               Galen pokes his head in: the room is empty. He scurries over 
               to a chest, flings it open and starts rummaging. Finding 
               nothing he moves on to a cabinet. He breaks the lock and 
               pries it open. Again, nothing.

               CASTLE CORRIDOR

               Galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down 
               a hall. Suddenly he stops short. There in front of him is a 
               guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. Galen 
               hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves. 
               But the man is only headed for another window and a better 
               view. Galen manages to fall into step an arm's length behind 
               him and slip by without a sound.

               LIBRARY

               Galen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily 
               on the torchlit walls. Hurrying through, his attention is 
               drawn to some open books on a table. Closer inspection reveals 
               magical writings and symbols. Galen paws over everything, 
               suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet. But where 
               is it?

               COURTYARD

               As the crowd disperses Valerian watches Elspeth walk back in 
               the castle, lofty and composed. She looks for Galen and 
               discovers he has gone.

               LIBRARY

               By now, the room is in total disarray. Galen has opened all 
               the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the 
               shelves. No amulet. He's feverishly working on a locked drawer 
               when a voice interrupts him.

                                     KING
                         Don't go to all that trouble.

               Galen whirls around to find the King standing in the doorway. 
               The monarch looks shattered. Galen edges toward the split in 
               the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers. 
               At that moment Tyrian comes through the door, sizes up the 
               situation and draws his sword.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at 
                         least give me a weapon.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (pushing by the King)
                         I think not!

                                     KING
                         Stop! Don't harm him.
                              (to Galen)
                         And you -- don't run away... please...

               The King's voice is cracking. Galen and Tyrian are equally 
               taken aback. The King searches through the books remaining 
               on the library shelves.

                                     KING
                              (shaky)
                         I've always had the greatest 
                         admiration for the black arts. You 
                         chaps with your mysterious spells... 
                         I didn't think it would be necessary, 
                         you see. Vermithrax is an old dragon. 
                         And that, I thought, was the beauty 
                         of my plan -- buying time. We'd wait 
                         her out. I'd live to see the end of 
                         her.
                              (firm)
                         That's still going to happen.

               The King finds the book and takes the amulet out. With 
               trembling hands, he passes it to Galen.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Sire!

                                     KING
                         He shall have it.
                              (pleading)
                         It's my daughter. Save her, I beg 
                         you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - DAY

               The people of Swanscombe are clearing up the rubble and 
               beginning repairs on their dwellings. Standing in their midst, 
               lecturing every passerby, is Greil. He holds up the charred 
               remains of Brother Jacopus' wooden cross.

                                     GREIL
                         Holy of holies -- he did not die in 
                         vain. Can you hear me, brothers?

               Some workmen go by lugging new thatch. Malkin is with them.

                                     MALKIN
                              (gently)
                         We hear you, Greil.

                                     GREIL
                         Well and good, but I'm Greil no 
                         longer. Call me Gregorius, after the 
                         Bishop of Rome.

               Malkin and the others stop to listen.

                                     GREIL
                         I saw him die. Like Our Lord Jesus 
                         on the cross he was, scourged by 
                         evil. But he showed no fear. Such is 
                         the power of the Holy Ghost.

               BLACKSMITH SHOP

               Galen lurks in the shadows of Simon's metal shop looking out 
               on the square where Greil is holding forth.

                                     GREIL
                         Of what avail is magic? The old gods 
                         died with our daughters. From whence 
                         comest my help? My help comest from 
                         the Lord!

               Galen quietly shuts and bars the door. He moves deeper into 
               the gloomy workroom where Simon is pumping a bellows to heat 
               up the forge. Galen looks at the coals.

                                     SIMON
                         Good and hot.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't bother. That's not the kind of 
                         fire we need.

               Valerian is staring at the sword, sitting on the anvil in 
               its silk wrapping. Galen uncovers it, holds it high, and 
               puts his hand on the amulet.

                                     GALEN
                         Nunc, per Potestatem Hermeticum -- 
                         ex flammis, ferrum sangrinarium!

               The sword starts to hum and to heat up. From the hilt outward 
               the blade glows brighter and brighter: red, orange, white. 
               It lights up the room, throwing long shadows into the corners. 
               Galen lays the white hot steel on the anvil. Simon takes up 
               his hammer and begins the reforging. Valerian sees their 
               resolve. After watching for several moments she slips out 
               the side door, looking sad.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Clouds scud low over the lifeless region. The dragon's lair 
               now has a newer, bigger entrance. Vapors drift upward from 
               it. Down the slope a lonely figure works its way from rock 
               to rock: it's Valerian with a wicker basket on her arm, 
               searching for dragon scales. The basket is already more than 
               half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of 
               the cavern. She's about to turn back when she spies a 
               particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards 
               further on. As she reaches for it, there is a sudden hiss! 
               She jerks her hand back and freezes. There in the shadows is 
               a baby dragon, a basilisk, all coppery bronze with stubby 
               winglets. As she backs away, she sees two more come up to 
               join the first. They watch her retreat through wicked little 
               green eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               On the mossy bank Galen and Simon unwrap the reforged sword. 
               Now the blade carries a faint blue halation. Galen walks to 
               the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip down 
               into the sand. Then he rejoins Simon onshore to await results. 
               This time, as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge, they 
               gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact. Such 
               is the power of the sword that even after many leaves, not a 
               single one has come close enough to be sliced. Simon is agog 
               and even Galen seems satisfied. They clasp hands.

                                     SIMON
                         An edge like no other on this earth.

                                     GALEN
                         Well done, Simon. Thank you.

               Simon hands him a bundle of fighting equipment.

                                     SIMON
                              (grave)
                         I'll say goodbye to Valerian for 
                         you. I'm sorry she's not here, but 
                         you know how she is.

                                     GALEN
                         I understand.

               They look at each other for what could be the last time.

                                     SIMON
                         Fare thee well.

               The old man departs. Galen unfolds the bundle and brings out 
               its contents: mail hauberk with coif, studded leather gloves, 
               padded jerkin, a scabbard and a small wooden shield. He lays 
               them out on the stream bank, then strips off his tunic and 
               kneels down to splash some water in his face. As the cups 
               the water between his hands, an image comes alive and shimmers 
               on the surface: Valerian, stripping off her own clothes, 
               shyly turning toward him, solemn and romantic.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen.

               It's as if the vision is speaking to him, but it's not. He 
               spins around and sees her standing there, fully clothed, and 
               possessed of a brisk and businesslike air.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Here.

               She throws down a shield. It's remarkable in its construction -- 
               overlapping layers of iridescent dragon scales have been 
               ingeniously fastened to a leather-clad frame.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's a shield. I made it. Might keep 
                         the fire off you. Might not. You 
                         know, you're an idiot. You're going 
                         to die tonight. You'll be ripped 
                         limb from limb. This is the last 
                         time I'll ever speak to you.

               Galen turns the shield over and over, marveling at it. He 
               fixes her with a piercing look.

                                     GALEN
                         Thank you.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (rushing)
                         Another thing. That thing isn't alone 
                         up there. There's little ones. Young, 
                         I think. I don't know how many.

               She shudders. Galen's eyes are still fastened on her. She's 
               fighting to retain her hard manner, but the agitation and 
               dread are plain.

                                     GALEN
                         Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed 
                         too. Anything else?

               Valerian wants to be bold, but on this final point, can't 
               muster the courage.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (tiny voice)
                         You're in love, aren't you?

                                     GALEN
                              (slowly nodding)
                         Yes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's all right. I understand. She's 
                         very beautiful, very brave.

                                     GALEN
                         Who is? What do you mean?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Your Princess. But I don't care. It 
                         doesn't change the way I feel.
                              (firm)
                         Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn, 
                         sorcerer's apprentice; you're going 
                         to be dead, the dragon will be worse 
                         than ever, there will be more 
                         lotteries, and I'm not a boy any 
                         more.

                                     GALEN
                         And you'll be eligible because --

                                     VALERIAN
                         Because I'm still a virgin, and I 
                         want you to do something about it.

               Galen takes her in his arms; she is trembling. He tilts her 
               face up toward his and kisses her.

                                     GALEN
                         I am in love. But not with the 
                         Princess.

               Their image is reflected in the waters. Through the ripples 
               she is visible pulling briefly away to remove her clothes.

               From afar, they are two tiny figures under the overarching 
               oaks and willows. They embrace and sink down into the deep 
               grass beside the water. The leaves continue their unhurried 
               course downstream.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT

               A cold wind whistles through the rocks near the dragon's 
               lair. By the light of a flickering torch two workmen finish 
               driving a heavy post into the ground. As they affix a pair 
               of iron manacles they see the torches of a procession coming 
               up the slope. They hurry down to meet it. Horsrik is in the 
               lead, followed by soldiers and royal attendants. Elspeth 
               rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse. Bringing up 
               the rear is Tyrian. At last the cart can go no further. 
               Elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post. 
               As the soldiers put the irons around her wrists, Horsrik 
               unrolls a parchment, turns his back on the wind and begins 
               to read:

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom, that the Princess, having 
                         been chosen by a deed of fortune and 
                         destiny --

               Horsrik blinks. There's a black stain growing in the middle 
               of the parchment; all at once it bursts into flames. He cries 
               out and flings the document away. There follows a flash of 
               light and a puff of smoke and Galen is standing there, as if 
               he had materialized out of thin air. Horsrik and his startled 
               men backpedal down the slope.

                                     HORSRIK
                         No fire, I beg you.

               Galen raises his hands in a menacing gesture.

                                     GALEN
                         Be gone!

               That's enough for Horsrik and company: he and the soldiers 
               depart.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (over his shoulder)
                         I declare these proceedings duly 
                         ordained...

               Only one man remains behind the challenge the young sorcerer: 
               Tyrian. He draws his sword.

                                     TYRIAN
                         I knew I'd find you here. Well, I'm 
                         not as sentimental as some. The 
                         kingdom, every one of us, need this 
                         sacrifice. If you intend to interfere, 
                         you'll have to kill me.

                                     GALEN
                         I've got plenty of reasons to kill 
                         you that have nothing to do with 
                         this sacrifice.

               Galen draws his own sword. As it emerges into the night air 
               it seems imbued with a blue phosphorescence.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Most impressive. Can you use it?

               Elspeth twists around in her chains.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Let it be! Please! Tyrian is right -- 
                         it's our only hope!

               Galen starts to reply, but as soon as his attention wavers, 
               Tyrian is lunging toward him, sword point directed at his 
               neck. Galen barely manages to parry the thrust before Tyrian 
               is at him again, blade swinging toward his knees. Galen drops 
               the tip of his sword to catch the blow. When the two steel 
               edges connect, sparks fly. In a series of thrusts and counter-
               thrusts, each accompanied by a shower of sparks, Tyrian backs 
               Galen up the mountain.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Tyrian -- both of you -- run! Flee! 
                         It's coming!

               Sure enough, at that moment the earth gives out a low moan 
               and undulates in a sickening movement. Vapors begin rising 
               from the lair.

                                     TYRIAN
                         In a trice! This is no swords-man.

               He might be right, for Galen turns and bolts across the slope. 
               When he reaches the post with Tyrian two steps behind, he 
               whirls and brings his blade down on Princess Elspeth's chains. 
               The chains part in an explosion of sparks.

                                     GALEN
                         Run! Get out of here!

               The Princess darts from the piling as Tyrian swoops down to 
               continue the attack. Galen dodges and the stake catches 
               Tyrian's blow. The earth shakes again. Galen glances at the 
               Princess.

                                     GALEN
                         No! Stop! What are you doing?

               Elspeth is not running away down the mountain. Instead she 
               is walking, slowly and deliberately, right into the smoking 
               cave. Swoosh! Tyrian's sword comes down again. The dismayed 
               sorcerer ducks back and Tyrian's blade again bites deep into 
               the wood.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You've failed, my friend, and I thank 
                         the gods for it. Come out from behind 
                         that post.

               It's now or never. Elspeth is no longer in sight. Galen grits 
               his teeth, grasps the sword with two hands and swings it as 
               hard as he can in a wide arc. The blade never even slows 
               down as it sails right through the post, lopping it clean 
               off. The glowing sword flashes above Galen's head and eagerly 
               buries itself in Tyrian's chest. The King's man is as startled 
               by the amputated piling as he is by his own death. His eyes 
               roll up in his head, his knees buckle and he topples backward -- 
               the blade sliding free.

               DRAGON'S LAIR

               Smoke swirls at the mouth of the cave as Galen enters, holding 
               his sword before him, lighting his way with its faint blue 
               glow.

                                     GALEN
                         Elspeth!

               The floor of the cave as it winds down into the mountain is 
               paved first with rock, then with dragon scales, then with 
               bones. With each footfall, clusters of mysterious insects 
               scuttle away. Galen pauses to mop his brow; it's getting 
               hot. A sound echoes up from the depths, a grinding sound 
               like the gnashing of teeth, followed by hissing and squealing. 
               Galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on. Suddenly he 
               stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper: Elspeth's. The 
               grinding sounds are louder. He hurries forward and rounds a 
               corner. He stops and gags.

               BASILISKS

               Two disgusting little reptiles -- like scaly raccoons -- are 
               perched on the corpse of Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, feeding 
               contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh. Galen groans: 
               he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters.

               The other one buzzes its half-formed winglets and hisses a 
               hot stream of air. Galen brings down the sword and slices it 
               in half. Eyes riveted on Elspeth's remains, he edges around 
               the carnage and backs away. Hissss! -- there's a third one, 
               lurking in the shadows, munching on something; it might be a 
               hand. Galen shrieks and jumps away. The little creature comes 
               at him and clamps its jaws on his leg. Galen stabs at it 
               repeatedly. Finally it lets go, and flails and flops across 
               the bloody floor, ululating its death agony. As the creature's 
               last mewlings echo down through the cavern, the ground 
               quivers. Bits of stone fall from the ceiling.

               LAKE OF FIRE

               Galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are 
               alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water. As before, 
               he holds the sword in front of him; he marvels at its 
               increasing brightness. The heat is increasing too; sweat 
               mats his hair and runs down his face. A few yards further on 
               the sword starts pulsating. Now the walls take on a flickering 
               rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista 
               of staggering immensity: an underground lake, its surface 
               bubbling and torn with sheets of flame. Arching over it is a 
               vault of stone, penetrated here and there by natural chimneys. 
               The dimensions of this internal world are unknown -- the 
               fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers. The 
               one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones 
               leading across the hot liquid. Galen grips his sword and 
               resolutely hops from rock to rock.

               VERMITHRAX

               He's halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping 
               stones teeter beneath his feet. A fiery wave washes over his 
               legs, leaving his boots smoking. Another tremor knocks Galen 
               to his knees. As he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield, 
               the great head of Vermithrax rises up out of the depths on 
               its long neck. It gazes at him through huge pale eyes under 
               armored lids. A tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless 
               mouth. The head sways from side to side. The mouth hinges 
               open, the nostril-like igniters come on and touch off the 
               jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards. A roaring tube of 
               flame engulfs Galen. He crouches behind his dragon scale 
               shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life. 
               The dragon pauses to take a breath. Galen springs to his 
               feet, and bounds back the way he came, his skin and clothing 
               singed. Flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with 
               a second burst.

               TUNNEL

               Coughing and weeping, Galen staggers up through the tunnel, 
               nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons. A 
               few seconds later, Vermithrax follows, squirming and clawing 
               its way upward. When it reaches its dead offspring it surveys 
               the scene with expressionless eyes. Bringing its head low, 
               it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones.

               AMBUSH

               At that moment Galen leaps out from behind a niche in the 
               tunnel wall and lunges forward. Striking sparks, the point 
               of his sword slides across the dragon's plated cheek and 
               stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck. There is an 
               unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and 
               upward. Galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half 
               a sword. The rest is buried in the beast's neck, and 
               Vermithrax doesn't like it. It flings its head this way and 
               that, knocking rocks loose from the ceiling. Its movements 
               cause the ground to quake. As boulders tumble around him, 
               Galen drops to the floor under his shield. Dragon flame 
               reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DAWN

               Valerian roams the rock-strewn slope not far from the dragon's 
               lair. Presently she comes upon a once-familiar object -- the 
               fire shield. Half the scales are gone, the rest are charred 
               and curling. Grimly, she moves on. A few paces away she picks 
               up the blunted sword. She scans the rocks and finally sees 
               what she's looking for.

               GALEN

               He's lying face down behind a boulder, his clothes charred, 
               patches of skin scorched. He looks dead. Valerian rolls him 
               onto his back. She gasps: the eyes are open, regarding her.

                                     GALEN
                         Still alive.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               Simon is standing by the anvil with the broken sword in his 
               hand, lost in thought.

               HOUSE

               In the adjoining house Valerian tends Galen's wounds. He's 
               propped up on a palette enduring the application of poultices.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You know what we have to do.
                              (he looks at her with 
                              dull eyes)
                         We have to leave Urland.

               He winces in pain.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not because of what happened. I 
                         brought you here -- it didn't work -- 
                         now I'm taking you away. Do you 
                         understand?
                              (Galen does not react)
                         You said you loved me. Is it true? 
                         If it is, it's the only good we've 
                         done. Let's not lose that too.
                              (pause)
                         Galen?

               He seems miles away. She turns aside, on the verge of tears. 
               Simon is standing there, still holding the sword hilt.

                                     SIMON
                         She's right. What kind of a life 
                         could you have here? It's too late 
                         for me, but you're young enough.
                              (he shows them the 
                              sword)
                         You know what I think? Magic is dying 
                         out, fading from the world. But that 
                         makes me happy. That means the dragon 
                         will be dying too.

               Galen looks at him; he has heard everything. He sits up and 
               fondly regards Valerian.

               PACKING

               Valerian packs her belongings into a rucksack. The last item 
               in is her blue frock, carefully rolled. Beside her, Galen 
               dons clean traveling clothes. He stiffly crosses the room 
               and drags his pack out of the corner. He sorts through the 
               effects, and amidst the clothing and supplies discovers the 
               leather pouch containing Ulrich's remains. He contemplates 
               it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's that?

                                     GALEN
                         Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor 
                         Hodge.

               He tucks the pouch away, throws some clothes on top and ties 
               the satchel shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               Beside the quiet stream Simon bids farewell to the young 
               couple, embracing each in turn. They slosh across the shallow 
               water and follow a path into the woods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

               Greil is standing outside the half-burned grange hall, 
               summoning the Christian faithful. He proclaims the call to 
               worship by hammering on a small bell. One by one the townsfolk 
               arrive. Among them is Simon, looking bereft.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FOREST PATH - DAY

               Valerian and Galen trudge along side by side.

                                     VALERIAN
                         How's your leg?

                                     GALEN
                         Hurts. That thing was small, but its 
                         teeth were sharp.

                                     VALERIAN
                         At least you killed it. You got all 
                         the young.

               This is small consolation, and Galen sighs.

                                     GALEN
                         But the big one's alive. Somewhere 
                         down in that burning lake.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Don't think about it. You had your 
                         fight, and you're still here. That's 
                         more than anyone else can say. Let's 
                         think about what lies ahead.

               She reaches out to take his hand. But Galen is no longer at 
               her side. She stops and looks back.

               GALEN

               Galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path. He's 
               staring into the middle distance with a sudden inspiration 
               bubbling in his brain. He flings off his sack, drops to his 
               knees and tears through the contents. Valerian comes back, 
               baffled. Galen's gear is strewn all over the trail.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What are you doing?

               Galen comes up with what he's looking for -- the leather 
               sack. When he replies, it is not to her, but to Ulrich:

                                     GALEN
                         You old trickster! The burning water! 
                         The lake of fire!

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen, what are you saying?

               He regards her with astonishment.

                                     GALEN
                         He had it planned. He knew this was 
                         going to happen.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Who did? What happened?

                                     GALEN
                         We've got to go back, I want to talk 
                         to him!

               He heads back down the trail, leaving his belongings on the 
               road.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Where are you going?

               She hurries after him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               Greil, a.k.a. Gregorious, stands in the center of the burned-
               out granary, delivering a sermon. Behind him, men are filling 
               the baptismal cistern.

                                     GREIL
                         The Church is mother to us all. Not 
                         just one lonely orphan who has lost 
                         his way, not just a few, but all of 
                         us that believeth in Him. When enough 
                         voices come together in prayer, He 
                         shall hear, we shall live and the 
                         beast shall die.

               In the gathering Simon ponders the hilt of his once fabulous 
               sword. With its blade shortened, it looks a lot like a 
               crucifix.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Galen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage, 
               trailed by a desperate Valerian.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen, stop! Please, I beg you!

               But Galen pays no attention. In a burst of speed and fury, 
               Valerian comes up behind and tackles him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Stop! I won't let you kill yourself.

               Galen waves the leather pouch in Valerian's face.

                                     GALEN
                         He couldn't walk -- he knew he 
                         couldn't make the journey. So he had 
                         us make the journey for him! Don't 
                         you see?

               He jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (pursuing)
                         No!

               She tackles him again.

                                     VALERIAN
                         All right, all right. You're going 
                         in there, I'm going too.

                                     GALEN
                              (brought up short)
                         What? Why? No you're not, this is my 
                         job. Absolutely not.

               But Valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm not afraid. And you're not going 
                         to stop me. After all -- I've been a 
                         man longer than you have.

               Galen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near 
               the remains of the wooden stake, then charges after her.

               UNDERGROUND

               Running footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and Galen 
               comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the 
               way. Valerian stumbles after him. He grabs her hand.

                                     GALEN
                         Stay close.

               Down and down they go. Soon they reach Elspeth's body.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's that?

                                     GALEN
                         Never mind. Come on.

               But she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see.

                                     GALEN
                         All right. Wait here.

               He darts off. In the flickering torchlight Valerian can see 
               the Princess' remains all too clearly. She suppresses a 
               scream.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen? Galen? Where are you?

               No answer. The torch reveals several passages. She doesn't 
               know which one to take.

               LAKE OF FIRE

               The passage widens out and once again Galen is standing on 
               the shores of the lake of fire. He looks around. The water 
               is rolling with bubbles of gas, and flames run hither and 
               yon across the surface, but there is no sign of the dragon. 
               Gathering his courage, he hops across the stepping stones to 
               the middle of the lake. There he hurriedly opens the pouch.

                                     GALEN
                         Ex favilla, vita nova!

               Gripping the amulet with his free hand, he scatters Ulrich's 
               ashes in a wide arc over the burning water. Instantly, there 
               is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug. But no 
               wizard appears. No dragon, either. There follows another and 
               stronger quake. Galen crouches to keep his balance. Still no 
               wizard.

               OUTSIDE

               Thoroughly bewildered, Valerian stumbles out into daylight. 
               She wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against 
               the stake. Something is strange: it's getting dark. Squinting 
               up at the sun, she frowns in puzzlement, then gapes at what 
               is happening.

               ECLIPSE

               Slowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides 
               over the face of the sun, plunging the world into crepuscular 
               half-light.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               The congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden 
               darkness.

                                     GREIL
                         Be calm. He watcheth over us! And 
                         this is His sign! Let us pray! Our 
                         Father who art in heaven...

               The faithful bow their heads and join in. Simon as well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LAKE OF FIRE

               The earthquakes have subsided; the water is calm. Galen stares 
               bleakly into the flames. As he watches, they gather themselves 
               into a lazy spiral. Gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes 
               a vortex. Now the flames become tinged with green, and as 
               the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air, a form takes 
               shape at the crest of a jet of flame. It is Ulrich, supine 
               as upon his pyre, reforming before Galen's eyes.

                                     GALEN
                         Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can 
                         see you! Over here!

                                     ULRICH
                              (looks at him)
                         Not so loud. I'm not deaf, you know.

               He slowly raises himself into an upright posture and strides 
               through the flames.

                                     ULRICH
                         Sic redit magus ex terra mortis.

               The apprentice throws himself at his master's feet.

                                     GALEN
                         Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I 
                         thank the powers that made me!

                                     ULRICH
                         Glad to see you, too. You didn't 
                         bring along anything to eat, by any 
                         chance?

                                     GALEN
                         Food?

                                     ULRICH
                         No? Oh well, no time anyway.

               OUTSIDE

               Valerian is standing in the unearthly twilight, anxiously 
               peering into the mouth of the lair. Suddenly she is hit from 
               behind by a gust of wind. She does not turn to see the 
               enormous Vermithrax alighting silently behind her.

               GALEN & ULRICH

               Ulrich raises Galen to his feet.

                                     ULRICH
                         Come along. There's much to be done.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait, I have something to tell you.

                                     ULRICH
                         It can wait.

                                     GALEN
                         No it can't. Listen: I thought I was 
                         a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought 
                         I had power -- but I didn't. I thought 
                         I was you -- but I'm not.

               He hangs his head. Ulrich regards him steadily.

                                     ULRICH
                         Well said. Now hurry.

               He leads the way across the rocks to the shore and into the 
               tunnel.

               VALERIAN

               Time seems to have come to a stop. Overhead, the moon is 
               locked in front of the sun. At the lair, Valerian stands 
               frozen as the dragon leans over her. The great head sways 
               from side to side. The jaws hinge open. Suddenly, Valerian 
               recovers herself and makes a run for it, leaping and 
               scrabbling over the rocks. A plume of flame licks at her 
               heels. She sees a protective crevice and heads for it, but a 
               winged claw drops to block her way. She changes direction 
               and is cut off again. Cat and mouse.

               VERMITHRAX

               The pale yellow eyes stare implacably down at the hopeless 
               victim. The igniter jets come on, then off, as the beast 
               suddenly stiffens. The head rotates, almost as if catching a 
               new scent. Finally the eyes focus on the entrance to the 
               cavern.

               ULRICH

               There is the sorcerer, leaning on Galen, coolly regarding 
               the creature. The old man's expression hardens.

                                     ULRICH
                         Draco draconis...

               The dragon lifts its wings as if to menace them, then flaps 
               twice and is airborne. The thing shoots overhead and, with a 
               rush of wind, flies off into the gloom.

               IN THE ROCKS

               Valerian struggles out of her hiding place.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen!

               Galen runs to her. They embrace. When they look up, Ulrich 
               is at their side.

                                     ULRICH
                         Where's my amulet? Give it to me, 
                         please.

               Galen's hand locates the jewel under his shirt. He finds 
               himself reluctant to part with it.

               With a hurricane howl, a column of flame touches down nearby 
               and rushes toward them. They stagger back as the dragon sweeps 
               past.

                                     ULRICH
                         Be quick!

               Galen hands his treasure over. Ulrich closes his hand around 
               it.

                                     ULRICH
                         Come close to me.

               Galen and Valerian approach. The old man's hand is suffused 
               with an internal glow. Behind them, the dragon is turning 
               for another pass.

               VORTEX

               All at once the glow brightens, and in another instant the 
               world spins off into a blur, setting all three afloat in a 
               timeless netherworld. Valerian and Galen cling to each other 
               in terror.

                                     ULRICH
                         Don't be afraid. You have served me 
                         with great courage. Now you must 
                         show me you have even more.

                                     GALEN
                         Anything!

               The voices seem to be coming from a huge distance. Starlike 
               gleams whiz by, and fleeting glimpses of half-recognizable 
               faces and forms. The wizard's eyes are like glittering 
               crystals. Tiny motes and planetoids dance in the hairs of 
               his beard. He seems wreathed in luminescence.

                                     ULRICH
                         You must destroy the amulet, and me 
                         along with it.

                                     GALEN
                         No!

                                     ULRICH
                         You brought me from the flames, you 
                         must send me back.

                                     GALEN
                         I can't.

                                     ULRICH
                         When the time comes, you'll 
                         understand. Here.

               He dangles the amulet in front of Galen. Even more reluctantly 
               than he let it go, he takes it back.

               MOUNTAIN TOP

               Abruptly, the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a 
               rocky crag overlooking the eclipse-darkened fields and farms 
               of Urland. Galen glances at his surroundings and stares at 
               the amulet, full of awe.

                                     ULRICH
                         I know what you're thinking. You 
                         have learned much and done well. 
                         Don't worry, you won't need it any 
                         more.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               Greil is urging Simon, the last of the converts, into the 
               cistern.

                                     GREIL
                         Make haste, brother.

               He dips Simon's head under water.

                                     GREIL
                         Now be thou baptized in the name of 
                         the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. May 
                         the Lord our God light our way.

               In the background, half the congregation is staring through 
               the burned-out walls, fervently praying and crossing 
               themselves, wondering if they'll ever see the sun again. A 
               cry goes up: a shape crosses the solar corona, wheels over 
               the village and streaks away toward the mountains -- the 
               dragon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOUNTAIN TOP

               Galen and Valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch 
               Ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff. The 
               old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back.

                                     ULRICH
                         Nimbus! Tempestas! Fulmen!

               From over the horizon roiling inky-black clouds churn down 
               upon them. Thunder booms and echoes. A bitter wind whips 
               their clothing. As the storm gathers fury, the dragon 
               reappears, circling in the distance. Finally it homes in on 
               the mountain crag and dives at Ulrich. The conjurer makes a 
               gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beast's 
               scaly flanks. It emits a high thin scream and rockets past.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               Valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of 
               granite.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Here. Do as he said. Smash it.

                                     GALEN
                         Not if it means killing him.

               ULRICH

               He resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds 
               and starts another pass. Again, the sorcerer summons lightning 
               bolts. But the dragon keeps coming; this time a talon splits 
               the old man's cape.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               Valerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to 
               the ground.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You heard what he said.

               She lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it.

                                     GALEN
                         No! You can't!

               THE LAST ATTACK

               Vermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. 
               Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds 
               his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the 
               creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the 
               master magician away in its huge hind claw.

                                     ULRICH
                         Galen!

               Galen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling 
               upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As 
               the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear 
               Ulrich's faint screams.

               DEATH

               Now Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from 
               Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He 
               takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then 
               brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding 
               flash as it shatters into a million fragments.

               Far above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly 
               body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened 
               sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the 
               dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian 
               torch plummets to the ground.

               LAKE

               Below, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing 
               a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the 
               water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               They stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further 
               explosions boil the water from the pond.

               ECLIPSE

               Behind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a 
               pale sun.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               THE CARCASS - DAY

               Grey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen 
               and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened 
               wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to 
               the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside 
               down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise. 
               The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward 
               them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of 
               Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the 
               hulk. The song ends.

                                     GREIL
                         Let us pray.

               The members of the congregation fall to their knees.

                                     GREIL
                         We thank thee, Lord, for this divine 
                         deliverance. Verily is thy presence 
                         amongst us, fully manifest in this, 
                         thy great work.

               Galen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand.

                                     GREIL
                         Arise, children of the Lord and 
                         forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. 
                         Rejoice in the true power of the 
                         Christian God!

               Galen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the 
               mist.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               FLENSING - DAY

               In the clear light of a new day, ladders have been tipped up 
               against the creature's back. Teams of men swarm over the 
               crusted flesh, slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial. 
               Below, yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges. In 
               the background other workmen dump the remains into an open 
               pit.

               THE KING

               With the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal 
               coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. A door creaks open 
               and King Casiodorus totters out. His face is puffy, his eyes 
               are red. He slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon 
               and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. Horsrik 
               steps out of the coach and draws himself up.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (loud)
                         All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon 
                         slayer!

               The workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement 
               and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. Wordlessly they 
               resume their labors.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (nodding)
                         Hail and praise be!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               ON THE ROAD - DAY

               The trail leads through copses and open meadows. Side by 
               side, Galen and Valerian march up a long slope under a hot 
               sun. He limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You want to rest?

                                     GALEN
                         No. I'm fine.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You miss Ulricn.

                                     GALEN
                         Yes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         And the amulet.

                                     GALEN
                         That too.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad 
                         you did what you did.
                              (he doesn't reply)
                         You may not be a sorcerer, Galen, 
                         but I love you anyway. I don't regret 
                         anything that happened. I just wish --

                                     GALEN
                         Yes?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (sighs)
                         -- that we had a horse.

               Galen falls a step behind. He briefly closes his eyes and 
               mutters something. They walk on a few paces. Then there is a 
               whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters 
               forth. It crosses a meadow, comes right up to Valerian and 
               nuzzles her.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What is this?

                                     GALEN
                         A horse.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Did you...!?

                                     GALEN
                         No. It must have been wandering loose. 
                         Or wild.

               Galen climbs aboard. He reaches out to help her up.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Wait a minute. I just wished for a 
                         horse and here it is.

                                     GALEN
                         You don't want to wish it gone, do 
                         you?

               She thinks for a moment, then lets him help her up. Galen 
               touches the horse's flanks with his heels and they ride off.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY

          Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station
          make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
          ghost town âcept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
          ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
          how long ago this place went dry.
          Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
          PLUMES of dust skyward.

          INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY

          Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
          FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
          MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and
          FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Goddamned old man!

                         FUCKING PASSENGER
          I thought he was dead! She said he
          was dead!

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I don't see him. Just go. I think
          we lost him.

          EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY

          They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for
          the main road in the distance when they round a corner --
          --to face a â70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine
          screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because
          these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before:

                         MILTON
          âThe Old Manâ, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner,
          locks the tires and spins the wheel.
          The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM!
          The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would

                         BUT:
          MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window.
          Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN -
          Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it:
          TITLE CARD appears--

                         "DRIVE ANGRY"
          --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the
          words right at us!

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up,
          SLAMS the windshield.
          Truck CAREENS out of control!
          Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
          KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
          Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
          SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
          The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
          The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
          dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
          Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
          Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
          Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
          Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
          --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger
          screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --

          KER-ACK!
          -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard.
          Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.

          OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER
          Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to
          his feet and runs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver
          SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
          got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
          windshield. He looks up --
          -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I'll never tell you where they've
          taken her...NEVER.

                         MILTON
          I know.
          The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.

          ON FUCKING DRIVER
          As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
          of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
          at Milton standing over him.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          You...you took my leg you fuck!
          Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Wait. Wait!

                         MILTON
          Where is she?

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          I...I don't...
          Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
          up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
          Milton spins and KAFOOM!
          Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I
          don't know where exactly. They
          call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I
          know. I swear!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a
          moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          But you're too late. You gotta
          know that. Next full moon she's
          dead. Nothing you can do. She's
          dead and hell will walk the earth--

          WHAM!
          Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
          breaking a couple teeth in the process.
          Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
          his thirst in a decade.

                         MILTON
          You tell him I'm coming. You got
          that? I'm coming to get her back.
          You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna
          kill every last one of you fuckers.
          Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't
          look back.

          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.
          It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot
          dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound â67
          GTO stands out.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
          those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
          PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
          couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
          Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
          kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
          joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
          scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.

                         PIPER
          So I tell him, I says, âFrank,
          that's it. No more free milk. You
          gonna have to buy the cow you son
          of a bitch.â

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         NORMAJEAN
          But you're not fat, Piper

                         PIPER
          Wha? No, NormaJean, âbuy the cow.â
          Marry me? He's got to marry me.
          I'm sayin I cut him off.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You cut him off?

                         PIPER
          Not just yes but hell yes! No
          tits, no ass. And I told him if I
          see that big ol' dick of his
          anywhere near my face I'm gonna
          bite it in half.
          Normajean giggles with embarrassment.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You said that? How long's it been?
          Piper frowns.

                         PIPER
          Well, it's only been two days but
          that's like a decade in horny
          fucker years.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So he bought you a diamond?

                         PIPER
          A diamond? God no. If Frank had
          money for a diamond I would have
          jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
          put this shithole life in the rear
          view. But he did get down on his
          knees and ask me to be his bride.

                         NORMAJEAN
          No way.

                         PIPER
          Yes way!
          NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Oh! Piper!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         PIPER

          I KNOW!

          FF-FF-FFUMP!
          Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
          Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.

                         PIPER
          Did...did you just throw scrambled
          eggs at us?

                         FAT LOU
          I don't pay you bitches to stand
          around. Now get the fuck back to work!
          Piper snatches one of the plates.
          She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
          toward the newly arrived customers.
          The American Indian couple scans a menu...
          ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
          NormaJean steps up to Milton.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Hello beautiful, coffee?

                         MILTON
          That'd be great. Tell me,
          Stillwater Marsh around here?

                         NORMAJEAN
          (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
          a bell. I'll get that coffee.
          But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
          She quickly looks away. She knows something...
          Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
          --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.

                         PIPER
          Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
          you something to drink?

                         MOTHER MARY
          We'll take this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.

                         PIPER
          âShe's a Brickhouseâ breakfast.
          Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.

                         MOTHER MARY
          And five waters.

                         PIPER
          Five waters. And what can I get for...
          Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.

                         MOTHER MARY
          That's it. Just the pancakes. If
          that's okay?
          Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
          they're hungry. And broke.

                         PIPER
          Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
          Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
          Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
          attention. She's ignoring him.
          Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.

                         PIPER
          One brickhouse.
          She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
          kept fresh within a glass cake stand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.

                         MILTON
          Stillwater Marsh? You know it?
          Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.

                         DALE
          No. We don't.

                         MILTON
          It's important.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         MOTHER MARY
          You're in the wrong state.

                         DALE
          Mary!

                         MILTON
          And what state Should I be in?
          Dale turns, glares at Milton.

                         DALE
          Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
          It's a two day drive from here.

                         MILTON
          And Wolf Deer Run?

                         DALE
          Never heard of it.
          The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
          that's where The Smiling Man takes
          the wicked children to see the
          Mother of all things.
          Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.

                         MILTON
          Mother of all things, that sounds
          very interesting.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Oh it is! The Mother of all things
          bleeds black tears unto those who

                         CUT HER--
          Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.

                         MOTHER MARY
          It's nothing. Just a story parents
          tell to their children. Like the
          boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
          A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
          leans in with three kiddie cups.

                         PIPER
          And three milks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         MOTHER MARY
          But we didn't order--

                         PIPER
          (whispers) --On the house.
          She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
          doesn't notice...

                         MILTON
          staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
          Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So, aren't you gonna ask what time
          my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
          I'm always a little ârandy' during
          full moon.

                         MILTON
          Full moon's three days off.

                         NORMAJEAN
          (she touches his hand)
          You sure âbout that, sweetie?

                         MILTON
          Pretty sure. (looks outside) Hell
          of a ride out there. Yours?

                         NORMAJEAN
          The GTO? I wish.

                         MILTON
          (glances at Piper)
          Hers?

                         NORMAJEAN
          Sure but if you're lookin' for a
          ride...

                         MILTON
          And would you be gentle?

                         NORMAJEAN
          Life's too short for that, sweetie.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - KITCHEN - DAY

          Piper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops
          them into a soapy sink. She turns right into --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         FAT LOU
          He glares down at her.

                         PIPER
          Jesus Lou, back the fuck off.

                         FAT LOU
          âOn the houseâ? On the fucking
          house?

                         PIPER
          Oh relax. We gotta toss them
          muffins out today anyway.
          She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.

          INT. HIGHWAY 50 - FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          As Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind,
          spins her around.

                         PIPER
          Get your hand off of me!
          His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.

                         FAT LOU
          You get over there and you charge
          them for those muff...
          Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
          fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
          hear the CRUNCH.
          Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
          forehead into the bridge of his nose!

          KER-RACK!

                         PIPER
          I told you, you fat fuck son of a
          bitch, never to touch me again!
          His nose seeps blood.

                         FAT LOU
          Let...go...of...my...
          She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         PIPER
          Shut up.
          She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
          nuts. He has no choice but follow.
          She pulls him up to the American Indian family.

                         PIPER
          Tell'em.

                         FAT LOU
          Wha...what?
          We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
          wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.

                         PIPER
          Tell them...the muffins...are on
          the house.

                         FAT LOU
          On. The. House.
          She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
          floor as Piper turns to the family.
          The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.

                         PIPER
          I'm sorry your kids had to see
          that. Put some honey butter on
          those bran muffins and they taste
          an awful lot better.
          Piper turns and crosses toward the door.
          NormaJean is pale as she watches her go.
          Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but
          Milton is gone.

          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          We're close on a car door as it SLAMS.
          CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with
          life. An âI brake for pussyâ bumper sticker stands out.
          THE BACK GLASS vibrates as MUSIC blares from within.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear
          shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

          With Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway...
          ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag
          thrown over his shoulder.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper SINGS. She's empowered. Then...

          KA-THUNK.
          She grips the wheel.
          The RPMS drop.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

          The GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath
          the hood.
          CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS.
          Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours
          her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack
          shit about engines.
          FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready.
          Milton appears through the smoke.

                         MILTON
          Car trouble?
          Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing.
          Milton glances at the engine.

                         MILTON
          Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix
          that for you if you like.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         PIPER
          I would. Thank you.

                         MILTON
          If you give me a lift.

                         PIPER
          I'm only going as far as Blackfoot
          Falls. The truckstop there.

                         MILTON
          And I'd be much obliged.
          Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the
          hood shut with a smile.

                         MILTON
          Shall we?

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in
          the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper.
          Suddenly Piper turns on him.

                         PIPER
          Get it straight old man. I ain't
          sleeping with you.
          Milton chuckles.

                         MILTON
          Darlin, my days of bedding a gal ten
          minutes after I meet her are over.

                         PIPER
          Yeah. Well, that's good to hear.

                         MILTON

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          For now, anyway.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY

          Several big rigs are parked near the truck stop. A few
          derelict vehicles outside the adjacent run down old motel.
          Piper's GTO pulls in and parks near the road.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Piper climbs out. Milton rises stiffly and crosses toward
          her as he tosses the duffle over his shoulder. He offers his
          hand, gives her a smile.

                         MILTON
          âPreciate the ride, ma'am.
          Milton crosses toward an old Superman style phone booth.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY

          Piper inserts her key, glances back at Milton.
          He's in the booth now, his back to her.
          Piper turns the key and opens the door.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY

          First thing we see is MONA'S naked ass and back. Long red
          hair, she is riding a naked FRANK. Neither realizes Piper
          has opened the door.

                         MONA
          Oh Frank, you know how long I've
          wanted to feel you inside me?

                         FRANK
          Faster.

                         MONA
          Oh, you want it faster?
          Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster.
          Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and
          yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper
          drags Mona backwards off the bed.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY

          Piper drags Mona, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the lot, then
          drops her and whirls toward the room--
          -- where Frank struggles, desperate to find his pants.

                         MONA
          What's the matter with you?! You
          psycho bitch from...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.
          Piper spins on Mona, points a finger in warning.

                         PIPER
          Don't.
          It shuts Mona up.
          Piper storms back toward the room.

                         HER POV
          Frank hops with one leg in his jeans. He sees her coming.
          Although he's a big fella, he looks scared.
          Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across
          the face!

                         MONA
          Fuck you, Piper, we're in lo--

          WHAM!
          Piper clocks Mona!
          Mona stands there...dazed. Swaying. Confused.

                         PIPER
          What was that? I didn't catch that
          last word.

                         MONA
          Oh...I...I said...we're in lo--

          WHAM!
          This time Mona stumbles backwards and CRASHES into a metal
          chair on the motel porch.
          Piper brushes passed her.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY

          Piper stuffs a gym bag with clothes.

                         FRANK
          Now baby, just hold on.

                         PIPER
          I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come
          near me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         FRANK
          Look, sooner you accept this is
          your fault, the better.
          Piper stops, turns, stares.

                         FRANK
          Baby, I can't just turn it off.
          Now you know that. I gotta have
          it. At least once a day. It's in
          the wiring. You did this. You
          made me cheat on you. You're lucky
          I'm not more pissed about it.
          Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker
          punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door.

                         FRANK
          Piper! Now cut it out. Enough
          with the drama!

          INT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S MOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

          Milton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear
          is a fake out.
          Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around.

                         HIS POV

          THE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70
          ...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at
          Milton, cell phone to his ear. He sees Milton see him,
          quickly backs into the shadows.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          Piper!

          EXT. LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY

          Piper exits, glances at Mona, sprawled out unconscious in the
          metal chair, an ASIAN MAN in a Hawaiian shirt SNAPS pictures
          of her.
          Piper snatches the camera and flings it against the wall
          where it SHATTERS.

                         ASIAN MAN
          Hey?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         PIPER
          Pervert.
          Piper stomps across the lot as Frank exits, calls to her.

                         FRANK
          Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we
          talk about this?
          Piper keeps walking. Never looks back.

                         FRANK
          Piper, stop this! You got nowhere
          to go and you know it.

                         PIPER
          I'll go to San Francisco and stay
          with my cousin.

                         FRANK
          (Realization) Whoa. You ain't
          taking my car.
          Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger.

                         FRANK
          I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch.
          Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and --

          WHAM!
          -- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank
          stumbles, nearly goes down.

                         PIPER
          Your car?! Who's been making the
          payments you out of work, skanky
          Mona fucking piece of shit?!
          She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS
          and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation.
          Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM!

                         FRANK
          Stop...

          WHAM!

                         FRANK
          ...hitting me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          She swings but this time Frank lashes out.

          KUH-RACK!
          He punches her in the face. Hard. She drops to her hands
          and knees. When she looks up, her teeth are caked in blood.

                         FRANK
          You're insane, you know that? Look
          what you made me do!
          She staggers to her feet, sways before him.

                         FRANK
          Come on, I'll get you some ice--
          She SPITS blood in his face and SWINGS!
          He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with the force of
          thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful
          she'll get up this time, then --

                         QUIET LAUGHTER
          Frank stares as Piper rolls over.

                         PIPER
          Frank. Sweetie. I'm gonna tell
          everybody what I caught you doing
          with my pink dildo.
          Her laughter becomes a hysterical fit.

                         FRANK
          That's it.
          He drops on top of her, his fingers curl into a fist.

                         FRANK
          You don't wanna fuck me? Fine.
          When I'm done nobody's gonna wanna
          fuck you. Ever.

                         PIPER
          Go to hell.
          Frank raises his fist into the air. Then...

          MILTON (O.S.)
          Hey.
          Frank looks up as a boot catches him under the chin, lifting
          him off Piper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          Piper stares through blurry eyes as Milton drops on top of
          Frank, pounding him with his fists.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:

          EXT. COLORADO PLAINS - DUSK

          The sun is a glow to the west. The horizon dances and
          shimmers. Then...is that...yes. Someone is out there.
          Walking toward us. As if they appeared within the heat.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          We start close to the ground. Dress shoes. Suit pants.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          The ACCOUNTANT. Least he sure as shit looks like an
          accountant in blue suit and purple power tie. Not especially
          large. Nice looking face. Something trustworthy about him.
          Friendly even.
          He loosens his tie, slips his jacket off and tosses it over
          his shoulder. There's a bounce in his step.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DUSK

          NormaJean looks up as the Accountant enters.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Have a seat sweetie. Mary there
          will be right with you.
          Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper's replacement. She stops in
          her tracks. Stares at the Accountant.
          He winks at her.
          A shiver runs through Mother Mary. She backs away then
          rushes from the diner.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Mary?!
          Fat Lou leans from the Kitchen window.

                         FAT LOU
          Where's she going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          The Accountant turns to Lou. Stares. Then --

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You. Fat fuck. Come here.
          Lou stares.

                         FAT LOU
          What did you call me?
          The Accountant smiles.
          Fat Lou vanishes from the window then BURSTS from the kitchen.

                         FAT LOU
          I said, what did you call--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --I called you âfat fuck' and we had
          better leave it at that unless you'd
          prefer I call you âdead fat fuck.'

                         FAT LOU
          Wha-what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. An old
          man. White hair. Five-eleven.
          The Accountant smells the air, embraces it.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He was here earlier. Traveling
          light. Likely on foot.

                         FAT LOU
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FAT LOU
          That's supposed to mean something
          to me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It will if I add you to the books.
          And if you don't tell me what I
          want to know...
          NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          The Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a
          step back.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You had something to say?

                         NORMAJEAN
          He was here. Earlier.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Yes. We've established that.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Terrible tipper.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm sure he was. Where did he go?
          She points.

                         NORMAJEAN
          That way. West. On foot.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT

          The GTO THUNDERS past.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Piper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat.
          She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly
          Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow,
          looks at the jacket covering her.
          Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky.
          Piper looks.
          The MOON hangs a few days from full.
          Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her,
          then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold.

                         MILTON
          Want me to roll the window up?

                         PIPER
          You didn't kill him did you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         MILTON
          No but he'll likely piss blood for
          a day or two.

                         PIPER
          Thanks for that.

                         MILTON
          Hungry?
          He gestures through the windshield as they pass a âWelcome to
          Utahâ sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead.

                         PIPER
          Utah?

                         MILTON
          You mentioned San Francisco.

                         PIPER
          Appreciate what you done for me
          back there but I ain't takin you
          all the way to--

                         MILTON
          --My business is in Nevada. Can
          you get me that far?

                         PIPER
          What business?

                         MILTON
          I'm looking for someone. You
          hungry or not?
          Piper considers for a moment, then--

                         PIPER
          Yeah. I could eat.

                         MILTON
          Name's Milton. You're Piper,
          right?

                         PIPER
          You try to kill me and dump me in
          the desert I'll cut your nuts off.

                         MILTON
          Fair enough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

          Pool tables, old pin ball machines and an odd mix of BIKERS,
          COWBOYS and the SLUTS who love them.
          Piper and Milton slide into a booth. Piper eyes a Latino
          BUSBOY, nice biceps, jeans too tight.
          ROY, a greasy fella in his fifties approaches, big happy
          looking fucker, owns the joint.

                         GREASY FELLA
          Greetings folks, welcome to the
          Bull by the Balls...
          He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape.

                         MILTON
          Roy.

                         ROY
          Milton?
          Roy doesn't even try to hide his dislike of Milton.

                         ROY
          Thought you were dead.

                         MILTON
          You hoped I was dead. Not the same.

                         ROY
          You planning on staying?
          Milton eyes a door marked âMotel Guestsâ.

                         MILTON
          Got a problem with that?

                         ROY
          Your money's good as any Iâspect.
          But be gone by dawn.
          With Roy turns his back on them and walks away.

                         PIPER
          What was that all about?

                         MILTON
          Back in another life I used to
          drive a truck through these parts.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         PIPER
          And you'd spend the night here?

                         MILTON
          I'd spend the night here fucking
          his wife.
          Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar.

                         PIPER
          What's wrong?

                         MILTON
          I...nothing I guess.
          A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her
          fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton.

                         CANDY
          Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you
          off with some drinks?

                         MILTON
          Beer.

                         PIPER
          Same.
          Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table.

                         CANDY
          And I'll need to see your IDs.
          Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins
          filling out the card.

                         MILTON
          What is this?

                         PIPER
          Guess it's been awhile since you
          drove that truck through here.

                         CANDY
          You want a drink? You gotta be a
          member. Dry county.

                         MILTON
          You're kidding.

                         CANDY
          Welcome to Utah, Mr...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          She takes his license.

                         MILTON
          Call me Milton.

                         CANDY
          This license isn't just expired.
          It's an antique.

                         MILTON
          Fine, then bring me a milk.
          She tosses his card on the table.

                         CANDY
          For you, gorgeous, we'll break the
          rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody.
          Milton watches her go. Drinking her up.

                         PIPER
          You gonna tap that?

                         MILTON
          Tap what?

                         PIPER
          Jeez, Milton, how long's it been?
          Sounds like you used to stick it in
          anything with a crack.

                         MILTON
          Yeah. Well. I've been distracted.

                         PIPER
          Suit yourself. But nobody reaches
          the end and says, âWish I hadn't
          fucked so much.â
          Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he
          needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles.
          Piper slides from the booth.

                         MILTON
          Where are you...?

                         PIPER
          I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot
          bath and sleep in a warm bed.

                         MILTON
          What about your beer?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         PIPER
          You drink it. See you at dawn.
          But she walks right passed the âMotel Guestsâ door and
          approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her.
          As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back
          of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good
          looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden
          beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye
          but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
          He glances at Milton then --

                         JONAH KING
          It's Roy isn't it?
          Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile.

                         ROY
          Sure is. Get you a drink friend?

                         JONAH KING
          Fantastic place you have here. You
          don't happen to rent it out for
          parties do you?

                         ROY
          We sure do. You planing a party?
          Again Jonah glances at Milton.

                         JONAH KING
          Oh yes. Tonight, in fact.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - NIGHT

          The Television chatters away with local nightly news. Frank
          ignores it, paces on the phone. As he does, we see Jonah
          King's face on the TV. The same guy from the bar. Archive
          footage of him preaching, warm, friendly.

                          FRANK
          I gotta go.
          Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find --
          The Accountant smiling at him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          There was an old man, yes?

                         FRANK
          Wha?
          The Accountant sniffs the air.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          White hair. Angry with attitude.

                         FRANK
          Sumbitch kicked me in the face.
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FRANK
          The wha? I called the cops, not a
          bean-counter?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          The old man? Where did he go?

                         FRANK
          Fuck should I know where he went?
          I woke up and all three were gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          All three?

                         FRANK
          The bitch, the old man and my car!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          You know what, fuck you. You ain't
          no cop. I'm done talking.
          Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant grabs his
          wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room!
          Frank doesn't stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the
          ground his toes drag the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite
          wall and bounces into the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You son of a --
          Frank staggers to his feet. Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He
          wipes blood onto the back of his hand.

                         FRANK
          You...you made me bleed.
          Frank pulls a baseball bat from behind the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You leave me no choice but to beat
          you with this Louisville Slugger.
          Frank takes a step, swings at the Accountant.
          The Accountant dodges.
          Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS & GLASS fly.
          The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.
          SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him
          backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs
          there until...
          The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather
          momentum.
          Frank can only watch as the Accountant -

          HURLS THE JAGGED TIP OF THE BAT RIGHT AT HIM --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          The tip STRIKES Frank in the shoulder with such force, it
          impales him up to the knob. Drives him backwards where it
          embeds into the wall!
          The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses
          it from hand to hand with a loud SLAP of flesh on wood.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          (dazed) I...what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Your car. What kind is it?
          Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.

                         FRANK
          Wha...what did you do?
          The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS
          out in pain.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Answer the question.

                         FRANK
          A â67 GTO! Arrgg!
          The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye
          a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.

                         FRANK
          Hey! Just hold on!
          The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.

          FRANK'S POV
          It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists
          his head...no good.
          The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS
          his head to the wall. The words Louisville Slugger just
          visible where Frank's face should be.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - NIGHT

          The Accountant exits as two STATE TROOPERS approach, their
          vehicle parked behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         TROOPER #1
          Frank Raimi?

                         TROOPER #2
          You called about a stolen car?
          The Accountant gestures over his shoulder.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In there.
          Trooper #1 moves toward the opened door. The Accountant
          steps in front of Trooper #2.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. Five-
          eleven. White hair. Driving a â67
          GTO. He's traveling with her.
          He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo.

                         TROOPER #2
          Excuse me?
          The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being
          worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the
          coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at
          it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it.
          Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room.

                         TROOPER #1
          Jesus.
          He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant.

                         TROOPER #1
          Keep your hands where I can see them!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers, this is your lucky day.
          Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin.
          ANGLE - High looking down on the trio as the coin spins right
          in front of us - we glimpse the ancient face in the worn
          silver - Roman maybe?

                         TROOPER #1
          Show us your hands, asshole.
          (to his partner)
          What's the matter with you?! Draw
          your weapon!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          Trooper #2 slowly reaches for his gun until...
          The Accountant snatches the coin from the sky, thrusts it at
          the two cops.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Here. Look at this.
          They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it.

                         TROOPER #1
          You're... you're a Fed?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In pursuit of a white haired man. John
          Milton. He's travelling with the girl
          in this picture.
          Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in
          his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon.

                         TROOPER #1
          But, that guy, in the room. He's -

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --Dead. Yes. I'd say it's
          unfortunate, but I'd be lying.
          World won't miss him. Look,
          troopers. I need your help with my
          pursuit of this fugitive. If we,
          we three, can apprehend him...you
          are ambitious, correct.

                         TROOPER #2
          I guess...

                         TROOPER #1
          Yes, we are...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Wasn't actually a question. I can
          tell you are. Success will mean
          promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee
          it. Now we are going to hunt this
          Milton, we are going to find the
          GTO he's driving and when we find
          him, you will shoot to kill. You
          understand? Shoot. To. Kill.
          The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive.
          Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         TROOPER #1
          That's against protocol...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          This man is highly dangerous. He
          has killed and will kill again. He
          must be taken down on sight. The
          time it takes you to follow your
          protocols is the time it takes him
          to end your life.
          The Accountant crosses to the cruiser's back door, the coin
          disappearing back into his pocket.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Shall we?

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - NIGHT

          We're staring into two motel rooms. We're cheating...the
          wall that divides the rooms...divides the screen. The beds
          in each room butted up against the dividing wall.
          On one side we see Piper, on her back. Still clothed. At
          her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy.
          He's painting her toenails.
          On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding
          him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER.
          The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then...

                         BUSBOY
          Uh, are we gonna do it?

                         PIPER
          Well, I don't know, baby. Depends
          on how well you do those nails.
          Now pay attention. You might need
          to redo that one.
          He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her
          hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are
          starting to annoy the fuck out of her.
          She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall.

                         PIPER
          Shut the fuck up in there!
          Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         MILTON
          You shut the fuck up!
          That's it!
          Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared
          and topples backwards to the floor.

                         PIPER
          (giggles) Oh! Sorry, I didn't
          mean...
          She stops. Stares.
          Movement. Someone stepped quickly away from the window.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

          Piper BURSTS into the room ready to kick ass and take names.
          But...the place is...empty. Food still on the plates. Beer
          in the mugs. The TV over the bar is still on.
          We see footage of a Nevada Amber Alert. âBaby Tabitha still
          missingâ A photo of a baby in pink onesie. Then appearing
          beside it...the photo of Jonah King.

                         TV NEWS
          ...issued an all points bulletin for
          Jonah King's immediate detention in
          connection with the murder of a young
          married couple in Loveland, Colorado.
          Their infant girl is believed to have
          been abducted by this religious sect.
          A nation-wide Amber Alert is now in
          full effect.
          Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the bar.
          What the fuck?
          She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of athletic
          equipment hangs from the wall.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACKLOT - NIGHT

          Piper exits with a hockey stick.
          A few cars are left in the lot. A black Chevy van with flames
          stands out, parked in front of a barn/storage building.
          Piper crosses to a window in the bar/motel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         THROUGH WINDOW
          Busboy sits on Piper's bed. Still naked. He holds her nail
          polish to his nose. Sniffs. Jerks his head back.

                         PIPER
          Imbecile.

                         A NOISE
          Piper spins, grips the hockey stick.
          No one. The cars are empty. The barn looks undistur...
          A light GLOWS within the barn, bleeding through the wood
          slats. Then...
          CRREEEEEEEK...barn door slowly swings open.
          ...revealing THREE SILHOUETTES backlit by a hanging lamp.
          One holds a shovel. The other heaves an ax over his
          shoulder. The third holds a shotgun.
          The side door on the flamed van slides open. TWO SILHOUETTES
          step out. Baseball bat and machete.

                         FOOTSTEPS
          Piper spins as THREE DARK FIGURES appear around the side of
          the bar/motel. Sledge hammer, iron pipe, sickle.
          Surrounded. All seven begin walking toward her.
          Piper rushes back inside.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - NIGHT

          Still empty. Piper turns toward the door marked âMotel
          Guestsâ then hesitates.
          Instead she dives under a booth table...as...
          The back door opens.

          PIPER'S POV
          LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers. Work boots. Cowboy
          boots with a duct tape patch.
          A door opens. Piper sucks in breath. More legs appear.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          Shadows approach the desk counter near the âMotel Guestsâ
          door. There's an open guest book on the counter top.

          CLOSE ON GUEST BOOK
          As a weathered hand comes into view. A finger traces down to
          the last two entries.
          Piper Lee RM 111
          John Milton RM 112

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - MILTON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Candy's still on top. She is, as we say in the fuck
          industry, âcloseâ.

                         CANDY
          Close'm'close'm'close'm'close.
          Suddenly Milton's head jerks toward the door.
          His hand shoots beneath his pillow as--
          The door BURSTS OPEN!
          MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room.
          Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!

          KAFOOM!
          IRON PIPE is BLOWN backwards into MAN WITH MACHETE!
          Milton thrusts upright, suddenly Candy finds herself beneath
          him as --
          Machete HEAVES Iron Pipe to the side and rushes toward Milton
          as -- KAFOOM! He's blown off his feet!

          KER-SMASH!
          The window shatters as a MAN WITH BASEBALL BAT dives, hits,
          rolls and comes up swinging!
          Milton snakes an arm beneath Candy and rolls from the bed
          with her! As they fall--
          The bat SLAMS onto the mattress just missing them as --

          KA-BOOM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Milton turns Baseball Bat's head into a canoe!
          Milton on bottom again as they crash to the floor, still
          intertwined.

          FWOOM!
          The door adjoining Milton and Piper's room EXPLODES open at
          his feet!
          MAN WITH AXE and MAN WITH SHOTGUN enter!
          Milton, presses Candy's face into his chest, twisting his
          body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice!
          Shotgun's eye vaporizes in a mist! He drops to his knees.
          Man with Axe clutches his throat...blood gushing...turns and
          flees back into the adjoining room as --

          KUH-FWAM!
          The bathroom door flies open!

          MILTON'S POV
          Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots with duct tape patch
          appears.
          Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls
          Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor.
          COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see
          Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed.

          COWBOY WITH SLEDGE
          Old Man. You know you can't stop
          what's comin' That little girl's
          as good as dead.
          TWO BULLETS slide into the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut.
          Milton aims under the bed. FIRES!
          Half the man's foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes
          to the floor!
          He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond
          before Sledge Hammer's forehead implodes.

                         A NOISE
          Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just
          in time to see--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          MAN WITH SICKLE enter!
          He stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at Milton.
          The glare becomes fear.
          Milton's already aiming the 357, then --

          CLICK. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK
          Sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and--

          KUR-RUNCH!
          The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a hockey stick crashes
          down from above and behind.
          Sickle drops to the floor revealing Piper, white knuckling
          the hockey stick...her face pale.

                         MILTON
          Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad.
          Milton stares down into Candy's face.
          Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and
          opens her eyes.

                         CANDY
          Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck
          I've ever had.
          Piper crosses to the adjoining room.

                         CANDY
          Hello? Do you mind?! We're...
          Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She
          SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room.

          PIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM
          Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But
          it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood
          drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming.

                         PIPER
          Aw, hell.
          Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with
          Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357.

                         MILTON
          I definitely got their attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         PIPER
          What. The fuck? You know these people?
          Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder.

                         MILTON
          Come on. There are probably more.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - FRONT - NIGHT

          Jonah King slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked
          Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses
          toward the Driver's side door...
          The gym bag starts to CRY.

                         JONAH KING
          Shhhh. Don't cry little precious.
          FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut.
          Jonah King turns, freezes.
          Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser,
          staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag.
          For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career
          maker. News. Media. Leno. Then--
          The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He
          ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers. Remember why we're here.
          He walks by them towards the front door of the bar.
          Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building.
          Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at
          the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the
          gym bag, engine ROARS to life.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACK LOT - NIGHT

          Milton and Piper exit into the back lot.

                         PIPER
          Milton, I'm serious! I want some
          answers!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          They turn as the SPEEDING Sedan tears onto the highway. As
          it disappears behind the barn it reveals --
          --Man With Shovel. He FLINGS the barn doors open, stares at
          Milton and Piper for a moment then vanishes within.

                         MILTON
          Yeah, we both want some answers.
          Milton moves toward the barn as--
          The State Troopers walk around the bar.
          Everyone freezes.
          The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper.
          Recognition.

                         MILTON
          Aw fuck.
          Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the
          Troopers as they go for their guns.

                         MILTON
          Come on!
          Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire!
          The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and
          shoot back!

          FFFUMP!
          Milton staggers, clutches his side. A crimson spot spreads
          across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles,
          falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes
          spilling from within.

                         PIPER
          No!
          The Troopers keep FIRING!
          Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun
          lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter.
          We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any
          old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the
          metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry.
          She reaches for it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         MILTON
          No! Not that one.
          He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without
          hesitation, rises and --

          KUPOW!
          Trooper #1's chest EXPLODES. The force spins him...still
          firing...he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear!
          Both men crash to the ground. Dead.

          KAFOOM!
          The barn doors explode outward as a big Dodge truck powers
          toward the highway, Man with Shovel behind the wheel.
          Piper turns to find Milton struggling toward the GTO.

                         PIPER
          What are you doing?!

                         MILTON
          Have to stop him...

                         PIPER
          Milton! Those cops weren't trying
          to arrest us!

                         MILTON
          No. They weren't. Get in.
          Milton climbs behind the GTO's wheel.

                         PIPER
          I'll drive.

                         MILTON
          You gotta patch me up. I'll drive.
          Piper fumes but climbs into the passengers seat.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          The car RUMBLES to life!

                         PIPER
          They were trying to kill us!

                         MILTON
          Yes.

                         PIPER
          They were trying to kill you.

                         MILTON
          Yes.
          Milton floors it! As the GTO fishtails toward the highway--

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The Accountant steps from the back door of the bar.
          Hunter and Hunted glare.

                         MILTON
          Christ.
          Piper's attention is still on the dead cops.

                         PIPER
          Christ is right! They start
          shooting with no warning?! What
          are you, a murderer? You escape
          from prison or something?
          The GTO tears onto the highway!

          IN REARVIEW MIRROR
          The Accountant just stands there...fading into the darkness.

                         PIPER
          Well?! Which is it?!

                         MILTON
          Both.
          Piper raises the gun, points it at Milton.

                         PIPER
          What have you gotten me into? I
          should...I should...Jesus, I just
          killed a cop! I'm going to prison.
          Give me one good reason I shouldn't
          shoot you in the face.

                         MILTON
          Because I'm driving.

                         PIPER
          You know what I mean!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Milton gestures through the windshield, toward the distant
          brake lights ahead.

                         MILTON
          They took my grand-baby. Took my
          grand-baby and killed my...
          He breaks off. Looks away.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          We see the lighted Amber Alert sign come into view and
          quickly blur passed.
          Piper stares at Milton.

                         PIPER
          The little girl on the news? The
          baby girl they're looking for?
          Milton nods.

                         PIPER
          But the news said the baby's
          parents were...
          Piper stops.
          Milton's eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.

                         MILTON
          Sons of bitches killed my daughter.
          Piper stares. Milton steadies himself.

                         MILTON
          So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm
          gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm
          gonna get her back and I'm gonna
          kill every last one of the fuckers.

                         (A BEAT)
          You want out, I'll understand.
          Piper considers, then --

          KUH-FWAM!
          They both slam into their seats as the GTO is rear-ended.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          EXT. GTO - NIGHT

          It's the Trooper's cruiser. The Accountant, face blank, sits
          behind the wheel.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He
          mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin!

                         MILTON
          In the back seat. Now.

                         PIPER
          What? Why?

                         MILTON
          Now!
          Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the
          cruiser pull up along side him.

                         MILTON
          Shotgun. It's already loaded.
          Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the
          front seat.

                         MILTON
          Have the other one ready. Not the
          357. The OLD one.

          THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW
          The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a
          beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton.
          Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel
          through the passenger window.

          BOOOM!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The cruiser's driver's side window explodes.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT


          MILTON'S POV

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          The Accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder.
          When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A
          cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser
          next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It's over, Milton. Stop the car.

                         MILTON
          I can't do that.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Really? What makes you think you
          have a choice?

                         MILTON
          I got something I gotta do first.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Then you should have done it a long
          time ago.

                         MILTON
          I didn't have to do it a long time ago!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Milton, I will kill that nice woman
          in the backseat to get to you.

                         MILTON
          I won't let you do that.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Again. What makes you think you
          have a choice?

                         MILTON

                         (TO PIPER)
          Now.
          Piper hands Milton the ancient Six Shooter. Milton snatches
          it, points it across the gap between cars, pulls back the
          hammer with a thunderous...KUH-THUNK.

                         MILTON
          This does.
          The Accountant's eyes widen.

          SSHHU-BOOOM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          It's as if God tripped, fell and the entire earth shook as a
          result!
          The recoil nearly rips Milton's arm off.
          We travel with the slug, fire trailing it, as it SLOMOs
          toward the Accountant...his eyes continuing to widen...the
          muscles in his face contracting.

          INT. CRUISER - NIGHT

          The Accountant cuts the wheel. Hard.
          He wracks his head around as the slug just kisses his cheek.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The Cruiser SLAMS into the guard rail! The back-end rockets
          forward as the cruiser goes into a spin.
          The GTO fishtails away.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton fights with the wheel as --

          IN REARVIEW MIRROR
          The Cruiser bucks up and over the guard rail.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The Cruiser, spins like a top, helicopters out over the
          nothingness and plummets to the dry valley below.

          KER-FRUNCH!
          And flattens sending out a dusty shockwave in all directions.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton manages to stop the GTO before it slams into the rail.
          The GTO BUCKS and STALLS.
          He breathes a sigh, then turns and stares in the direction
          they'd been going.
          He can just make out the fleeing Cultist's tail lights.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          The back door opens. Piper leaps out.

                         MILTON
          Piper! Wait!
          Milton watches the taillights vanish over a distant ridge.
          He starts the engine...then hesitates...

          THROUGH BACK WINDOW
          Piper approaches the destroyed guard rail.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          Piper stares into the valley below.

                         HER POV
          We can just make out the flattened Cruiser in the light of
          the three quarter moon. No fireball. No smoke. No sign of
          movement. Just flattened metal.

                         PIPER
          He's not one of the ones who took
          your granddaughter, is he?

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          Milton stands behind her. Shakes his head.

                         MILTON
          Someone else.

                         PIPER
          Is there anyone not trying to kill you?
          Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then --

                         PIPER
          Come on. I'll help you. But
          we're dealing with that first?
          She points to his blood soaked shirt.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT

          The GTO THUNDERS beneath a starry sky.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER
          The needle hovers at 95 mph.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach
          wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads.

                         MILTON
          My daughter got mixed up with the son
          of a bitch right out of college.

                         PIPER
          She knew him? She knew Jonah King,
          the man they think killed...
          She stops herself.

                         MILTON
          She knew him. The world was in a
          fuckin tailspin and King was
          preaching quiet revolution.
          He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357.

                         MILTON
          It was four months before she
          realized âquiet' meant hiding in
          the basement, cutting the heads off
          chickens.

                         PIPER
          Jonah King was into voodoo?
          Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically.

                         MILTON
          Voodoo, the occult, not much he
          wasn't into. When she told him she
          was leaving, he helped her pack.
          Gassed up her car. Cooked her a
          hot meal. Then while she slept he
          broke her leg in three places with
          a tire iron.

                         PIPER
          Jesus.
          She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         MILTON
          She learned her lessen. Was a good
          little follower for eighteen
          months. That's when they met with
          some witch doctor bullshit artist
          in Chinatown. It was Chinese New
          Year so the place was wall to wall
          slants. She saw her chance,
          stabbed Jonah in the face with a
          souvenir corkscrew and vanished
          into the crowd.

                         PIPER
          Milton. Your daughter was in a
          cult for two years and you didn't
          know? Why didn't you help her?
          Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight.
          His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The
          gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber.

                         MILTON
          I didn't find out about any of this
          until...until I got locked up.
          Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut.
          Shoves it into his duffle.

                         PIPER
          Not gonna reload?

                         MILTON
          Only had three bullets to begin...

                         PIPER
          Milton.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an
          accident.
          Milton eases the shotgun into his lap.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Several vehicles and an RV block the road. The PASSENGERS
          scramble back and forth. There's a jack-knifed flatbed, a
          crumpled Station Wagon and the Cultist's Dodge truck is
          overturned on the shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          INT. GTO - DAWN


                         PIPER
          That's his truck.

                         MILTON
          Stay put. I won't be long.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Milton climbs from the GTO and crosses toward the overturned
          Dodge. He lets the shotgun dangle at his side, keeping it
          hidden behind him.
          TATTOOED GUY and SKANKY GAL stand near the RV with MAN IN
          LEATHER JACKET. BUSINESS WOMAN paces on her cell phone.
          Milton glances at MAN WITH WIG sitting in the driver's seat
          of his station wagon, his face in his hands. LADY IN
          LEOPARDSKIN HOTPANTS kneels beside him. In the passenger
          seat, BURLY DUDE's on his phone. Watching Milton.
          There's a couple near the overturned Dodge. TRUCK DRIVING
          WOMAN gazes into the upsidedown cab. THIN OLD MAN rises and
          nods as Milton approaches.

          THIN OLD MAN
          I think he's gonna be okay.

                         MILTON
          Is that right?
          In a swift move, Milton RATCHETS a shell into the chamber,
          drops to one knee, aims into the cab.

          MILTON'S POV
          The cab is empty.
          Somewhere near, we hear a MUFFLED BABY'S CRY.

          CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
          Realization. Shit. But it's too late.
          A snub-nosed .38 appears at his temple.

          THIN OLD MAN
          I wouldn't.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          PIPER (O.S.)
          Milton!
          Milton rises slowly and takes in the situation.
          Tattooed Guy comes up fast behind the GTO. We get a good
          look at him. It's Man with Shovel. Piper's getting out,
          doesn't see Tattooed Guy until he's grabbed her. Presses the
          pistol in her ribs.

                         PIPER
          Hey! Let me go, fucker!
          She goes to fight but Man in Leather Jacket approaches her
          with an axe. Burly Dude is with him.

                         MILTON
          Don't Piper! (to Thin Old Man)
          Let her go. She's a pain in the
          ass you don't want.
          Milton still hasn't let go of his shotgun.

          THIN OLD MAN
          Drop it. Or we'll gut her.
          To emphasize the point, Truck Driving Woman pulls a Rambo
          Knife from her purse and smiles a missing toothed smile.
          Milton drops the shotgun as --
          --Man With Wig steps from his car with a scoped hunting
          rifle. Lady in Leopardskin rises revealing a baseball bat
          with nails and spikes protruding from the end.
          Skanky Gal and Business Woman open the RV's door.
          Jonah King steps from within then smiles down at Milton. He
          cradles a baby in his arms.

                         JONAH KING
          Milton, isn't it? Why are you here?
          Why are you making such a fuss?

                         MILTON
          Isn't that obvious, you sick fuck?
          I'm here for her.
          Milton gestures toward the baby.

                         JONAH KING
          What's obvious is that you clearly
          abandoned your daughter.

          51.
          JONAH KING (cont'd)
          Crushed her so completely that she
          told everyone you were dead. No,
          Milton, I cannot in good faith hand
          over this child to you.

                         MILTON
          But sacrificing her under the full
          fuckin moon, that's okay?

                         JONAH KING
          Okay? Milton, your granddaughter is
          unbelievably blessed. Look around.
          The world's on fire. Companies own
          our governments and the people
          suffer. Daily. And will continue to
          suffer until change comes. And
          change will come. Thanks to your
          granddaughter, Milton. She will open
          the door to a new world order.

                         MILTON
          Your BS don't work on me. You
          killed my daughter but I won't let
          you kill my grandbaby.

                         JONAH KING
          Your daughter's death was an
          accident.

                         MILTON
          No shithead, it wasn't. I saw the
          whole damn thing. I saw who you
          are when no one's lookin'. And I
          saw what that night cost ya.
          Jonah's armor cracks a little as Milton faces the others.

                         JONAH KING
          Milton, you're embarrassing your--

                         MILTON
          (to the crowd)
          --What was it three or four days
          before he showed after killin my
          little girl? You jerkoffs didn't
          notice he was walking a little stiff?
          Milton glances at Skanky Gal and Business Woman.

                         MILTON
          When's the last time he shared a
          bed with either of you? Before
          that night, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          The girls shoot a nervous glance at Jonah.

                         MILTON
          You forced my daughter onto her
          knees, you sonofabitch. And she made
          you pay for it.
          Jonah stares at Milton in shock. How does he know?

                         MILTON
          But don't take my word for it. Ask
          him. Leather Jacket was there.
          Jonah made him swear not to tell.
          Jonah lifts a .38 auto from within the baby's blanket and
          shoots Leather Jacket in the forehead.
          Piper SCREAMS. The Baby starts CRYING.
          Jonah shoves the baby into Skanky Gal's arms then swings the
          gun toward Milton.

                         JONAH KING
          Put the blonde in the RV.
          Tattooed Guy shoves Piper toward the RV as Skanky and
          Business woman climb in with the baby.
          Jonah aims the gun at Milton's face.

                         MILTON
          I'm only gonna make this offer
          once. Give me my granddaughter and
          I'll let you liv--

          KAPOW!
          He shoots Milton in the left eye! Milton's head snaps, he
          falls to the ground on his back.

                         PIPER
          No!!!
          Tattooed Guy shoves Piper into the RV.

          INT. RV - DAWN

          Skanky tries to calm the crying baby. Tattoo shoves Piper
          onto the travel couch then hands the gun to Business Woman.

                         BUSINESS WOMAN
          Please. Try something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          Jonah climbs into the RV, closes the door.

                         JONAH KING
          Let's go.

                         PIPER
          You killed him! You bastard you --

          WHACK!
          Piper's head rocks back as Business Woman pistol whips her.

                         BUSINESS WOMAN
          Next time I shoot that mouth right
          off your face.
          Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper's SOBS
          rising behind him.

          JONAH'S POV
          Milton's body lays there. Unmoving. His one eye staring
          skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the
          cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Man With Wig pops the back of the Station wagon. Truck
          Driving Woman and Thin Old Man lean in, snatch two shovels.
          Burly Dude drags Leather Jacket's body next to Milton's as
          the others join him.
          They gaze down at Milton, his one eye open and unseeing. A
          single tear runs from it. The other, pools blood where the
          bullet entered.

          MILTON'S GOOD EYE TWITCHES.
          Everyone stares. Did they just see that right?

          THE 357 COMES UP IN MILTON'S HAND - FIRES!
          The bullet RIPS BURLY'S SCALP WIDE. He stumbles back.
          The others recoil.
          Burly ROARS, blood streaming from his head wound - charges
          Milton with the ax.
          MILTON unleashes rapid fire lead from the 357!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Burly's blown back! The others scatter as Milton staggers to
          his feet! He grabs the shotgun, leans on it for support.

                         ON GTO
          AS Milton stumbles to the open passenger door.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of the Station Wagon with
          the scoped hunting rifle. Aims.
          BLAM - His shot rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off.
          Milton FIRES back with the shotgun - forcing Man with Wig
          back behind the wagon.

          INT. GTO - DAWN

          Milton falls heavily across the front seats. Ties Piper's
          bandanna around his head, covers his now gaping eye.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE

          Man with Wig hasn't had enough yet. He aims the rifle.
          Moves into the road. Can't see Milton in the car, but that
          doesn't matter. He knows he's there.

          BLAM.

          INT. GTO - DAWN

          The windshield SHATTERS. Glass splinters down on Milton. He
          reaches for the keys.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          The Cultists jump at the sound of the GTO's GLASS PACKS!
          Dust rips skyward as the GTO barrels toward them!
          They scramble, clawing at one another to get out of the way.
          All except Man With Wig. He's playin' hero, lines Milton in
          his sights. But what he sees shakes him to his core.

          POV THRU SCOPE
          MILTON, face bloody and twisted with rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Man with Wig screams, falls, tries to roll out of the way.

          FU-FUMP!
          The wheels pound over both of his legs, SHATTERING them!

          INT. GTO - DRIVING - DAY

          Milton flips open the 357 as he FISHTAILS the GTO back onto
          the highway. He dangles the 357 out the window.

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          Empty shells DANCE onto the blacktop, several SKITTER down
          onto the cracked Earth and OS.
          ANGLE - moving fast, the GTO's wheels consume the frame.

                         MATCHING TO:
          A bicycle tire SKIDS to a stop before us. Then a second.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          EXT. VALLEY FLOOR - DAY

          Two TEENAGERS sit on beat-to-shit mountain bikes, staring.

                         THEIR POV
          The cratered cruiser lies on its crushed roof, both doors
          shut. No windows visible.
          TEEN #1 lights a chillum pipe, inhales. Holds it, passes the
          pipe, then speaks as only a pothead can.

                         TEEN #1
          Think anyone's in there?

                         TEEN #2
          (inhales, holds, passes)
          I guess. Doors is still closed.

                         TEEN #1
          (inhales, holds)
          Bet it's sick. Wanna look?

          KWU-FOOM!
          The driver's side door launches right at us!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          ...nails Teen #2 in the chest, knocking him ten feet
          backwards where he skids on his back.

                         TEEN #1
          Jesus!
          The Accountant rolls from the cruiser, stands, brushes
          himself off as he strides forward.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Carpenter and despite what you've
          heard, prefers short hair.
          Teen #2 sits up suddenly, coughing.

                         TEEN #2
          You...you nearly killed me!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Not even close. I won't see you
          again until...
          He tilts his head, as if reading a sign too far away.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          ...until you're seventy-three.
          He glances at Teen #1, then --

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You, I'll see in three months.
          And with that the Accountant turns and strides away.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - MOVING - DAY

          The RV RUMBLES past, running faster than an RV should.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah glances through the back window. Double takes.

                         HIS POV
          A rapidly growing black blotch on the road. In seconds that
          blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway,
          gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When
          Jonah speaks...it is with wonder.

                         JONAH KING
          Look at this. He's still coming.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         TATTOO
          Who's still coming?

                         JONAH KING
          The old man. He's alive.

          TATTOO AND PIPER
          What?
          Piper tries to stand. Business Woman backhands her!

                         BUSINESS WOMAM
          Stay down! That's impossible!

                         TATTOO
          You shot him in the face! He can't--

                         JONAH KING
          Don't you see? We stand at the
          crossroads! Did you think we would
          just idly change the world? The
          forces of evil challenge us! This is
          wonderful! We show ourselves to be
          worthy. I'm so very proud of each
          one of you.
          Tattoo and Business Woman beam.
          Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby's face. The
          kid goes quiet as --
          The back glass SHATTERS.
          Everyone ducks!

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          Milton leans out the driver's side with the shotgun in his
          left hand, his one good eye squinting as --

          KAFOOM!
          He fires at the RV!
          He RATCHETS another shell into the chamber, takes aim
          then...hesitates...

                         IN REARVIEW
          The front end of a fast approaching vehicle!

          WHAM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          Milton's head snaps back as a 90 Corvette slams into the back
          of the GTO.

          EXT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin behind the wheel, her eyes insane.
          Behind the Corvette we see a â92 Lincoln, Thin Old Man
          driving. Truck Driving Woman in a â95 Viper.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton struggles to pull the shotgun back inside...struggles
          to keep the big GTO on the road.
          Distracted by the newcomers...we see what Milton does not.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The RV pulls off the road to the left.
          Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off.

                         MILTON
          Shit!
          He SLAMS on his brakes.

          INT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY

          Leopardskin's eyes go wide. Survival kicks in. She jerks
          the wheel.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - THE CHASE - DAY

          The Corvette slams into the side of the Viper!
          The Lincoln cuts hard right.
          All three cars shoot pass the GTO.
          Milton cuts the wheel left and floors it!

          INT. RV - DAY

          Piper watches as the bucking RV forces Jonah and Business
          Woman to turn their backs on her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Piper leaps from the couch, rushes up behind and shoves them
          toward the shattered back window!
          Jonah snatches a cabinet, drops his gun!
          It slides beneath the foldout bed.
          But Business Woman hits the giant opening and flips up and
          out of the RV!

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton looks up as Business Woman SLAMS into the ground and
          TUMBLES just out of his path. She sits up...dazed. Alive.
          Milton swerves...just enough...to...

          KAFWAM!
          What doesn't explode from the force KUH-THUMPS as the GTO
          bucks over her body.
          Milton grits through the pain. A bloody angry smile.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah stares out the back glass in shock.

                         PIPER
          Oops.

                         JONAH KING
          I am patient and forgiving, but
          that was wrong of you.
          He turns to her.

                         JONAH KING
          I'm going to kill you now. And
          then I'm going to rape your corpse.
          So that in the afterlife you might
          consider your sin this day.
          Piper CRACKS her knuckles.

                         PIPER
          Great. Between now and then.
          I'm'a fuck you up.
          He takes a step and swings a punch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          But she leaps at his face, closing the gap too quickly. Her
          French Manicure digs in. Jonah screams. They both go down!
          The baby WAILS.
          Skanky crawls into the cramped sleeper-bunk above the driver.
          Pulls the baby with her, tucks back into the corner, away
          from the battle in the RV's cabin.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton is gaining when --

          BOOM!
          The back glass SHATTERS.

          EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY

          Truck Driving Woman gains on Milton in her Viper. She's
          being blanketed in dust. BOOM! She fires a .44 Magnum.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          The radio and dash explode!

                         MILTON
          Son of a bitch.
          Milton snatches the 357, points it out the back glass and
          opens fire.

          BOOM!
          Milton's POV
          A white dot spider webs the Viper's windshield left.

          BOOM!
          Windshield middle!

          BOOM!
          The windshield suddenly turns red from the inside as a dot
          appears in front of the driver.
          The Viper jerks right drifts off of the dirt path!

                         FOOM

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          The Lincoln bursts through the dust cloud behind it. Thin
          Old Man leans from the driver's window, FIRES.
          Slugs PEPPER the GTO.
          Milton spins in his seat.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The RV has pulled ahead and vanishes over a hilltop.
          Milton FLOORS it!

          INT. RV - DAY

          Piper on top, Jonah's face looks like he ran into a barbed
          wire fence! He howls in pain and manages to slip a hand
          around her throat!
          Piper feels it. His fingers tighten. He shoves her away
          from him...she can no longer dig into his face.
          Her arms flail. Reaching for anything. Grasping.
          Her face turns red. Eyes bulge. Fuck.
          She claws his shirt open.
          And there...hanging around his neck is a small corkscrew.
          Chinese in design.
          She snatches it and --

          SHUNK!
          Stabs it into Jonah's shoulder, twists it deeper in.
          He SCREAMS. Releasing her!

          EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY

          Quiet.

          FOOM!
          GTO rockets over the hill top, clears the ground ten feet!
          The moment the GTO touches down, Milton BRAKES!
          Milton JOLTS the car into reverse! Tires SCREAM in protest!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          The GTO jerks backwards...climbing toward the top of the hill
          in reverse when Milton SNAPS the wheel.
          The GTO 180s, comes to rest just on this side of the hilltop.
          Milton casually leans out of the driver's side window with
          the shotgun in hand. He points it skyward as--

          FOOM!
          The Lincoln ROCKETS over the hilltop...and passes directly
          over the top of Milton.
          Milton's one good eye zeroes in on the massive gas tank
          beneath the back of the car.
          Milton squeezes the trigger.
          The back end of the Lincoln EXPLODES as --
          --The Corvette rockets over the hilltop!

          INT. CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin's face drops.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into the ground before her!
          Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as --

          EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY


          KER-FWAM!
          She slams into the burning vehicle and spins out of control!

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton kicks the car into drive, jerks a 180 and speeds off
          toward the RV.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah sits up...he pulls at the corkscrew and screams. It
          won't budge.
          He glares at Piper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.
          She scans for a weapon. Nothing. She snatches an umbrella
          from a coat rack. It'll have to do...
          There's a machete hanging beneath it.
          She drops the umbrella grabs the machete. Smiles at Jonah.

                         PIPER
          Give me the baby and I'll make the
          pain go away.
          Suddenly everyone SLAMS into the side of the RV!

          EXT. RV - DAY

          Tattoo pulls the RV back onto Highway 70!

          INT. RV - DAY

          Piper clings to the old stove. She watches in horror as --
          Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed. It slides
          right up to him.
          He snatches it.
          Piper leaps through the door.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton is gaining as --

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          Piper swings out, clinging to the door for dear life!

          EXT. RV - DAY

          Piper SLAMS into the side of the RV. She tries desperately
          to hold on as --
          Jonah leans through the door. Gun in hand.

                         JONAH KING
          Goodbye, child.

          MILTON (O.S.)
          Hey, dickless.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          Jonah looks up. Milton is driving beside them, shotgun in
          hand, barrel aimed right at Jonah!

          KUH-FWAM!
          But before Milton can get his shot off --
          The Corvette SLAMS into the back of the GTO!
          Milton fires! Blowing a hole in the side of the RV a foot to
          the right of Jonah's head!
          Jonah leaps back inside the RV.
          Piper clings on for dear life but she's slipping.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton jerks the wheel.

          INT. CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin slows as Milton's GTO goes into a spin.
          There's a smile on her face. She thinks he's lost control!
          Until the GTO does a 180. Milton now driving in reverse.
          His shotgun pointing through the remnants of windshield...
          ...directly at Lady in Leopardskin.

          BOOM!
          Her head goes buh-bye.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The Corvette swerves off of the road, jumps a ditch and flips
          thirty or forty times.

          EXT. RV - DAY

          Piper slips. Slips again. It's over. She knows it. Damn.
          She falls.

          FUMP.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          And lands on the hood of the GTO.

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          She looks up, through the GTO's windshield into Milton's
          battered face. He stretches his hand out to her. Piper
          snags it before slipping off into oblivion.

                         MILTON
          Got ya.
          Piper nods, crawls toward the windshield, Milton tries to
          pull her in as --

          KUH-THUNK....CRUNCHCHCHCH...
          A horrible sound of grinding metal roars from beneath the
          GTO's hood.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The GTO pulls to the side of the road.
          Milton leaps out and stares.
          He can just make out Jonah standing in the back window...
          holding his granddaughter.
          Piper eases from the hood.
          She stares at her bandanna, at the blood on his face.

                         PIPER
          Jesus, Milton. How?
          She pulls him close...looks at the back of his head.

                         MILTON
          It's still in there. The bullet. I
          can feel it.

                         PIPER
          But how...how are you still alive?
          He stares back toward the RV. Just a dot on the horizon now.

                         MILTON
          Ain't got time to die.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         PIPER
          I tried, Milton. I tried to get
          her back.

                         MILTON
          I know, baby. I know. Jonah only
          had about twenty followers. We
          hurt him good today.

                         PIPER
          Fuckin devil worshipers freak me
          out. They mess with powers that
          should be left alone. Turns my
          shit white.

                         MILTON
          Powers. It's all bullshit.

                         PIPER
          No, Milton. It's real. Ghosts,
          UFOs, bigfoot, that's the bullshit.
          The Devil and demons? Once those
          doors are opened you're fucked.
          Milton rolls his one good eye.
          Piper turns back to the GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine.

                         PIPER
          What do we do now?

                         MILTON
          I used to know a guy lived out this
          way. You got one of them portable
          phones?

                         PIPER
          Portable phones? You mean a cell
          phone? Yeah, in my bag.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAY


          WE ARE CLOSE ON THE CRACKED EARTH
          As a hand slams into view, fingers with dirt crusted nails
          curl...dig into the ground.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Man With Wig crawls toward us. He's pale. Eyes dim.

          PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          His busted, mangled legs have left a slug trail of blood and
          fluid stretching back to the highway.
          Left hand hits the ground, right hand digs into the dirt. He
          drags himself forward a few inches.

                         HIS POV
          He's crawling toward the Station Wagon.
          Someone...somewhere...is HUMMING
          Wig turns, squints.

          A SILHOUETTE APPROACHES
          Back lit by the early day sun. There's a bounce in his step.
          Wig holds his hand out to the savior as--
          The Accountant's smiling face becomes clear.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Scorcher today, huh?
          He takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle.

          MAN WITH WIG
          Help me...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Christ on a cracker. My apologies.
          The Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into
          the shade of the Station Wagon where he flips him around into
          a sitting position.
          Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above
          his left breast.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What's that supposed to mean?

          MAN WITH WIG
          It's a symbol of our pact with Lord
          Satan.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Pact huh? That's cute. Funny he's
          never mentioned you.
          Wig stares down at his mangled legs. The Accountant notices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Yeah, those are fucked. Here, have
          some water.
          Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Milton's work I take it?

          MAN WITH WIG
          Ran me over with his...how do
          you...? Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant. I'm curious.
          And I never get curious. What do
          you people want with Milton?

          MAN WITH WIG
          You're the who?
          The Accountant smiles, places his hand around Wig's clearly
          shattered femur and squeezes.
          Wig's body convulses! He SCREAMS.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Does it matter? Milton. Why is he
          important to you?

          MAN WITH WIG
          He isn't! He's the one chasing us!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Why?
          Wig stares...searches for an answer.
          The Accountant snatches a mangled ankle and twists. Wig's
          body stiffens and he SCREAMS.

          MAN WITH WIG
          Because! Because of what we did.
          Because of who we took.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Color me curious. What DID you do
          and who DID you take?

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DEAD GTO - DAY


                         CLOSE ON

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          The blood stained pink bandanna. The wind pushes it gently
          down the black asphalt.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Milton sits on the GTO's hood. Piper stands between his legs
          cleaning his wound.

                         PIPER
          Lemme know if I hurt you.

                         MILTON
          Do what you gotta do. You get used
          to the pain.
          Piper pulls a black bandanna from her pack, there are white
          skulls on it. She folds it, ties it around Milton's head.

                         PIPER
          There. That's better.
          When she moves aside we see she's lined up a skull over his
          missing eye.

          A VEHICLE APPROACHES.
          Milton slides from the hood, steps protectively in front of
          Piper as a banged up wrecker pulls toward them, pulls to the
          side of the road.

          POV FROM APPROACHING VEHICLE
          From this angle it looks as though an innocent old man and
          his granddaughter are having car trouble.

          POV FROM BEHIND THE GTO
          From this angle we can see Milton concealing the shotgun
          behind him. Piper stands close, her hand on the handle of
          the 357 protruding from his waistband.

                         ON WRECKER
          As the DRIVER steps out...stands half hidden by the door as

                         WE --

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          Like Piper, the Driver has his right hand tucked behind his
          back, wrapped around the handle of a .44 Magnum.

          DRIVER (O.S.)
          Thought you were dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          Now we get a good look at him. His name's WEBSTER. An old
          black man, as tough as Milton is angry.

                         PIPER
          Why does everyone keep saying that?

                         WEBSTER
          Because he IS dead. Sure as shit
          supposed to be anyway.
          Webster and Milton eye one another for a long beat then --

                         WEBSTER
          I carried your coffin, old man. I
          was there the day we put your ass
          in the ground.
          Piper stares at Milton. Milton stares at Webster.

                         MILTON
          Webster, you gonna yank that .44 or
          just keep stroking it?

                         WEBSTER
          That depends. How's this possible?

                         MILTON
          You heard about my daughter?

                         WEBSTER

                         (SOFTENS SLIGHTLY)
          I did.

                         MILTON
          Then you know why I'm back.

                         PIPER
          Back? Back from where? What. The
          Fuck. Are you two talking about?!

                         WEBSTER
          It true they took the little one?
          Milton nods.
          Webster considers for a long beat, then releases the .44.

                         WEBSTER
          Put her in neutral. I'll pull the
          truck around.
          But Piper can't tear her eyes away from Milton.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Police tape, half a dozen state and county cruisers. Three
          meat wagons and a news van. Humans buzz the scene like
          insects. The two dead State Troopers lie where they fell.
          Undisturbed. ROOKIE stands out. Young, county uniform, wide
          eyed. Very busy at having no idea what he should be doing.
          He scans the ground. His eyes go even wider.

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge! Sarge look at this!
          Rookie squats to the ground as SARGE, leather skin,
          approaches, stares, frowns.

                         SARGE
          Yeah?

                         ROOKIE
          Cigarette butt.

                         SARGE
          I see that.

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge! It's less than twenty feet
          from the victims!

                         SARGE
          And less than three feet from the
          ash bin.
          Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred
          cigarette butts salute the sky.

                         SARGE
          Pay attention, Rookie.
          But Rookie's attention has quickly OCD'd elsewhere.

                         ROOKIE
          Hey!

                         HIS POV
          CAP, an American Indian man walks the crime scene. Jeans,
          cowboy boots, a âDumbledore Dies On Page 596â sweatshirt.
          His dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are
          all business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         ROOKIE
          You! You can't be here!
          Rookie rushes forward.

                         SARGE
          Rookie!

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge, this joker can't just stomp
          around the crime scene.
          Sarge catches up, nods with respect to Cap.

                         SARGE
          Captain. Sorry about that.
          Cap looks up then stares at Rookie's feet.

                         CAP
          One of yours?

                         SARGE
          Yessir, I won't let it happen
          again.

                         CAP
          Get him out of here.

                         SARGE
          Cap, he's green, that's all.

                         CAP
          He's standing on evidence.
          Rookie leaps back revealing two shell casings.
          Cap kneels, stares.

                         CAP

          357.
          Suddenly a Unformed Officer leans from within the bar.

                         UNIFORMED OFFICER
          Cap! We got a live one.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Several officers motion Cap behind the bar toward an open
          cabinet. Cap crosses to the cabinet and kneels.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          Candy hides within. Naked, hugs her knees. Shivers.

                         CAP

                         (TO MEN)
          Get me a blanket. And get a medic
          in here.
          He turns to Candy, offers a comforting smile.

                         CAP
          You're gonna be okay now. I won't
          let anything happen to you.

                         CANDY
          He...he killed them. He killed all
          of them.

                         CAP
          Who did?

                         CANDY
          No. You don't understand, we was
          fuckin'. He killed them while we was
          fuckin'. That's never happened to me
          before, has it happened to you?
          Cap turns to Sarge who is standing near.

                         CAP
          Let's get a shrink in here too.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S WRECKER - DUSK - EST.

          A giant barn surrounded by an army of muscle car's laid to
          rest on cement blocks.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DUSK

          Engines dangle from assorted winches. Auto tools hang from
          the walls. Stacks of tires, a pile of carburetors.
          Webster throws a lever.
          The wrecker winch lowers the GTO.
          Piper crosses to the front, pops the hood. Webster joins
          her, stares at the engine. Frowns.

                         WEBSTER
          Engine's shot to hell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         PIPER
          Can you fix it?
          He leans close, hands caress the engine, searching.
          Somewhere near a fire CRACKLES. Piper turns.

                         HER POV
          Milton stands just through the barn doors, stokes a fire
          within a 50 gallon drum. Flames rising.

                         PIPER
          I don't...how is this possible?

                         WEBSTER
          He loved his daughter.

                         PIPER
          Lots of daddy's love their
          daughters, doesn't explain
          shattering reality.

                         WEBSTER
          That one loved his little girl
          enough to make her hate him.
          (off her stare)
          Like Timmy yellin' at Lassie to go
          home?
          Piper looks even more confused.

                         WEBSTER
          You never watched...forget it.
          Milton was a bad husband but he was
          a good father. Used to say it was
          the only thing he was ever good at.
          Then we went and got mixed up with
          the wrong crowd. Power and money
          and once you're in there ain't no
          gettin' out. So to keep her safe
          he vanished the year before she
          went off to college.

                         PIPER
          Obviously you got out.
          Webster glances at Milton for a moment.

                         WEBSTER
          The bastards we were workin' for, they
          were gonna kill us when the job was
          done.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         WEBSTER (CONT'D)
          So the day before, Milton paid'em a
          little visit. He went alone you see.
          I didn't know. I would'a gone with him
          but I didn't know.
          Webster goes very quiet.

                         WEBSTER
          Being a daddy wasn't the only thing
          Milton was good at. Sumbitch was
          good at being a friend.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DUSK

          The sun's setting to the West. Milton stands dangerously
          close to the fire. Stares at the dancing flames.

          WEBSTER (O.S.)
          That fire makin you homesick?
          Piper and Webster approach with a six pack.

                         WEBSTER
          Cold beer?
          Milton gazes up at the moon. It isn't full but it's close.
          The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it.

                         MILTON
          You know the pain and suffering
          ain't the worse part, right?
          That's what they tell ya, what they
          want you to believe. But it's all
          a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst
          part's the goddamn video feed.
          Webster and Piper exchange a glance.

                         MILTON
          It ain't about the fire and brimstone.
          Ain't about your suffering. It's
          about the suffering of them you love.
          Cuz you see it. You see it all. In
          full goddamn detail. And there ain't
          nothin you can do about it.
          Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL into the air.

                         MILTON
          Fuckin son-in-law. He looked like
          one of them tree-huggin piece of
          shits. Wore sandals. What kind of
          man wears fuckin sandals?

          76.

                         MILTON (CONT'D)

                         (A BEAT)
          But I saw how he died. Fought like
          a fuckin banshee.
          Milton goes quiet.

                         MILTON
          He loved that daughter of mine.
          Loved that little baby too. He
          kept fightin long after he should'a
          been dead. But some people's
          better at killin than others. Just
          how they're wired.
          Milton's finding it harder to speak.

                         MILTON
          Then them sons of bitches turned on
          my...nosir, physical pain is nothin
          compared to watching your baby
          girl...watchin those fuckers...I'm
          gonna kill'em. I'm gonna kill'em
          all. And...and then I'll be done.
          Milton finally goes silent.
          Piper makes a noise. Involuntary. Tears stream down her
          cheeks. She's trying not to sob.
          Webster looks steely. Determined.

                         WEBSTER
          Milton, I can't fix that car. But
          I can get you were you need to be.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - NIGHT

          A huge sliding barn door opens into a giant stall revealing a
          1969 Chevrolet Nova 396 L-78 and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro.
          Milton and Piper stare. Webster smiles.

                         WEBSTER
          Milt, if memory serves you were
          always partial to the Nova, yes?

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DISTANT RIDGE - NIGHT

          We're staring down over the barn from a distant ridge as we
          hear the GLASS-PACKED RUMBLE of the Nova's engine.

          Yeah, about that fella who killed
          all them people at the Bull by the
          Balls last night. The fella who

          Milton crosses to the 69 Nova. Stops. Stares.

          Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat.

                         MILTON
          What are you doing?
          Piper pops awake, sits up. Already angry.

                         PIPER
          Fuck are you doing?!
          Milton stares.

                         PIPER
          Think you were gonna sneak off by
          yourself?! Go it alone?!

                         MILTON
          Uh, no. I need your help. If
          you're still willing.
          Piper stares for a moment.

                         PIPER
          Oh.
          A beat.

                         PIPER
          Well if I'd known that I would have

          Milton opens the big barn doors as Piper drives the Nova out
          into the sun light.
          Webster approaches with a shotgun and a box of shells.

          Mapquest says it's an eight hour

          pig from the marsh?

                         MILTON
          Black tears of oil?

                         WEBSTER
          Damn right.

                         MILTON
          Webster, I need you to stay here.

                         WEBSTER
          Wha? No. You went alone last time.

                         MILTON
          I'm not going alone this time.
          Piper's coming with me.

                         WEBSTER
          You take that little girl over me?

                         MILTON
          Give me the fuckin shells. And the gun.
          Milton snatches both and hands them to Piper. He then
          quickly places an arm around Webster's shoulders and walks
          him out of earshot.
          Piper places the gun and shells in the backseat then stares
          at the two men.
          They glance back at her several times. Then Webster nods.
          Milton returns, slides into the passenger seat.

                         MILTON
          Let's go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Piper stares out the window as Webster slips quietly into the
          barn. He does so reluctantly.

                         PIPER
          He's not coming?

                         MILTON
          He's too old. He'll just slow us
          down. Get himself killed.

                         PIPER
          That's what you told him?

                         MILTON
          That's what Timmy told Lassie isn't it?

                         PIPER
          Who the fuck is this Timmy and
          Lassie you two keep talking about?!

                         MILTON
          This ain't gonna be easy, Piper. I
          need you. That's no lie. But are
          you sure about this?

                         PIPER
          Just drive the damn car.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - BORDER - DAY

          We see a âWelcome to Nevadaâ sign as --
          The Nova THUNDERS past.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Milton behind the wheel, Piper has her bare feet on the
          windshield as she loads shotgun shells into the slits on a
          hunting vest.

                         PIPER
          I never knew him. Momma said he
          was a drifter.

                         MILTON
          I ain't your daddy.

                         PIPER
          Fuck you if you are.
          Milton notices something in the rear view.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MILTON
          Shit.
          Piper sits up, stares.

          THROUGH BACK GLASS
          There's a State Trooper's car way back there. Fuck. There
          are two. No lights yet but they are coming up fast.

                         PIPER
          What do we do?

                         MILTON
          Nothing yet. Not until...
          The lights come on.

                         PIPER
          Oh shit. They know.

                         MILTON
          We can't stop.
          Milton mashes the peddle to the floor.

                         PIPER
          Milton, this will never work.

                         MILTON
          It'll work.

                         PIPER
          No. It won't. Nobody gets away
          anymore. In fifteen minutes there
          will be choppers, we'll be all over
          the news...
          She breaks off. Her mouth drops.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police
          barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway
          in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line
          the side of the road.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          Twenty cruisers. Thirty TROOPERS are set up behind their
          vehicles, shotguns and assault rifles in hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Cap, the American Indian Police Captain, stands in front, a
          radio to his mouth.

                         CAP
          Just keep driving him to us. We'll
          do the rest. And make sure you
          peel off before the fireworks.
          He lowers the handset, addresses the men.

                         CAP
          Gentlemen, these two killed two of
          our own. I know you'd like them to
          pay. Therefore, when I tell you to
          aim for the tires, what I mean is
          aim for their heads. Are we clear?
          The men nod with steely determination.

                         CAP
          Very good. Please aim for the tires.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          The barricade is approaching stupidly fast. For the first
          time on this adventure, Milton looks...concerned.

                         PIPER
          Just don't stop.

                         MILTON
          Too many of them.

                         PIPER
          Just keep driving.

                         MILTON
          I'm...I'm sorry I got you into--

                         PIPER
          --They took your granddaughter,
          Milton, and now these badge-wearing
          fuckers are trying to stop you.
          You crawled out of the Goddamn
          abyss...and a few fat-assed county
          Mounties are giving you pause?
          Your grand-baby needs you.
          Milton nods. Turns back to the road.

                         PIPER
          You know what happens to her if
          they stop us.

                         PIPER (CONT'D)
          You lose the last connection you
          will ever have to this world. You
          gotta drive.
          A scowl crosses his face.

                         PIPER
          No. You don't just drive. Drive
          angry! Drive with the motherfuckin'
          rage that'll take us through that
          motherfuckin' roadblock!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          Sarge from earlier approaches Cap.

                         SARGE
          He ain't stopping.

                         CAP
          Good. Makes our job easier.
          Suddenly a noise catches them off guard. They turn behind
          them. Their eyes widen.

                         THEIR POV
          A Mack Truck RUMBLES over the bridge approaching from behind
          them. It's pulling 80mph at least.

                         CAP
          Well...this is unexpected.

          INT. MACK TRUCK - DAY

          The Accountant is driving. Calm. Whistling.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Piper and Milton stare.

                         PIPER
          Uh...what is that?

                         MILTON
          Get down!

          Cap and Sarge scatter! Several Troopers leap or slide down
          into the ravine as --

          KU-FWAM!
          The Mack BARRELS THOUGH THE BARRICADE!
          Several Cruisers go airborne, sailing directly at us!

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Milton cuts the wheel hard as one of the Cruisers ROCKETS
          right at them.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          The Cruiser's front end, hits the blacktop, digs in and flips
          over! The Nova SCREAMS beneath it!
          The radio antenna SNAPS!

          INT. MACK TRUCK - DAY

          The Accountant smiles. Then cuts the wheel. Hard.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          The Mack jackknifes.
          It slides sideways down the road toward the Nova!

          Shotgun!
          Piper shoves the shotgun in his hand. He quickly shoves it
          out the window and --

          The hydraulics line BURSTS! Hydraulic fluid bleeds like a
          stuck jugular!
          The metal brackets holding the trailer in place...RELEASE!

          EXT. MACK TRUCK - DAY

          Truck and Flatbed separate!
          The back of the flatbed catches on a cruiser. The front
          flips around.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          We can just make out the Accountant's face. He's smiling.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          The Nova rips through the opening between truck and trailer!
          And then blazes past the scattered and overturned cruisers
          and tears onto the bridge!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          Cap staggers into the road, FIRING at the Nova!

                         CAP
          Hurry! After them!
          Those men still near, scramble toward the working vehicles as

          SCRRREEEECH.
          The Mack skids to a stop behind them, now parallel across the
          blacktop. Driver's side angled back at the bridge.
          Every gun in the area spins as the driver's side door opens.
          The Accountant steps out, big smile on his face.

          CLOSE ON SARGE AND CAP

                         SARGE
          You want us to shoot out his tires?

                         ON ACCOUNTANT
          As he smiles and flips his coin high into the air.
          The surrounding Troopers stare.
          The Accountant catches it. Holds it high between thumb and
          forefinger for all to see.

          POV FROM TROOPERS
          He's holding an FBI badge in the air.

                         CAP
          No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way
          in God's good heaven are you a...
          The Accountant steps down, thrusting his âbadge' into Cap's
          face stopping him cold.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Need you boys to stand down. Captain,
          you know what this badge means, right?
          Not a single gun lowers. All trained at The Accountant.
          Itching to blow him out of his expensive shoes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Federal Bureau of get the fuck
          outta my way. You boys have
          blundered into an on-going Federal
          case. Now, lower your...
          He stops, turns...sniffs the air.
          His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED TROOPER.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You.
          ANGLE - Looking down on The Accountant surrounded by armed
          angry troopers. He steps from the truck, nudges Cap aside
          like he wasn't there. Cap can't believe it.
          Shot continues, moving down, closer and closer until the
          Accountant is face to face with a Young Faced Trooper.
          The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Suddenly the Accountant moves fast. He bats the gun aside,
          snatches the kid's uniform shirt and pulls it open, popping
          two buttons.

                         YOUNG-FACED TROOPER
          Hey, Hey!!! Cap!
          And there...above the kid's left breast...a pentagram tattoo.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It seems you're serving two masters.
          The kid says nothing stares. Every cop's gun is sighted on
          the Accountant. He doesn't seem to notice.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Take out your phone and call him.
          Call Jonah King. Tell him the old
          man is dead.
          The kid stares until...

                         CAP
          Go ahead, Trooper. Do as the agent
          says. Rest of you. Stand down. Now!
          Guns lower. The kid removes his cell phone and dials.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY

          We tear West down the highway as we catch up to the Nova and
          dive down...toward the back glass until --

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Piper stares through the back window.

                         PIPER
          I don't think...why aren't they
          following us?
          Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face.

                         MILTON
          They're likely scared of you.

                         PIPER
          Now what?

                         MILTON
          Now we drive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          We pull back...

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY

          ...out of the back glass as the Nova speeds up.
          Faster...faster. The sun suddenly time lapses across the
          sky. The landscape blurs. Only the Nova and the moving sun
          remain...until the sun dips into the Western horizon and
          vanishes...replaced by one hell of a bright full moon.

          EXT. SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA - NIGHT

          Suddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a
          rocky outcropping in the distance.
          We slow and drop toward the ground until we're mere inches
          above the cracked earth...we come to a stop.

                         FOOM
          A BOOT slams into view.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT

          Milton climbs from the Nova. In the distance we can hear
          DRUMS. BONGOS. There's CHANTING. And LAUGHTER.
          Piper rises and gazes at him over the roof. She's scared.
          Milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband, slides the
          ancient revolver into a leather hip-holster then he leans in
          and grabs his shotgun.

                         MILTON
          Stay here.
          Piper nods.
          Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon
          we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton
          moves toward a cliff's edge.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

          Milton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge.

                         MILTON'S POV

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          A twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below. The ravine
          is filled with giant oil derricks, like metallic T-Rex's,
          rising and falling to the SHRIEK of oiled metal.
          And in the center of this Jurassic gathering, a CROWD of
          people dance and sway around a giant bonfire. It is
          celebration, ritual and orgy rolled into one.
          Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the
          opposite side of the Oil-Rig ravine - the battered RV sits
          like a mobile command post.

          CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
          He was expecting less than twenty followers. There are forty
          down there. Fuck.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT

          Milton walks slowly back toward the Nova. His head lowered
          in deep thought. How does one man and a kid take on forty?
          Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face!
          He jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead.

                         HIS POV
          Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant.

                         MILTON
          Get away from her.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I think not.

                         MILTON
          I shoot you with this, you know
          what it means. No heaven. No
          hell. You cease to exist.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          All the more reason to keep Ms.
          Piper in close proximity. You are
          old, Milton. You might miss again.

                         MILTON
          You can't stop me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Stop you? Milton, you wouldn't be
          here without me, you ungrateful
          shit. That roadblock back there,
          that would have stopped you. So I
          want you to drop that iron God-
          Killer and say thank you.
          Milton stares.
          The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick,
          suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I said, drop it and thank you.
          Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the
          darkness behind him.

                         MILTON
          Don't hurt her. Th-Thank you.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's better.
          He lowers the blade, but keeps Piper close.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You're not the first to get out and
          I doubt you'll be the last but I
          gotta know, HOW did you get out
          with the God-Killer?

                         MILTON

                         (CHUCKLES)
          I just walked in and took it.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You did not.

                         MILTON
          I'm an old washed up lifer. Never
          occurred to'em that I was up to no good.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Wouldn't wanna be you when he finds
          out.

                         MILTON
          What's he gonna do? Not let me
          back in? Now, I gotta know. Why?
          Why help me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         PIPER
          I know why. It's because of those
          crazy fucks out there isn't it?
          They figured something out didn't
          they? Somehow they know how to
          summon a piece of hell to earth.
          The Accountant laughs.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's cute. You haven't told her?

                         MILTON
          She don't listen.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a
          little secret. The Dark Lord?
          Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply
          the warden of a very large prison.
          Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful.
          Well read. I happen to know the
          idea of sacrificing children in his
          honor annoys him greatly.

                         MILTON
          Then why? Why help me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Simple. Like the warden, we all
          have jobs to do. Getting you here
          makes my job easier. You get what
          you want, I get what I want.

                         MILTON
          Then help me, now. There are forty of
          them down there. You and I could--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No.

                         MILTON

                         BUT--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No. You want to save her then go
          do it. If you win, I win. If they
          take you down, I win.
          He hugs Piper closer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You like butter on your popcorn?
          It's sure to be a grand show.
          Piper doesn't know what to say.
          The Accountant glances back at Milton.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You're still here? Milton, the clock
          is ticking. Midnight approaches.

                         MILTON
          Then get off my fuckin car.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          The RV door flings open revealing Jonah King. He walks with
          arrogance through the orgy around him, his followers turn to
          him with reverence. His name is WHISPERED like a secret.
          He approaches the make-shift stone altar where Skanky Gal
          holds the baby within a bundle of blankets.
          HIGH ABOVE: the moon is full and ripe.

                         JONAH KING
          It's almost time.
          Skanky Gal nods. But there is hesitation in her eyes. She's
          grown attached to the baby.
          Jonah takes the baby, places her on the stone altar.

                         JONAH KING
          My brothers and sisters, we have come
          so far. To this place where the
          dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul
          at our feet. From its death, it shall
          be reborn. As we will be. We who
          have survived the slings. The
          arrows. The revulsion of those too
          weak to believe. We have been cast
          out. And hunted. But no more.
          Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck.
          Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably
          elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah.
          The Followers GASP in holy awe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         JONAH KING
          (raising the knife)
          With this sacrifice, no more will
          we be shunned. They say the meek
          will inherit. They LIE. We are
          not meek. We are chosen. The
          hounds of perdition will howl at
          our command. For now we...
          A HOWLING noise.
          No. An engine. Distant but thunderous.
          Heads turn. The sound echoes throughout the ravine then --

          FOOOM!
          The NOVA ROCKETS from the cliff's edge!
          It plummets straight at the cultists!
          They scatter! But three are not so lucky, they vanish as the
          giant Chevy turns them to PULP!
          Jonah's jaw drops. This can't fuckin' be.
          Skanky Gal, grabs the baby and flees toward one of the giant
          oil derricks!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton wears a mask of rage as he rips the Nova into a 180,
          his 357 aimed out the window.

          KABOOM! BOOM! KUHFWOOM!
          He's shooting Cultists in a barrel.
          But the Nova is the better weapon. He FLOORS it, then LOCKS
          the brakes, fishtailing.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          The Nova's ass-end veers like a dragon's tail SMACKING
          cultists aside with BONE-SHATTERING brutality.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          Jonah grabs a shotgun from behind the altar, opens FIRE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JONAH KING
          Kill him! KILL HIM!
          Followers produce an assortment of firepower and RIDDLE the
          Nova with lead!
          Milton sights Jonah, ready to blow him to fuck, catches the
          reverend while he cocks the pump.
          JONAH can see Milton's got him.
          MILTON grits and pulls the 357's trigger: Click. Click.

          BLAM!
          Jonah fires a fresh round - barely missing as--
          Milton GUNS the engine - SMASHES two followers head on. They
          fly up the hood, SMASH the glass - but shield him from
          another frontal assault. Their bodies RIDDLED with lead.
          The Cultists circle him to get a better shot.
          A Magnum is thrust into the driver's side window - right in
          Milton's face.
          He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
          wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the
          fucker's hand. The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton.
          Milton twirls the Magnum, gunslinger style. Jams the barrel
          into the Cultist's face and FIRES.
          Milton runs down any that get in his way.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

          The Accountant stands above the battle, Piper at his side.
          He can hear her heartbeat.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You want to help him.

                         PIPER
          Yes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He chose you, you know that. Fast
          car, spunky attitude. He put your
          life at risk and you still want to
          help him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         PIPER
          Yes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Then go.
          She rushes toward a goat path leading down to the valley
          below. Suddenly something catches her eye.

          CLOSE ON GROUND
          The Ancient Revolver.
          Without the slightest pause, Piper snatches it, spins and
          aims it right at...
          The Accountant's smiling face.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Hold on tight. It has quite a kick.

                         PIPER
          If I kill you, you can't take him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Someone else will come...someone
          else always comes.
          Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Piper, he didn't steal that gun to
          kill me. He stole it to slow me down.
          He's getting what he wanted. Now, go
          to him. Before it's too late.
          Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path.

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with
          bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain
          down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Ducking in the seat, unable to see, Milton fights to keep

                         CONTROL UNTIL:
          Jonah BLASTS the front driver's side tire, SHREDDING it -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          The NOVA pitches hard to the left, PIN-WHEELING right into an
          oil derrick.
          The SCREAM of metal on metal rips through the ravine. The
          Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips
          from the wreck.
          Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around
          the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door.
          Jonah nods to Tattoo who approaches close to the ground,
          reaches out slowly and YANKS the door open.

          KA-FOOM!
          Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast!

                         JONAH KING
          Kill him!
          Jonah and his men open FIRE!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He
          clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite
          the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Jonah and his men draw closer and closer.

                         THEIR POV
          Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open
          driver's side door.

          PIPER (O.S.)

          HEY!
          The men spin to find Piper standing behind them, ancient
          revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the trigger.

          KAFOOM!
          Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off her feet, the gun
          jerked from her hands.
          She lands on her back. Hard. The wind KNOCKED out of her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          The GOD SLUG slams into a cultist's stomach. It EXPLODES
          through him, and into the BATTERED RV BEHIND:

          KABLAAAAM!
          The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and cultists helter
          skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five.
          JONAH is spattered with his men's blood, dives behind the
          wreck of the Nova.

                         JONAH KING
          Well...this has all gone to shit.
          He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the
          Nova's open driver's side door.

                         HIS POV
          Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone.
          Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But
          nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find...
          Milton crawling. Bleeding.

          MILTON'S POV
          Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick.
          The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms.
          Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won.
          He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin.

                         JONAH KING
          You lose.

                         (LOOKS UP)
          Get over here!
          Skanky continues to cower. Doesn't budge.

                         JONAH KING
          I said get over here! I want him
          to watch me kill the kid!
          Skanky doesn't move.

                         JONAH KING

                         (TO MILTON)
          Stupid bitch. Fine. Then just
          know I promise to kill her slowly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Jonah raises the barrel to Milton's forehead then...
          Someone near CLEARS HIS THROAT.
          Jonah turns, stares.
          The Accountant leans against the Nova's hulk. He winks.
          At Jonah's feet, Milton scrambles forward and we realize he
          wasn't crawling toward his grand-baby.
          He was crawling toward the ancient revolver.
          He snatches it, rolls onto his back as--
          Jonah swings his gun toward Milton --

          KAFOOM!
          The burning God Slug HITS JONAH IN THE FACE!
          Jonah's head is obliterated. The force yanks his headless
          body into the air, spins it sky-wards in a plume of flame.
          The Accountant moves away, watching as --
          The burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the Nova.

          THE GAS IGNITES
          FLAMES ERUPT with THUNDER clear to the heavens - the Nova
          ROARS one final time, living up to it's name in a furious
          ball of fire that consumes whatever's left of Jonah King.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire lighting her face.

                         PIPER
          Milton?!
          He lies on his back several yards away.
          Piper rushes up, falls beside him.
          He's alive, mouth filled with blood. She takes his hand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Skanky Gal looks up to find...
          ...the Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          She hands him the baby.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm curious. Would you have let
          him do it?
          She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's what I thought.
          He turns and walks away from her.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          See you. Soon.
          Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness.

          ON MILTON AND PIPER

                         PIPER
          Milton...no...
          Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick
          around. Searching.

                         MILTON
          Where...where is she?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          She's here.
          The Accountant hands the baby to Milton.
          Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes.
          Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way.
          He places her in Piper's arms.

                         MILTON
          Keep her safe.

                         PIPER
          I will. Anyone tries to hurt her
          and I'll kill'em.

                         MILTON
          I know. That's why I chose you.

          A HORN BLARES.
          They all turn toward the high cliff.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         THEIR POV
          WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro.

                         MILTON
          Webster will look after you both.
          As long as he can. And he'll keep
          trying long after he can't.

                         PIPER
          Milton. This can't...you can't
          just give up. There's gotta be
          something we can do to...

                         MILTON
          Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna
          happen. I'm askin more than I have
          a right to. I know it. But love
          her for me, Piper. Love her and
          make her yours. I don't have any
          right to ask for your promise...

                         PIPER

                         (WITHOUT HESITATION)
          I promise. Milton. I promise.
          Milton coughs.

                         MILTON
          Thank you.
          And like that. The life fades from his eyes.
          Piper holds the baby close, SOBS.
          She looks up at the Accountant. But he is gone.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - DAWN

          The sun glows to the east as --
          --Piper cradles the baby as she climbs the goat path where
          Webster is waiting. He rushes to her, places an arm around
          her. Leads her toward the Camaro as --

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - DAWN


          CLOSE ON MILTON
          He twitches.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          His one good eye opens. It rolls around then settles on
          something above.

                         MILTON
          How was that?

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          The Accountant stands over him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I've seen better. Guess she
          doesn't know you can beat him, slow
          him, shoot him, even stop him...

                         MILTON
          ...But you can't kill a dead man.
          Milton sits up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out.
          The Accountant takes it. Pulls him to his feet.
          They turn and walk toward the rising sun.
          They walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright
          yellow glow...then...
          ...they fade into the shimmering heat...
          ...and they are gone.

          FADE TO BLACK.


          THE END
