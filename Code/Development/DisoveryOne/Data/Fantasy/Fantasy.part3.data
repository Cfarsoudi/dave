          EXT. HIGH PLAINS - HILLSIDE - DAY

          A COYOTE lopes through shimmering heat waves. The sky above
          is a cloudless blue.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          My Father used to say that the only way
          Evil came into your life was if you
          invited it. I'm not sure about that, at
          least not anymore. What I cLQ know is
          this: we are born alone, and we die
          alone, and what happens in between is all
          that matters. The choices we make, the
          people whose paths we cross -- these are
          the things that determine our fate.
          The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link fence, weaves
          through the rusted ruins of a --

          DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK
          Broken-down rides, weed-clogged machinery, sideshow trailers
          bleached bone-white.

          WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Most stories start with a beginning. His
          began with an ending. I never knew where
          he really came from. I guess it's not
          important anymore. All I know is that
          he'd been running his entire life.
          Running for so long that he no longer
          knew whether he was running away from

                         SOMETHING --
          The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks out over a patchy
          Southwestern town.

          WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          -- or towards it.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. BAD IRON BIKE REPAIR - DAY

          Sparks, noise, metal and grime. JOHN BLAZE (30s, ruggedly
          handsome) is running late. He sprints across the workshop
          floor, shedding his welder's kit as he heads for the time clock.
          CLUNK! He punches out -- but LITTLE MIKE (50s, trailer trash
          fast) has caught him in the act.

                         LITTLE MIKE
          where do you chink you're going, Blaze?

                         CONTINUED:

                         BLAZE
          Sick, cutting out early.

                         LITTLE MIKE
          The hell you are!
          Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered BSA.

          LITTLE MIKE (CONT'D)
          Get back to work or your ass is fired!

                         BLAZE
          Aaa n? You say that every time.
          Blaze kicks-starts the bike. It ROARS thunderously.

                         LITTLE MIKE
          (over the noise)
          Well I mean it this time!

                         BLAZE
          (gunning the throttle)
          See you tomorrow, Little Mike!
          The bike HOWLS, hauls up on its back wheel. Screams out the
          shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears. The other workers
          WHOOP and HOLLER, especially when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT-
          CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the fly.

          EXT. BAD IRON SHOP YARD/DIRT ROAD - DAY

          Blaze skids out of the yard, matching speed with a pickup
          which is just passing by. COOP is driving. JED and MURPHY
          are LAUGHING in back. Clearly, they're friends with Blaze.

                         JED

                         (SHOUTING)
          Skin of your teeth, man!

                         MURPHY
          (tapping his watch)
          Yeah, we're on a tight schedule!

                         BLAZE
          So what are you waiting for?
          Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          EXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY

          A FREIGHT TRAIN thunders across the landscape. To the East
          Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course.
          Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to
          the tracks. Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted
          container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his
          saddles bags --
          -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy
          iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia.
          Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away --
          -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He
          jams the front brake on at the last possible moment --
           The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three-
          sixty up into the car --

          INSIDE THE CAR
          -- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS
          his exhilaration. And if you don't believe this, watch
          extreme motocross as we CUT TO:

          THE OPPOSITE DOOR
          being wrenched aside, revealing Coop's pickup holding steady
          alongside the train. Jed and Murphy ride the cargo bed like
          surfers.
           Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck.
          Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em. We get glimpses of
           the loot: CD Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage --

                         JED
          Christ, Mickey was right on the money!

                         BLAZE
          Car twenty-two!

                         MURPHY

                         (LAUGHING)
          Candy from a baby!
          The boxes keep coming, like baggage at the airport. Some
          boxes miss the mark, fall short, get mangled. A box bursts
          against Murphy's chest, engulfs him in an explosion of paper
          and polystyrene beads. The others howl with LAUGHTER, riding
          high on this Great Train Robbery as -

          4.

                         CONTINUED:
          -- Blaze hears something, looks over his shoulder. He SEES a
          POLICE CRUISER, far in the distance, burning towards them.

                         BLAZE
          Thank you gentlemen, that's it for today!
          Jed bangs on the cab roof. Coop waves. Jed and Murphy
          salute. The pickup peels away. Blaze retrieves his bike.
          Stands it back up, kicks it alive, guns the throttle and --
          -- cold jumps straight out of the car. Seconds later he's
          powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards
          the horizon.
           Far, far behind, the police are still coming.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SIMPSON HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          CHUCK AND RITA SIMPSON (50s) are eating Chinese food with
          their daughter, ROXANNE (20s) and Blaze. Roxanne is
          beautiful, easygoing. She's also seven months pregnant.
          The Simpsons are simple, working-class folk. Judging by the
          strained atmosphere, it's evident that they don't care too
          much for Blaze.

                         RITA

                         (TO CHUCK)
          Hon, would you pass me the vegetables.
          Chuck obliges, takes a drink of his beer, nods to Blaze.

                         CHUCK
          So how're things going at the shop, John?

                         BLAZE
          (scarfing down his food)
          Good, good.

                         CHUCK
          (not buying it)
          Yeah? Cause Mike says you've been
          slacking off, horsing around.

                         ROXANNE

                         (ALL SMILES)
          It's okay, Rox.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          S.

                         CONTINUED:
          Blaze sets his fork down, wipes his mouth with his napkin.
          Conjures up his best earnest look.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Truth is, Mr. Simpson, I've been thinking
          about clearing out of there. Maybe
          opening up a shop of my own --
          Roxanne raises an eyebrow at this. News to her.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          See, I've been saving up. You know, for
          the baby and all. And I--
          DOORBELL. Roxanne rises to get it.

                         CHUCK
          You were saying?

                         BLAZE
          (distracted, looking to the

                         DOOR)
           Right, so anyway --

           ROXANNE (O. S . )

                         JOHN --
          Blaze looks over. Two Sheriff's Deputies, LUCAS COLE and
          RICK GEORGE, are standing in the doorway. Roxanne looks
          pissed -- like this isn't the first time this has happened.
          Blaze stands, approaches. Clearly, he knows them both.

                         BLAZE
          (cocky, wary)
          Lucas. Rick.

                         COLE
          Johnny. We'd like you to come down the
          station.
          Their demeanor is hard. Won't take "no" for an answer.

                         BLAZE

                         (INSOLENT)
          Can I finish eating?
          Nope. Blaze squirms, feels Roxanne's eyes on him. He turns
          to her, tries to explain.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, hon. It's just routine --

                         ROXANNE

                         (TERSE)
          It is by now. Just let me know if you're
          staying overnight.
          She goes back to her dinner.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze enters. The apartment is dark- TV flickers. Roxanne
          is sleeping on the couch. On the coffee table: Chinese
          leftovers, fortune cookies.

                         BLAZE
          Hey.
          She's sound asleep. He crouches, touches her face.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          Hey.
          Roxanne barely stirs, deeply groggy.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Everything's cool.

                         ROXANNE

                         (SLURRED)
          You're going to jail.

                         BLAZE
          No. No. Everything's okay. Jed and
          Murph just got a little boisterous at The
          Prairie Dog last night. Cops wanted to
          read us the riot act, that's all --
          She yawns, curls up, starts to drift away again.

                         ROXANNE
          I was worried about you. And I don't
          like your friends.
          But Blaze won't let her go back to sleep. He jostles her.

                         BLAZE
          Listen, I want to show you something --

                         (CONTINUED)

                         ROXANNE
          I'm sure you do. But I'm half-asleep and
          you're an ass-hole.

                         BLAZE
          I'm serious, Rox. This is important.
          He drags her up off the couch. Makes her stand up. She
          MOANS, scowls, but he gets her on her feet.

                         ROXANNE
          John, I have to go to work tomorrow

                         BLAZE
          (offers her coat)
          Put your coat on. You'll be glad you
          did. Promise. It'll be an adventure. A
          mystery tour.

                         ROXANNE
          This better be good.
          She stomps to the bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals
          a fortune cookie from the left-overs, snaps it open --
          The fortune is blank. Both sides. He tosses it away.

                         CUT TO:

                         COYOTE EYES
          glittering black, watching.

           Alright, I'm here. Now what?

           EXT. DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

           Blaze and Roxanne creep through a hole in the outer fence,
          making their way to --

                         BLAZE
          Keep going. It's just up there.

          A BROKEN-DOWN CAROUSEL
          Must have been magnificent in its day.

                         ROXANNE

          You don't have to ride, just climb up.
          She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him.

                         ROXANNE
          You're going to have to grow up one day,
          Johnny Blaze.

                         BLAZE
          Not if I can help it.
          He follows her up onto the ride. She weaves through the
          wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this secret adventure.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Keep going, keep going --
          She comes around the other side, catches her breath. The
          whole valley is spread out before her -- a glorious scatter
          of diamonds on velvet.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Uh-oh.

                         ROXANNE

                         (TURNING BACK)
          What?

                         BLAZE
          Ever hear of a carnival wedding?
          Roxanne shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new
          dollar bill, folding it, making something.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          If a man and a woman walk around a
          carousel going backwards, they're
          considered hitched.

                         ROXANNE
          You made that up.

                         BLAZE
          Swear to God.
          He finishes folding the bill. The "one" is now neatly set on
          top of an ORIGAMI WEDDING BAND like a paper jewel.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          You want this?

          She nods, offering her hand. He slips the ring onto her
          finger and she examines it, lit up inside.

                         ROXANNE
          It's beautiful.
          He smiles at her joy, wrestles with what he's about to say.

                         BLAZE
          How'd I ever find you?

                         ROXANNE

                         (SHRUGGING)
          Fate?

                         BLAZE
          I don't believe in fate.

                         ROXANNE
          Maybe it believes in you.
          They hug each other fiercely. A long, soulful embrace.
          Blaze looks to the city lights beneath them once more.

          ROXANNE (CONT ' D)
          Here's the thing, John. We're having a
          baby. You can't keep acting like
          everything's a game. I need you with me.
          I need to know I'll be able to wake up in
          the morning and see your face next to
          mine. Not have to worry that you spent
          the night in jail.

                         (BEAT)
          That's not a life. At least not one I'm
          interested in living.

                         BLAZE
          I know. I'm gonna get my shit together.
          For Leal, this time,

                         (EARNEST)
          I promise you, Rox. I'll always be there
          for you.
          She takes his hand and places it on her belly.

                         ROXANNE
          Don't promise me, promise her.

                         THE COYOTE
          blinks. THUNDER from the next scene prelaps as we

          INT. BLAZE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          WHAM! Blaze enters, drenched from head to toe, frantic.
          Roxanne's arms are filled with laundry.

                         BLAZE
          We gotta go. Get your stuff together.

                         ROXANNE
          What happened? What's wrong?
          Roxanne follows Blaze into the bedroom.

                         ROXANNE (CONT'D)
          What did you do?

                         BLAZE
          I fucked up. The police are coming.
          Grab your things. We have to go.
          She sags, clearly been through this before. He tosses a
          suitcase onto the bed, looks back at her.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Just do it, Rox!

                         FOLLOWING BLAZE
          as he storms into the bathroom. Reaches behind the high
          cistern, retrieves a hidden HANDGUN. He jumps down. Tears
          the side panel off the old bath tub. There's a stack of FLAT
          BLACK BOXES hidden within. Blaze drags them out, drops one -
          It pops open, spilling UNCUT DIAMONDS all over the floor.
          Blaze CURSES, struggles to gather up the loot.

           ROXANNE (O.S.)
          Jesus, Johnny --

                         ON ROXANNE
          standing in the doorway. She sawit all.

          EXT. BLAZE'S APARTMENT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Rain hammers down. SIRENS whine. Blaze shoves Roxanne and
          the suitcase into a beat-up El Camino.

          INT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT

           Blaze climbs behind the wheel, guns the engine even before
           Roxanne has buckled in. He gnashes into reverse, grinds the
          car into a backwards spin --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           -- nearly clipping another car pulling in. He jumps the curb
          and races off into the rain --

          INT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT

          -- passing a POLICE CAR coming the other way. Roxanne
          glances at Blaze, angry and disappointed.
          Blaze struggles. The rain. The wipers. The fogging
          windshield. It's a bad time to be Johnny Blaze.

                         BLAZE
          Fuck.

          BLAZE'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR POV:
          The cop car is turning, heading back in their direction.

                         ROXANNE

                         JOHN --
          Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer leaps.

          EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

          The EL Camino screams through the rain, with the cop car in
          dogged pursuit. TWO MORE POLICE CARS fall in behind them.

          INT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT

          Blaze fights to keep it together. The road ahead is
          dangerously winding. Tires SQUEAL as he hauls a sketchy turn.
          Roxanne gasps, fearful, bracing herself. The police are
          gaining. FLASHING LIGHTS flood the interior.

                         ROXANNE
          Slow down, John --
           Another sketchy turn. Blaze spins the wheel, brakes, hard.
           Too hard. The car hydroplanes, finds purchase --

           ROXANNE (CONT ' D )

          SLOW DOWN!
          LIGHTNING flashes, and suddenly, there's a

                         COYOTE
          or, the road, right in their path.

                         CONTINUED:
          Blaze jerks the wheel. Roxanne SCREAMS. The car skids,
          slews off the road, CRASHES through a guard rail --
          It plunges down a washout, flips end over end, shedding glass
          and wreckage, finally SLAMMING to a dead stop at the bottom
          of a rocky arroyo.

          INSIDE THE EL CAMINO
          Blaze stirs, blood streaming down his face. The windshield
          is blown open. Rain pours in.

                         BLAZE
          Roxanne --?
           He struggles to free himself from his seat, SEES a torn seat
          belt hanging beside him -- the passenger seat mr)ty.

                          BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Roxanne?!

          EXT. ARROYO - NIGHT

          Blaze scrambles out through the broken windshield. Falls off
          the wreck onto the steep, muddy incline. He tries to stand,
          can barely manage to crawl.

                         BLAZE
          (terror seizing him)

          ROXANNE!!!

                         ON ROXANNE
          lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe dead. Blaze
          scrambles to her, rolls her over. He hauls her into his
          arms, SOBBING, the two of them covered in mud and glass and
          God knows what.

                         TROOPERS
          are coming down the incline, guns drawn, FLASHLIGHTS beaming.
          They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of Roxanne.

           BLAZE (O.S. ) (CONT'D)
           Let me see her! God-Dammit! I have a
          right to see her --

          Get your fucking hands off me!
          Lucas Cole, the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier,
          approaches. Blaze SEES him and calms down a little.

          BLAZE (CONY' D)
          Please. Just let me see her.
          Cole nods to his men, who ease up on Blaze. He guides Blaze
          over to an observation window --

                         THEIR POV
          Roxanne lays in a surgery bay, DOCTORS and NURSES milling
          around her.

           DOCTOR (O.S.)
          Mr. Blaze --?
          Blaze turns, SEES a nervous DOCTOR standing behind him.

                         BLAZE
          Is she going to make it?

                         DOCTOR
           (blinks, stutters)
          Mr. Blaze, I --

                         DOCTOR
          We don't know. She's critical. Her
          injuries are grave. There's a real
          chance she won't --

                         BLAZE
          What about the baby?
          The doctor hesitates, glances at Cole.

                         DOCTOR
          I'm so sorry. We did everything we
          could.
          Blaze's will shatters as the full realization of what he's
          done slams into him. Tears sting his cheeks. Cole gives him
          space. Whatever punishment awaits Blaze can't be any worse
          than the hell he's living through now.

          INT. ICU WARD - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON Roxanne, on life support, hooked up to an array of
          monitors. Sleeping Beauty, still as death. Blaze sits
          beside her bed. Handcuffed. Numb. Rain streams against a
          nearby window. Tree limbs tap against the glass, like ghosts
          scratching to get in.
          TWO STATE TROOPERS stand guard at a respectable distance,
          MURMURING to each other. Elsewhere --

                         BOOTS
          walk purposefully on linoleum. Passing bay after bay.
          Beyond the Troopers, SOMEONE is approaching, half seen
          through layers of glass.
          Blaze HEARS the footsteps, lifts his weary head. The shadow
          keeps coming, half-glimpsed between partitions as it draws near.

          THE ICU LIGHTS
          flicker and weaken as if some unseen force were sapping their
          intensity. Blaze glances at the machines. Still ticking --

          AMBROSE STARKE ( 60S)
          steps into view. Duster-coat. A wide-brimmed cowboy hat. A
          smiling stone face. Blue eyes flecked with silver grey. He
          steps between the Troopers. They keep talking, don't even
          seem to notice him.

                         STARKE
          You look like you could use some help.
          Blaze glances at the troopers. They're still completely
          unaware of Starke's presence. It's as if Starke and Blaze
          have somehow stepped a split-second sideways in time.
          The lights around them continue to dim. The second hand on
          the wall clock stops. An eerie, dreamlike moment -- the wind,
          the rain, the tree branches tapping against the window pane.

                         BLAZE

                         (LOST)
          She's dying.
          Starke nods, places a COIN in Blaze's palm.

                         STARKE
          If I could help her, would you be willing
          co make a deal?

                         CONTINUED:
          Blaze looks at the coin -- gleaming, golden, embossed with a
          soaring eagle on one side, a coyote on the obverse.

                         BLAZE
          What kind of deal?

                         STARKE
          She lives. You work for me.
          Something about Starke's eyes. Commanding and haunting at
          the same time.

                         BLAZE
          What kind of work?
          Starke just keeps smiling. Lays a comforting hand on Blaze's
          shoulder as we drift towards Roxanne's beeping EEG.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          When I was young, I was told that our
          souls wander while we sleep. Sometimes
          they get lost. Sometimes they never make
          it back --

          FADE TO BLACK:

          SUPER TITLE: "FIVE YEARS LATER"

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DUSK

          FADE IN on John Blaze as he switches on the light, looks in
          the mirror. Those five years of work have taken their toll.
          A haggard reflection gazes back at him, He stares. And
          stares. Right into his pain.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          -- but if they dQ return, they bring
          messages. And I guess thhat's how the
          dead speak to us -- in memories that may
          be dreams, and dreams that feel like
          memories.
           Blaze turns off the light.

          INT. SEVEN ELEVEN - DUSK

          The store is empty. The CLERK prices cigarette packs, eyes a
          suspicious Native American woman, NOMI (30s), as she loads a
          basket with basics. Nomi sets the basket down on the
          counter. The clerk starts scanning the bar codes.

          Just passing through?
          Nomi nods, uneasy. She glances over her shoulder, searches
           out her half-breed daughter --

          RAIN (8) ,
          who is sorting intently through a rack of cheap toys. The
          kid is quiet, soulful, old beyond her years.

          CLERK (CONT ` D )
          Where you headed?

                         CLERK
          (shrugging, defensive)
          Just asking.
          He keeps packing. But he knows she's trouble.

          RAIN (O.S.)
          I like this.
          Nomi turns, SEES Rain clutching a toy -- a glow-in-the-dark
          Halloween skeleton.

                         NOMI
          It's too much, baby. Put it back. I
          don't have enough money for that.
          Rain stares right at Nomi -- and brazenly slips the doll into
          her coat pocket. Nomi glances at the Clerk. He didn't notice.

          EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN/DEADFALL GAS STATION - DUSK

          It's pouring rain. Nomi and Rain hurry across the muddy lot
          towards a ratty pickup.

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          Yeah, I found her. Came back to be with
          her dying grandpappy.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT
          BILLY-RAY CARRIGAN (30s) paces under an tire bay awning,
          talking on a cell-phone. He's handsome, charming, but
          there's evil lurking within that slick exterior. A pencil-
          thin scar runs just under one eye.

                          CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
           Don't worry. She's got the kid with her.
           Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup. The
           pickup chokes to life, carves out of the lot. Carrigan nods

                         TO --
          -- LANDSDALE ( 40s), a stone-faced criminal, who motions to
           five other thugs lounging nearby -- FUSCO, ALBRIGHT,
           CHUDACOFF, LLOYD and ODELL.

                          CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          (listening, impatient)
          I remember the deal. Just make sure you
          bring the money.
          He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting
          nearby -- a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and
          Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan.
          Carrigan pulls a Glock from his waistband, chambers a round.

                         CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          Who wants to be a millionaire?
          Landsdale smiles back, an awful smile.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          Some people are born bad. That's just
          the way they come into the world.
          Something goes wrong. Something breaks
          inside of them --
          The trucks pull away, tires ploughing muddy tracks, passing
          two STRAY DOGS fighting over a bloody road-kill carcass.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - BEDROOM - DUSK

          Blaze sweeps aside a curtain, studies the slowly darkening
          landscape outside with tired resignation.

          WOMAN (V.0.)
          -- and they spend the rest of their lives
          trying to make up for it.

          PAN OVER Blaze's belongings on the bureau -- a duffle bag,
          old photographs of his previous life with Roxanne, a
          collection of blank postcards. Tucked amidst the photos is a
          sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child.

          Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it. The map is
          crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city,
          along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations. Blaze
          traces his finger down to his present location: DEADFALL.

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          A lonesome service road threads through bleak wild-grass
          prairie. Nomi's pickup appears on the horizon.

          INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - DUSK

          Nomi glances at Rain, who clutches her new skeleton toy.

                         NOMI
          Seatbelt.
          Rain dutifully fastens herself in.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Hey, bug. You hungry?
          Rain shakes her head-

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Want to listen to music?
          (off Rain's sullen shrug)
          Look, we won't have to keep moving around
          forever, okay? I'll figure something
          out. I promise.
          Rain looks at her mother. She's heard it all before-
          WHAM! Somebody rams the truck from behind. Rain SCREAMS.

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK

          Blaze reaches for a pack of cigarettes, lights a match. He
          stares at the match flame for a moment -- for the flame is
          behaving strangely, bending towards Blaze as if it were drawn
          -o T>; m. Blaze shakes out the match, then retrieves --

          THE COYOTE/EAGLE COIN
          He stares at it ruefully, then places it on the map and sets
          it spinning. We get the sense that this is a ritual he has
          performed many times before. As we MOVE IN on the coin --

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          CRASH! The Tundra rams Nomi's pickup again. Nomi fights to
          keep control. Aims for a turn-off up ahead. She hauls the
          truck into the turn, fights the roll-over, barely makes it --
          -- but it's not fast enough. The Tundra and the Bronco make
          the turn too. Their HEADLIGHTS blaze into the cab. Nomi
          floors the gas. The pickup judders. The road here is
          bumpier, cracked and pocked.
          The Bronco swings out, pulls up alongside Nomi. She glimpses
          Landsdale, LAUGHING, urging Carrigan on. Carrigan cuts
          right, SLAMS the Bronco into Nomi's side.

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK

          On Blaze, watching the coin with a growing sense of fatalism.
          Spinning. Spinning. But starting to slow now --

          EXT_ ROAD - DUSK
          WHAM! The Bronco collides with Nomi's door again. Glass
          shatters- Rain WAILS, terrified. Wind and rain rush in --
          BLOWOUT! Front offside tire. Nomi loses it, careens right,
          carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert, SMASHING over
          rocks, sagebrush, fence posts and barbed wire --
          After a few dozen tortured yards, the pickup shudders to a
          stop. The Bronco and the Tundra haul up nearby, engines
          CHUGGING like hungry beasts.

          IN THE PICKUP
          Nomi angrily drags her seatbelt off, snatches a revolver from
          the glove box. She looks to Rain:

                         NOMI
          Stay here. And lock the doors.
          Nomi climbs out into the rain, SLAMS the door. Rain works
          the locks, but the driver's side is all bent up and twisted --

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          Nomi approaches the trucks, blinded by halogen high-beams.
          SILHOUETTES are coming towards her. She raises the revolver --

                         NOMI
          Back the fuck off!
          LANDSDALE comes from left of nowhere, twists the gun from her
          hands in one unexpected move. She spins, SEES Carrigan
          approaching -- and recognizes him instantly.

           NOMI (CONY' D)
          Billy-Ray --?

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL -- DUSK

          On Blaze, watching the spinning coin. He shuts his eyes, as
          if he could stave off what he knows is coming next. As if he
          could contain the thing that is, even now, clawing its way
          into his body from some dark circle of hell.

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          CRACK! Nomi falls to her knees, dimly aware of her daughter
          SCREAMING. Carrigan stands over her, massaging his fist.

                         CARRIGAN
          Well, if it isn't Little Miss Running
          Bear.
          He grabs her by her hair, shoves the Glock beneath her chin.

                         CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          Gentlemen, you are looking at one of the
          finest pieces of ass I have ever had the
          good fortune of defiling.

                         NOMI
          Fuck you, Billy --

                         CARRIGAN
          Now I might just take you up on that,
          Nome. Old Billy-Ray's been getting a
          little tired shaking hands with the
          governor, know what I'm saying?

          IN THE PICKUP CAB
          Landsdale and his men are trying to get the doors open. Rain
          scoots to the driver's side, tries to start the engine. But
          the driver's door is wrenched open and the men are on her -

          Careful with her!
          Rain is dragged kicking and screaming from the cab.

          ON NOMI,
          struggling to free herself, desperate to help her child.

                         NOMI
          Leave her alone!
          Rain fights like a hellion, rakes her fingernails across
          Odell's face.

                         ODELL
          Fuck!
          SLAP! Landsdale back-hands the little girl. As she reels,
          he binds her hands with duct tape, then picks her up and
          throws into the Bronco.

                         NOMI

          YOU COCKSUCKERS!

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK

          The coin slows. Blaze opens his eyes, a look of dread
          washing over his face. He stares at his hands -- they're
          shaking, emitting a HEAT HAZE.

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          THUNDER explodes. LIGHTNING flashes. The men gather round
          to watch Carrigan beat Nomi unmercifully. He knocks her back
          into the mud. She tries to crawl away, blinded by the rain.

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - NIGHT

          The coin comes to a stop, coyote-side up.
          Blaze SCREAMS, his body wracked with pain. He begins to
          violently shake, his muscles twisting in unnatural
          contortions. With a combustive WHOOSH his face abruptly
          CATCHES FIRE and --

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          CRACK! SMACK! Carrigan delivers the coup-de-grace. Pistol
          whips Nomi with the Glock. Her head snaps back. Blood sprays
          in deep slow-motion, spatters the bronco's headlights --

          Nomi struggles backwards through rivulets of mud. Carrigan
          looms over her. All she can do is stare up at him, glassy
          and unfocused as rain spatters her face.

          Tell you what, Hon. You want your

          He aims the Glock at her face, about to pull the trigger as --

                         CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          You can fucking have it!
          -- a GUT-WRENCHING HOWL cuts through the night, echoing off
          the canyon walls. Carrigan and his cronies take a beat,
          staring through sheets of rain.
          Silence. Just the relentless downpour.

                         ODELL
          The hell was that?
          The men glance at each other, nervous. A THUNDER-QUAKE
          rumbles, so low and gritty it'll rattle your fillings.
          The men look around, frightened. Rocks fall from the
          surrounding butte. Odell looks down. The SOUND is deafening,
          vibra tine: the very earth. And that's when it happens:

          A FLAMING RED-HOT MONSTER-CYCLE
          leaps from atop a wedged outcrop, ridden by SOMETHING that
          SCREAMS and BURNS. Silent SLOW MOTION. Heat haze, glowing
          manifolds. The bike catches twenty feet of air, trailing
          fire like a comet's tail as it passes right over their
          disbelieving heads.
          What.
          The.
          Fuck.
          Touchdown. A BLAST-WAVE of heat and flame billow outward.
          The men shield themselves, stumbling backwards. The bike
          hauls a deep carving turn, peeling mud, slides to a dead
          stop, hissing in the driving rain.
          Time stands still. Carrigan and his men gape. The monster
          cycle throbs.

          Alive. Evil. Aflame. A man but not a man -- an impossible
          spectre, engulfed in fire, its skullish head deeply bowed.
          Clinking coils of red-hot chain slip link by link through its
          skeletal, flickering fingers. Then it lifts his terrible

                         HEAD --

          THE FACE OF JOHN BLAZE
          Skeletal, aflame, but somehow still Johnny, his tortured
          visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white.
          His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an INHUMAN HOWL, at once
          predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal damnation.
          Time speeds up again. The men run. The Ghost Rider
          accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat.
          Lloyd runs fast as he can. Talk about pointless. The Ghost
          Rider seizes his head, drags him seventy yards, burning him
          black, discarding him --
          The other men let rip. Guns blaze. BULLETS punch through the
          Ghost Rider, coming out his back as red hot slag. The demon
          hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his rear wheel --

                         ALBRIGHT
          What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?!
          Albright FIRES his shotgun. THUNDERING past like an Amtrak
          train, the Ghost Rider PUNCHES a flaming fist right through
          Albright'-, face.
          That's it for the others. They scramble for the trucks.
          WHOOSH! The Ghost Rider lashes out with his chains, lassos
          Chudacoff. He SCREAMS as the metal sears his body, falls
          heavily, burning --
          The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons something internal
          and lets it loose -- a blast of PURE HELLFIRE that courses
          down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him.
          The men make the trucks, pile in. Landsdale slams the Tundra
          into drive. The big truck hauls away.
          Carrigan fights to get the Bronco into gear. Rain peeks out

          suddenly we are --

          INSIDE THE BRONCO'S ENGINE
          A series of MACRO SHOTS as we move amongst the pistons,
          cylinders, and intake manifolds. The mixture of vaporized
          fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite, but then the
          miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon
          themselves and we are --

                         BACK OUTSIDE
          with Carrigan. His truck won't start. Somehow, the ?host
          Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine.
          The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers
          white-hot now, throbbing with heat. He slices through the
          Bronco's door like a human oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the
          vehicle apart.
          Carrigan panics, drags Rain out the passenger door. But
          Fusco is still trapped inside. Can't get his seatbelt off.
          The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the vehicle and
          HURLS the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted
          back seat. The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a
          skeletal claw --

                         FUSCO
          Oh God, please, I ain't nothing to do

          terrible SCREAMS. He looks back, wishes he hadn't --
           The Ghost Rider has Fusco snatched up nose-to-nose, forcing
          the man to look right into --

          THE GHOST RIDER'S EYES
          Hungry black sockets that suck the fire from the air.

          awful pits, fall into them, as grisly IMAGES from his evil
          past spark and shred into his melting mind.
          Every act of violence, every crime he ever committed --
          beatings, murders, acts of torture and revenge -- are now
          revisited upon Fusco tenfold. This is the PENANCE STARE, and
          Fusco is feeling it's full, hellish force. The Ghost Rider
          and Fusco SCREAM in sync.
          Carrigan and Rain can't look away. They stand transfixed --
          Then it's over. The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud.
          He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but
          still alive, his brain irrevocably overloaded.
          And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too. Immobile.
          Internal. Then he looks up, past Carrigan. R;rht at. Rain.
          Rain stares back. But it's --

                         BLAZE'S FACE
          she SEES. An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment.
          And Rain's terror is forgotten for just that moment, replaced
          with something best described as empathy.

          LIGHT AND NOISE
          to the Ghost Rider's left. He turns -- the Tundra screams
          out of nowhere, slamming into him at sixty plus.

          INSIDE THE CAB
          LANDSDALE ducks the shattering windshield, leaps from the
          truck as it fills with fire --
          The Tundra keeps moving, pile-drives the howling spectre
          square into a massive boulder. The truck compresses like an
          accordion, EXPLODES, engulfs the rock with fire --
          Landsdale picks himself up, ready for anything. Carrigan
          tugs Rain over. The wreckage burns out of control.

                         CARRIGAN

          Just then, Nomi's pickup backs into view. Odell is driving.
          Ca___gan snatches Rain up like baggage, starts forward.

          dazed, in a muddy gully. She scrambles up to the lip, SEES
          the burning Tundra nearby, SEES her pickup hauling away into
          the night. She WAILS, tries to drags herself to her feet --
          CREAK. The burning wreckage moves. Moves again. Nomi ducks
          down, watches, uncomprehending. The crumpled truck is hurled
          aside. Two tons. Tipped over like a packing crate.
          Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with fear. HEAVY
          FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near --
          Nomi dares to look up. The Ghost Rider stares down at her.
          Like Death itself. Imagine yourself face to face with a
          Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable force of nature --
          Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you. The world
          exhales. After a moment Nomi dares to look again:

          NOMI'S POV (THROUGH THE POURING RAIN)
          All she sees is a MAN, in tattered clothes, rolling a busted
          up motorcycle away into the darkness.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL - TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT

          Graveyard shift but the floor is busy. Too many accidents,
          too few staff. And the POLICE and PARAMEDICS hovering here
          and there are just getting in the way.

          ON BLAZE,
          stumbling through the crowded ward, head down, in obvious
          pain. OR. QUINLAN ( 30s, harried), struggles to keep up,
          filling out paperwork on the fly.

                         QUINLAN
          Sir, you have to tell me your name.

                         BLAZE
          I just need to sit down for a moment.
          And I need some forceps, gauze, tape --

                         QUINLAN
          I'll decide what you need, alright?
          Name?
          Blaze hauls a curtain aside, finds an empty surgery bay,
          prepped and ready to go.

          SHOUTING MEDICS tear past, pushing a SCREAMING BURN VICTIM on
          a gurney. Blaze ducks into the curtained bay. Quinlan
          follows.

                         QUINLAN (CONT'D)
          Sir, I can't help you if you don't
          cooperate.
          (beat, pointedly)
          Are you on something? Drugs?
          Blaze pulls at his jacket, easing it over his battered body.

                         BLAZE
          No, no. Do I look like troub-unghhh --
          He grimaces as the jacket comes off. Bullet wounds, shotgun
          damage, torn flesh, and a lot of BLOOD.

                         QUINLAN

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          Oh -- my. What happened to you?
          Blaze sits back on the bed, sets about cleaning his wounds
          with tools laid out on a tray nearby.

                         BLAZE
          Motorcycle accident. Couple abrasions,
          maybe some rib fractures --
          (Quinlan tries to help)
          Just step back, I'll handle it --

                         QUINLAN
          Those are bullet holes.
          Blaze cleans the wounds she's referring to, grits his teeth
          as he swabs gauze deep into his flesh.

                         BLAZE
          Nah. They're just -- gouges. Surface
          damage. They'll heal up fine. Ungh -
          do you have any -- painkillers?

                         QUINLAN
          (assertive now, plainly

                         SUSPICIOUS)
          This was no motorcycle accident.
          Somebody has cauterized your wounds
          Blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound.

                         BLAZE
          Percocet? Vicodin, maybe?

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Blaze pulls a vicious shard of metal out of his side, stifles
          a SCREAM, fights to keep it together.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          Just. Give. Me. Something. For. The.
          Pain.
          He staunches the blood, fixing her with such a stone stare
          that she involuntarily backs away.

                         QUINLAN
          I'm sorry -- but I need to report this.
          Stay right there.
          Quinlan backs out through the curtain. Blaze sighs, tapes a
          thick gauze patch over the wound, eyes hunting. He SEES a
          drug cabinet, breaks into it. Fills his pockets.

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Moments later, Blaze is stumbling away. He pops the cap of a
          pill bottle, dry-swallows a half-dozen painkillers --
          To his right, a PARAMEDIC TEAM works on the shrieking burn
          victim we saw earlier. Blaze stops, horrified --
          It's FUSCO, eyes rolling wildly, charred nearly beyond
          recognition. Flailing and convulsing, fingers nothing but
          exposed, blackened bone --

          ON BLAZE,
          backing into a quiet corner. He suppresses a sob, fumbling a
          hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine. He jabs the
          spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect.
          After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that
          he's leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned --

          A WANTED POSTER,
          helpfully illustrated with a mug-shot of Blaze's own face.
          Blaze tears the poster down, stuffs it in his pocket, then
          realizes that SOMEONE is watching him. He turns, SEES --

                         NOMI
          sitting on a nearby bed. Beaten, bruised, desolate. A PAIR
          OF STATE TROOPERS are questioning her. She stares past them,
          straight at Blaze. She recognizes him.

                         CONTINUED:
           Ice water floods Blaze's veins. He hurries away.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

          Blaze approaches a mailbox, fishes a postcard from his
          backpack. He writes the date, checks the time on his watch
          and jots that down too. He addresses it, drops it in the
          slot. Then he turns around and SEES --
          -- Nomi standing behin him, Jï¿½Iorkina his way.

                         NOMI
          You were there last night.

                         BLAZE
          Excuse me?

                         NOMI
          when they took my daughter.

                         BLAZE
          I don't know what you're talking about

                         NOMI
          Yes you do.
          Blaze tries to pass off his unease with an ill-conjured
          smile. He pushes past her, moving to his battered
          motorcycle. Nomi follows.

          NOMI (CONT' D )
          The Ghost Rider. It walked right past
          me. It let me live.
          (a whisper, intense)
          I know what you are.
          Blaze stares at Nomi, shaken.

                         BLAZE
          Lady, you don't know shit.
          (his tone turning lethal)
          Now bark the fuck o t of my Ii
          Blaze mounts his bike, kicks it alive, leaves Nomi in the
          dust.

          EXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY

          Blaze heads north under a big sky castled with towering white
          clouds.

          Prairie grasslands roll away on either side of the two lane
          blacktop. But Blaze's landscape is deep within and dark,
          dominated by the thunderheads of last night's horror.
          He notches the throttle up a little, cruises at ninety.
          Rolls his head back, lets the wind stream over his face.
          Then he hears ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE. Blaze looks back --

                         NOMI
          pulls alongside Blaze, riding a monster bike of her own.
          Blaze burns away. But Nomi's no slouch. She matches his
          speed and is back beside him moments later. She SHOUTS:

                         NOMI

          PULL OVER! I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!
          Blaze guns the bike again, jinks around an oncoming station
          wagon that blares it's HORN_ But Nomi's still on him --

          NOM I (CONT' D )

          DAMNIT, I NEED YOUR HELP!!!

                         BLAZE

                         (IRRITATED)

          LADY, I'VE HELPED YOU ENOUGH!
          Nomi smiles. Blaze just slipped up and they both know it.

                         NOMI

          I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST RIDER!!!
          Angry with himself, Blaze throttles his bike to the max,
          howling over the next rise on his back wheel, probably
          hitting one-fifteen as he vanishes from view.
          Nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits, her engine
          RUMBLING. Wind blows. Lizards click.
          After a long beat, Blaze reappears. Stops far away on the
          crest of the rise. Stares at her.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FOOTHILLS - DUSK

           Blaze and Nomi weave their way through an obstacle course of
           rusted car hulks and assorted junk, heading for a battered
           Airstream trailer perched on the edge of a bluff.

          Like what?

                         NOMI
          This thing that's riding you, the Ghost
          Rider. I guess it has a lot of names.
          But the one I grew up hearing was nagi
          ocanl sice. It means the Spirit of
          Vengeance.

                         BLAZE
          You actually believe what you're telling
          me?

          You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I
          can hear the mountains talking to each
          other. And I saw you light up those
          pricks like Chinese New Year last night.
          They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare.

          NOMI (CONT ' D )
          what do you see when you sleep at night?
          The dead? The faces of the people you've
          taken?

          Nomi nods, not sure she believes him. Enters the trailer.

          INT. AIRSTREAM - DUSK

          Dark, shadowy. Curtains drawn tightly shut. Every corner
          crammed with bric-a-brac. On the TV: the football game.
          Blaze sits on a collapsing couch. Nomi hovers nearby. Her
          grandfather HENRI LAFORTE (80s, emphysemic), rambles on in
          Dakotan, pausing only to suck on his oxygen mask. He keeps his
          eyes on the game the whole time, never once looking at Blaze.

                         BLAZE
          (aside, to Nomi)
          Does your grandfather understand English?

          He understands. He just refuses to speak
          it.
          Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts,
          impatient, finally sits forward.

                         BLAZE
          Listen, I don't want to be an ass-hole,
          but can we just fast-forward the whole
          Yoda routine?
          The home team scores! Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask,
          COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze stands. He's out of there.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Feel better, old man.

                         LAFORTE
          (rasping, in English)
          Give me the coin.
          Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze
          hands over the coin. Laforte studies it, starts speaking in
          Dakota again. Nomi translates:

                         NOMI
          The man you're looking for goes by lots
          of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota,
          he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at
          him straight on, you might see a human.
          Look at him out of the corner of your eye
          at one of the in-between times -- dusk or
          dawn, you might see something else.

                         BLAZE
          What does he want?

                         LAFORTE
          Wacokico. Vengeance.

                         BLAZE
          Why?

                         NOMI
          Because it's his nature.
          Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate.

          NOM I (CONT' D )
          Long ago, Coyote could change his shape,
          chop his body into little pieces, causing
          all sorts of mischief.

          But Eagle, he had a clear eye. And he
          saw Coyote for what he really was. So he
          swooped down, scattered those pieces to
          the winds.
          (beat, drawing a breath)
          The first men, they found the pieces, and
          not knowing what they were, they ate
          them. And that's, how all men came to
          have a little piece of Coyote in their
          hearts. Now Coyote, he'll promise
          anything to get those pieces back.
          There it is. Blaze exhales. He studies Laforte, those
          ancient, wise eyes.

                         BLAZE
          I've been looking for this man for five
          years now, storm-chasing --

          Tracked him halfway across the country.
          How do I make him lift the curse?

                         NOMI
          My grandfather says you've been looking
          in the wrong place. You need to look
          inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's
          weapon. An extension of his rage. But
          it can't ride people unless it has
          something to latch onto in the first
          place. You understand?
          Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back,
          returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to
          rise, Laforte says one final thing:

                         LAFORTE
          Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay?
          Nomi pauses, deciding how to phrase what the old man said.

                         BLAZE
          What? What'd he say?

          EXT. AIRSTREAM - NIGHT

          Darkness has fallen. The sky glitters infinite black. Blaze
          joins Nomi at the edge of the bluff.

                         BLAZE
          Why don't you just go to the police?

                         NOMI
          I did. But I'm red. They said they'll
          "look into it". Truth is, I've had a few
          run-ins with them myself.

                         BLAZE
          Your daughter -- why does Starke want her?
          Nomi takes a beat, looks away. Haunted, ashamed.

                         NOMI
          Because he's her father. And he wants
          her back. Billy-Ray and the others,
          they're being paid to take her to him.
          Blaze nods. Things are falling into place now.

          NOMI (CONT' D )
          Look, I believe things happen for a
          reason. Call it fate, karma, whatever
          you want -- but there's no way our paths
          crossing was just blind luck. I need
          your help, Blaze.

                         BLAZE
          Just so you understand what you're
          asking, this thing inside me -- I can't
          control it. It just comes out. And when
          it does, it's like I'm a prisoner in my
          own body. There's no reasoning with it.
          It doesn't have a conscience. It doesn't
          even have a personality. It's just a --

          -- hunger.

                         NOMI
          You're looking for Starke. I'm looking
          for my kid. We find one, we'll find the
          other.

                         BLAZE
          And then --?

                         CUT TO:

          A POWERFUL DUST STORM
          Raging full force. Blinding dust and debris batter closing
          store fronts. Roof sheeting tears away, street lamps rattle,
          hapless LOCALS struggle to get indoors.
          A lone coyote lopes through the havoc, trotting purposefully
          against the wind, dodging cars, ducking flying boards and
          planks. The animal passes under a sign: "HOWARDSVILLE CAR

          RENTS".

          CLOSE ON A MAN'S MOUTH
          Lupine. Carnivorous. Speaking into a payphone handset.

          Is she comfortable? Are you feeding her
          properly?

          She's alright, I guess. Quiet.

          BACK TO THE COYOTE
          running between rows of rental cars.

                         MAN
          Does she know where you're taking her?

                         VOICE
          I think she's figured it out.

                         MAN
          And how does she feel about that?

          How the hell should I know?

          EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAWN

          Carrigan paces the edge of a billowing wheatfield, wired to
          his cell phone. Dawn peeks over the horizon. In the
          distance, we SEE Landsdale and Odell waiting with Rain.

          I get her out of my sight, the better.

                         THE COYOTE
          approaches the phone booth situated beside the rental office.
          Inside the booth, the man is half-seen.

                         MAN
          She's the most important thing in your
          life, Carrigan. Make sure she arrives
          safely.

                         (BEAT)
          And be careful. She'll kill if she gets
          the chance.
           The man hangs up, turns to look at the coyote staring up at
          him. Once again, we meet --

                         AMBROSE STARKE
          Same sky-blue eyes flecked with metal. Starke and Coyote
          stare at each other, indifferent to the storm raging around
          them- He starts towards the rental office.

          INT. LONE STAR RENT-A-CAR - DAY

          Windows RATTLE. The storm HOWLS. A portly rental agent, JIM
          PETROWSKY, is closing up shop. He gathers his papers, turns
          out the lights. A TV on the counter is on:

                         WEATHERMAN
          -- experiencing extraordinary conditions.
          Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas,
          with reports of extensive damage and
          gusts of up to seventy miles per hour --
          As Pecrowsky turns off the TV, we hear the door CHIME.
          Starke enters, bringing a strong gust of wind with him.

                         PETROWSKY
          Sorry, guy, I'm just closing up.
          Starke looks to a clock on the wall -- it's 4:55.

                         STARKE
          According to the hours posted outside,
          you're still open.

          Look, Mister, in case you hadn't noticed,
          there's a storm coming -- tornadoes,
          whatever. I'm trying to get out of here.
          Starke fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze.

                         STARKE
          I would like to rent a car --
           (reading Petrowsky's name tag)
          -- "Jim" .
          Something in Starke's tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances
          to the window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the
          coyote out there, watching from across the way.

                         PETROWSKY

                         (RELENTING)
          Okay, alright, have a seat.
          Starke sits. Petrowsky moves behind his desk.

                          PETROWSKY (CONT'D)
          Now, Mr. --?

                         STARKE
          Starke. First name, Ambrose.

                         PETROWSKY
          (typing in the name)
          Starke, okay. What kind of car were you
          looking for?
          Starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various cars.

                         STARKE
          What about the Cadillac Deville? I
          noticed you had one in your lot outside.

                         PETROWSKY
           Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a
           full-size car? I can give you a Chevy
          Malibu, Ford Taurus --
          Starke deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow
          stronger. Petrowsky shifts in his seat, trying to mask his
          impatience. Were he observant enough, he might also notice
          that the wall clock has stopped.

          You want the Taurus? Give you a good
          deal, mid-size price. $37.99 a day,
          can't beat that.

                         STARKE
          I had my heart set on the Cadillac, Jim.

                         PETROWSKY

                         (ANNOYED NOW)
          Caddy's taken. Now look, I'm trying to
          be accommodating here, but I really am in
          a hurry. So what's it going to be?
          Another beat as Starke stares Petrowsky down. Gradually, the
          lights in the office begin to dim.

                         STARKE
          The Taurus, then.

                         PETROWSKY
          Great. Can I see a driver's license?
          Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license.
          Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore
          the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him.

          PETROWSKY (CONT' D )
          How many days do you need it for?

                         STARKE
          Two, three --

                         PETROWSKY
          Any other drivers?

          No.

                         PETROWSKY
          And you'll be paying by --?

                         STARKE
          Cash.

                         PETROWSKY
          I'll need a three hundred dollar deposit.
          Starke nods, removing a money clip from his jacket, deftly
          sliding out three crisp, brand-new hundred dollar bills.

          What about refueling?
          (off Starke' s look)
          We've got three options. You can
          purchase a full tank in advance, you can
          fill it up yourself before you return it,
          or you can have us do it, but then we
          have to charge you four dollars a gallon.
          Most people go for the tank in advance.
          Less hassle.

                         STARKE
          I'll do it myself.

                         PETROWSKY
          Okey-dokey.
          Petrowsky enters the final data, hits "PRINT". As the rental
          agreement begins feeding out, we hear a HORN FiONK.
          Starke turns. A mini-van has pulled up outside. A MOUSY
          WOMAN sits behind the wheel. A BOY sits in the back seat.
          The coyote is still there, but it pays no attention to them.

                         STARKE
          Mrs. Petrowsky?

                         PETROWSKY
          Yeah.
          Petrowsky slides the agreement to Starke, takes out a pen:

          PETROWSKY (CONT' D)
          Here you go. Just your standard rental
          agreement. You get up to 150 miles a day
          for free, twenty cents a mile after that.
          If you want additional personal accident
          insurance it's five dollars a day,
          another nine-ninety-nine if you want the
          loss/damage waiver. Your basic rental
          rate, plus applicable state and local
          tax. You just need to initial here,
          here, and here --
          (indicating various items)
          -- and give me your John Hancock on the
          line right here.
          Petrowsky offers Starke a pen. He doesn't take it. Instead,
          he pulls out a pair of bifocals. With agonizing slowness,
          Starke begins to peruse the rental agreement.

          PETROWSKY (CONT' D)
          Is there a o oblem --?

           The price you quoted was $37,99, the mid-
           size rate. But you've listed the daily
           rate here as $62.99.

                         PETROWSKY
          I did?
          Starke turns the agreement around for Petrowsky to see.

                         PETROWSKY (CONT'D)
          Geez, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.
          That's the Caddy rate. Guess I entered
          it in by mistake --
          Starke looks up at Petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals,
          the timbre of his voice taking on a decidedly frigid turn.

                         STARKE
          Were you trying to cheat me, Jim?

                         PETROWSKY
          No, no, not at all --

                         STARKE
          Then I'd like a new contract specifying
          the appropriate rate.
          Petrowsky squirms, uncomfortable. For in that pregnant
          moment, without either participant uttering at word, the
          entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed.

                         PETROWSKY
          Look, can't we just go with the contract
          we've got here? I'll make a note of it
          and knock a day's rental off the total
          when you return it. What do you say?

                         STARKE
          I say the Devil's in the details.

          EXT. LONE STAR RENT-A-CAR - DAY

          CRASH! Petrowsky flies through the plate glass window. He
          lands on the concrete, stunned, bleeding from multiple
          lacerations. He tries to sit up, but his right arm is
          broken, horribly mangled.

          Helen Petrowsky bolts from the mini-van. The boy watches as
          his mother rushes to her husband's side.

                         HELEN
          Jim?! Jim, what happened?!
          Petrowsky clutches at his wife's arm, trying to speak. A
          shard of glass has penetrated his larynx.

          Certain twists of that fate felt like
          nothing more than God's spite.

                         STARKE
          strides towards them, his face a veil of unmerciful contempt.
          The dust storm has taken on Biblical proportions, whipping
          and roiling around him, becoming an extension of his fury.
          He snatches Helen up by the throat, snapping her neck with
          inhuman strength, flings her lifeless body to the ground --
          then he brings his boot heel down on Petrowsky'shead.
          crushing it like an _aashell.

           WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          It was obvious to me that I'd done
          something wrong. Broken some secret rule
          known only to Him. And as such, would be
          punished for my sins --
          Starke turns now, regarding the mini-van. The boy is nowhere
          in sight. He approaches, looks inside. The boy has fled.

          EXT. RENTAL CAR LOT - DAY

          We are low on the ground, tracking with the terrified Boy as
          he squirms his way beneath the cars. He pauses, nervous.

          BOY'S POV (BENEATH CAR)

          appears, creeping along a parallel aisle. It pauses,
          lowering its snout, peering at the boy from afar.
          The Boy freezes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. He squirms around
          for a better view --

          BOY'S POV (BENEATH CAR)
          We SEE Starke's boot heels a few dozen yards away, gradually
          closing in on the car beneath which the Boy hides.
          The Boy shuts his eyes. The FOOTSTEPS draw closer, then
          stop. The Boy opens his eyes. Starke's hoots are just an
          arm's length away.

          WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          There's a world out there that's neither
          right nor wrong. Neither kind nor cruel.

          in all it's bliss and pain.

          A HUMMER races along a desolate stretch of highway, passing
          through an inhospitable landscape of buttes, mesas, and cacti.

          INT. HUMMER - DAWN

          Carrigan drives. Landsdale rides shotgun, dozing. Odell is
          in back with Rain, her hands tightly bound. She keeps to
          herself, clutching her skeleton doll, stares out at the
          passing landscape. Odell offers her a bag of chips.

                         ODELL
          Want some food, kid?
          Rain doesn't respond. Odell rustles the bag.

                         ODELL (CONT'D)
          C'mon. Eat a chip or something.

                         CARRIGAN
          She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up
          and get some sleep.

                         ODELL
          I can't sleep. Every time I close my
          eyes, I see the face of that thing, Lloyd

                         BURNING --

          Just put it out of your head.

          If I could put it out of my head, I
          wouldn't be awake now, would I?
          Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren landscape.

                         CARRIGAN
          Look out there, what do you see?

          Dick.

                         CARRIGAN
          That's right. Miles and miles of
          nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit
          running around in that nothing. How many
          people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten?
          Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn
          paper at the supermarket. You believe

          overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers.

          Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever --

                         ODELL
          This wasn't no freaking Bigfoot! You see
          what it did to Albright? Punched his
          head clean off!

                         CARRIGAN
          Look, I don't know what that thing was.
          All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt-
          load of money to deliver the kid to him.
          We were told we'd see things and we were
          told to look the other way. You want to
          cut out? I'll pull over right here.

                         LANDSDALE
          Keep your shirt on, B. We didn't come
          this far just to limp home with nothing.
          Right, Odell?
          Odell settles back into his seat, uneasy.

                         ODELL
          I guess. But I'd still like to know what
          that thing was.

           One hundred miles-per-hour plus. Whip around to SEE --

          BLAZE AND NOMI,
          riding their cycles. Up ahead is a postal truck. Blaze
          HONKS, waves to the DRIVER. He's got a postcard in his hand.
          He hands it to the driver through the open door, then
          decreases his speed, falling back alongside Nomi.
          As they scream over a hill, we SEE the White Buffalo Indian
          Casino and Lodge in the distance.

                         NOMI
          I don't like this. I spent the last six
          years trying to forget this place.

                         BLAZE
          You got any idea where Billy-Ray might be

          Then we should start with where he's been.

          INT. INDIAN CASINO - DAY

          A chiming CACOPHONY. Acres of penny slots and video poker.
          Roulette wheels CLATTERING. Blackjack tables spinning.
          Blaze and Nomi weave their way through the maze.

                         BLAZE
          Your husband used to work here?

                         NOMI
          Billy-Ray dealt blackjack, poker. Worked
          the casino circuit. We met in Vegas.
          Things kind of went downhill after that.

          RODENBURG (O.S.)
          Got a lot of nerve showing your face here

          Believe me, Vince, this is the last place
          I want to be. But we need to find Billy-
          Ray. He took Rain.

          You have a nice day now.

          But you must've talked to him. Do you
          know where he's headed? Just tell me
          that.

                         RODENBURG
          What am I? His babysitter? I don't know
          where he is, Nome, and if I did, I sure
          as hell wouldn't be telling you.
          (looking to the other guards)
          Show these two ass-holes to the door.

                         BLAZE
          Look, this is important. We're talking
          about a kidnapping.

                         RODENBURG
          (sizing Blaze up)
          We are? And who is ?

                         BLAZE
          I'm just a friend.

          Ri h t. Nomi tell you what a blue ribbon
          slut she was? Do anything to support
          that needle habit of hers. Truth, 'bout
          the only person that hasn't had her
          around here is me.
          Blaze steps forward now, angry, threatening.

                         BLAZE
          That's enough.

          Blaze moves, twists Rodenburg's arm like rope, wrenches his
          thumb backwards, SLAMS Rodenburg face-first into one of those
          Plexiglas booths where people dive for dollars.
          The goons pull their pieces. Blaze just ups the pain.

          The goons hesitate. CUSTOMERS stare. Blaze seethes.

                         BLAZE
          I need you to understand something,
          Vince. I am, by nature, an inherently
          violent man and there's not much in the
          way of bad that I haven't already
          inflicted on this miserable world --
          (applying even more pressure)
          So unless the idea of learning to drive a
          wheelchair with your mouth sounds
          appealing, I suggest you apologize to my
          friend and tell us WHERE THE FUCK BILLY-

          RAY IS HEADED!

          Blaze gives Rodenburg's thumb a savage twist.

          Arrrghh! H-he was -- ngh -- up at their
          old house, last night!

           And I'm sorry -- I'm fucking sorry!
           Blaze releases him. As the goons close in, Blaze deftly
          relieving Goon #1 of his handgun and turns it back on him.

                         BLAZE
          Think about it.
          The goons relent. Blaze and Nomi exit, leaving Rodenburg
          slumped on the floor, cradling his mangled hand.

          EXT. TRACT HOMES - DUSK

          A swath of cheap housing, part-finished, mostly abandoned,
          back-boning a steep bluff that overlooks the casino.
          Blaze and Nomi dismount their bikes. She stares at a
          particularly ramshackle house. Wind whips. Dead leaves
          blow. A rusting swing-set twists and creaks.

                         NOMI
          Never thought I'd be back here.
          They pass cautiously through the front yard. Nomi's pickup
          is parked nearby. The front door bangs back and forth. Nomi
          pulls a revolver from her waist-band.

                         BLAZE
          I think they're gone.
          Off Nomi's look, Blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Dual tracks. Looks like your old man
          switched to a Hummer.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - DUSK

          Window panes RATTLE. The lights don't work. Blaze and Nomi
          pick their way through food containers and discarded detritus.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Guess the boys camped out for a while.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          Dead leaves twirling. One whole side of the room is burned
          open, blackened and charred, the remaining timbers sealed
          with plastic sheeting. Nomi opens a drawer, rifles through
          singed papers -- finds an old PHOTO of her and Carrigan.

                         NOMI
          Listen, those things Vince said --

                         BLAZE
          You don't have to explain yourself to me.

                         NOMI
          Some of them are true.

                         BLAZE
          Doesn't make you a bad person.

          Nomi nods, but she's clearly agitated. Blaze crouches,
          traces his fingers over a stain on the wall. He can FEEL
          something. He shuts his eyes, opens them --

          BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST)
          The room, many years earlier. Carrigan backhands Nomi across
          the face. The silent moment is caught in motion so slow it's
          virtually a tableau.

          BACK TO THE PRESENT

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          He used to hit you.
          A statement, not a question. She nods.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Nomi is reluctant to enter. Blaze is inside, SEES her
          hesitation -- she's staring at the bed.

                         NOMI
          You can see the past?

                         BLAZE
          Just echoes, sometimes.

                         (BEAT)
          Tell me about Starke.
          Nomi hesitates, not wanting to relive this.

                         NOMI
          I was dying. I'd shot myself full of
          Billy's best gear. Figured I'd teach him
          a lesson and go out in style.
           Blaze nods, but he doesn't see Nomi now. He SEES --

          BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST)
          -- Nomi as she waS. An inch away from eternity. She is
          lying on the bed, staring upwards, shallow breaths- Above
          her, a MOTH flutters by a light, casting distorted shadows.

          BLAZE (V.O.)
          But it felt like a mistake.

          NOMI ON THE BED

          The lights begin to dim. We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching,
          muted and distorted, A SHADOW falls across Nomi --

                         STARKE
          stands above her. There are OTHER SHADOWS drifting in behind
          him. Things better left half-glimpsed. Coyotes. Beasts.

          NOMI (V.O.)
          He smiled and said --
          As Starke starts to speak, we hear:

                         BLAZE'S VOICE
          "You look like --

          Blaze finishing the phrase, knowing the punch-line too well.

                         BLAZE
          -- you could use some help."
          Nomi nods, hugs herself.

                         NOMI
          And I took it. What else was I going to
          do? I don't know what happened after
          that. I'm not sure I ever want to --
          (beat, struggling)
          All I know is, nine months later, Rain
          was born.

                         FLASHBACK IMAGES
          Silent, disjointed. The moth. Nomi's face, terror-stricken.
          Starke, eyes alight with malice and mischief.

          BACK TO THE PRESENT
          Nomi turns away, trying to banish the memory.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Billy-Ray hated her from the moment she
          was born. He knew she wasn't his, knew
          she was different --
          (re: the charred timbers)
          If I didn't leave he would've killed us
          both.

          Setting the house ablaze.

          BACK TO THE PRESENT
          Nomi pulls out a cigarette, nervously lights it.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Been running ever since. In my heart, I
          guess I knew Starke would be coming for
          her one day.

                         BLAZE
          Why send Billy-Ray after you?

                         NOMI
          Sick irony, I guess. Billy certainly
          knew all my haunts --
          (shaking her head)
          This was a mistake, Blaze. We're not
          going to find anything here.
          Blaze glances down -- a HEAT HAZE has engulfed his hand. He
          clenches his fist, looks up --

                         BLAZE
          Guess again.
          -- as HEADLIGHTS shine through one of the windows.
          Somebody's driving up to the house.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi creep towards the front door. A handful of
          vehicles are pulling up out front. The men disembark. It's
          Rodenburg, finger splinted, packing heat. He's returned with
          reinforcements: OSWALT, DOYLE, WEINGROD and PENNEBAKER.
          Blaze and Nomi make their way to the laundry room and the
          rear entrance -- but Doyle and Oswalt have already circled
          around back.

                         NOMI

                         (WHISPERING)
          Shit, they've got us trapped here.

          No. they're the one who are rang d.

          What're you --?

           -- and steps out to meet their tormentors. Rodenburg and the
           others are there now too. Rodenburg is grinning.

                          RODENBURG
           Talked-to Billy-Ray, chief. Don't know
           who you a r - e, but you picked the wrong --
          Blaze struggles to contain the Ghost Rider, but his whole
          body is drenched in sweat now -- like he's going to
          spontaneously combust at any moment.

                         BLAZE
          Please. Just tell us where they went and
          leave. There's no reason why you have to
          die.
          Rodenburg LAUGHS, looks at his friends in disbelief.

                         RODENBURG
          I'm gonna die? Me? Buddy, you got your
          head screwed on bass-ackwards!
          Rodenburg FIRES into Blaze's chest -- once, twice. Blaze
          stumbles back against the porch. As he falls, Rodenburg
          mounts the steps, charging in after Nomi.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Nomi runs -- but Weingrod DIVES through the plastic sheeting
          in the hall, cutting her off. He SLAMS her against the wall,
          twisting her arm behind her back.
          Rodenburg appears behind them. Together, he and Pennebaker
          drag Nomi towards the bedroom. They shove Nomi onto the bed.

                         RODENBURG
          Had to come back here, didn't you, Nomi?
          Just couldn't leave well enough alone.
          Nomi struggles to sit up. Rodenburg LAUGHS viciously, forces
          her back, drags at her jeans.

          sits up. He looks to Doyle, TEARS OF FIRE streaming from his
          eyes. As he stands, his chest wounds ignites, the flames
          instantly cauterizing the flesh. He's suddenly engulfed in a
          heat haze. Wood smolders all around him.
          Doyle backs away, terrified. He FIRES his gun again and
          again, but the bullets just punch through Blaze, creating
          more flaming holes-

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rodenburg stops mid-assault. Nomi breathes fearfully, held
           down at gunpoint by Pennebaker. We hear SCREAMS, the
           WHISTLING WIND, the CRACKLE OF FIRE.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

           Doyle rushes in from the porch, looks back --
          Blaze keeps on coming, unstoppable. He steps/burns his way
          through the screen door, leaves a trail of BURNING FOOTPRINTS
          in his wake. As he walks down the hall, the heat streaming
          off of him blisters and curls the wallpaper.
          Doyle backs away, stumbles -- and Blaze is upon him, lifting
          Doyle up, gripping him by the throat.

                         DOYLE

                         P-PLEASE --

                         BLAZE
          I'm sorry.
          soul, the fire expanding, engulfing Doyle.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Rodenburg buckles his pants, goes to the doorway, peers
          cautiously into the passage beyond.

                         RODENBURG'S POV:
          Flaming leaves burn and twirl at the far end. Firelight
          flickers. The SCREAMS still come, sporadic and terrible.
          Rodenburg's mind is racing. He motions to Pennebaker, who
          drags Nomi off the bed and strong-arms her to the door.

          Rodenburg leads, gun ready.

                         RODENBURG
          Doyle?
          Smoke and CRACKLING NOISES are building rapidly. The SHRIEKS
          persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere. Then --
          --- movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead
          but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting,
          fearful, eyes darting. He speaks in a strained whisper.

                         WEINGROD
          What's going on, man? Where's Oswalt?
          GUNFIRE! Outside! CRASH! Something hits the house. Then
          more SCREAMS, more GUNFIRE, and a RUMBLE so deep it's deadly.
          Pennebaker panics, pushing past Rodenburg.

                         PENNEBAKER
          I want out of here, I'm getting out!

                         RODENBURG
          Keep your fucking voices down!

                         WEINGROD
          He's burning the house, man! He's

                         BURNING THE--
          RED-HOT CHAINS whip viciously around Weingrod's head and
          torso. Then he's wrenched backwards, hauled straight through
          the plastic sheeting --

          THE GHOST RIDER
           bursts through the melting plastic, hauls his red-hot monster
          bike up on its back wheel --
          Rodenburg and Pennebaker run for their lives, falling into
          the fire-lit passage. The Ghost Rider screeches across the
          living room, setting the place aflame as he passes through.
          Nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where she was, SEES
          the fiery monster crash straight through the wall --
           Rodenburg and Pennebaker run through the flames, stumbling
          over Doyle's charred body --

          EXT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          They burst out the front door, clothes alight, racing across
          the yard towards their vehicles. Rodenburg looks back --
          The Ghost Rider EXPLODES through the front of the house,
          skids to a halt, flicks out a chain -- and snags Rode burgs
          ankle. He falls, SCREAMING. The chain retracts --
           Pennebaker reaches his vehicle, struggles with the door -
           TheGhost Rider thrusts a clawed hand outwards,clenchesthe
          air and hauls it back in. Like an explosion in reverse, 4,11
          fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being.
          A frozen moment. All terrified eyes on the Ghost Rider
          Then he lets rip. Hurls the energy back out as a torus of
          white hot fire that expands across the yard, BLASTS
          Rodenburg's shirt from his back, SMASHES Pennebaker against
          his vehicle --
          The vehicles EXPLODE, gas tanks rupturing. Pennebaker is
          blown to pieces. Rodenburg SCREAMS, shields his face. Fire
          and debris rain down in every direction. The Ghost Rider
          looms over him. More accurately, it's --

                         GHOST BLAZE
          Half man, half monster, his pitiless skull-face hazing and
          flickering between human and inhuman states.

                         GHOST BLAZE
          Where are they taking the girl?
          Rodenburg whimpers. Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg's hair,
          wrenches his head back.

          GHOST BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Where. Are_ They. Taking. Her?

                         RODENBURG

                         (BEYOND TERRIFIED)
          North! They're headed North, into
          Oregon, oh, god, fuck --

                         GHOST BLAZE
          Where?

                         RODENBURG

          Blue-white fire floods down Blaze's arm and engulfs
          Rodenburg. The poor man screams, struggles to break free --
          aze simply crrows Otte ana ac
          and the Ghost
          Rider's evil countenance submerges every trace of Blaze's
          humanity.
          Then it's over. The flames evaporate. Rodenburg's corpse
          crumbles to dust. Wind HOWLS. The Ghost Rider is gone.

                         ON BLAZE
          He SEES the corpses, the burning vehicles, tries to deny the
          horror. But it's always the same -- another swath of
          destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity.

                         NOMI
          He told you everything he knew.
          She's ten yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Told you everything --

                         (BEAT)
          -- you didn't have to do that.

                         BLAZE
          You asked for my help. I warned you what
          you were getting into.
          More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE SIRENS on
          the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

          A sub-par motel 6. Nomi's battered pickup is parked outside.
          We HEAR Blaze's tortured MOANS coming from within.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze sits in a chair, shirt off, Nomi at his side. She's
          trying to help him patch up his wounds, but the enormity of
          the damage and the sheer amount of blood is daunting.

                         NOMI

          -- wounds'11 be healed by morning.
          Nomi stands, still shaken. She retrieves a cigarette from
          her purse, lights it.

                         NOMI
          I thought you were dead.

          (considering his wounds)
          I don't even know if it's that's an

          I feel myself being dragged back --
          (breathing through the pain)
          --it's like being born all over again.
          Like every law in the universe is being
          broken.
          Blaze sits forward, gritting his teeth against the pain.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          See, the Ghost Rider -- it's drawn to
          darkness like a bloodhound. If it thinks
          you've sinned, it'll find you.

                         NOMI
          What if you're innocent?

                         BLAZE
          Nobody's innocent.

          Think about it. Everyone's done
          somethincr. You. Me --
           Blaze lifts up the coyote coin, flipping it over his fingers.

                          BLAZE (CONT'D)
           Every night I spin this fucking coin --
          and it always lands the same side up. I
          keep thinking -- ona time, one time I'm
          going to spin it and I'll see the other
          face. Sleep through the night without
          getting blood on my hands. But it never
          happens.

                         (SHAKING)

          Blaze flings the coin away in disgust. It spins, wobbles,

          lost, suddenly overcome with emotion.

          I'm just so fucking tired --
          Nomi moves to his side, struggles to help him up.

                         NOMI
          Here, why don't you lie down for a little
          while?
          Blaze nods, too tired to argue. Nomi half carries him to the
          bed, lowers him down. Blaze settles back, exhausted. Nomi
          watches him, holding vigil. His eyes grow heavy. He shuts
          them a moment, opens them again --

                         THE PAST
          -- and it's Roxanne who is laying beside him now. She rolls
          over to face him, smiles sleepily. Blaze reaches for her,
          touches her face -- and the moment shatters into violence.

          A COLLISION OF IMAGES
          -- the El Camino sliding, spinning over. Metal rending.
          -- rain pattering on broken, bloody wreckage. Roxanne's torn
          seat belt hanging loosely.
          -- climbing out through the blown-out windshield. Crawling
          in mud, Blaze's face reflected in broken glass.
          -- cradling Roxanne's body in his arms, rocking her and --

                         THE PRESENT
          WHAM! Blaze bolts up in bed, disoriented, shaken. Clearly,
          some time has passed.
          Nomi sits across the room now, holding Blaze's tattered
          photographs in her hands, looking a little guilty. She's got
          the paper wedding band which Blaze made for Roxanne too.'

                         BLAZE
          What are you doing?

                         NOMI

          As Blaze stands, we SEE that his wounds have healed.-He
          shrugs on a shirt, approaches. Nomi nods to the paper
          wedding band.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          You must've loved her a lot.
          Blaze doesn't answer. Just takes the photos and wedding band
          from her, shoves them back in his pack. He pulls out one of
          the postcards, scribbles an address on it.

                         BLAZE
          What time is it?

                         NOMI
          A little after three.

                         BLAZE
          What time, exactly?

                         NOMI
          3:27. Why?
          Blaze ignores her, jots down the time. Licks a stamp and
          puts it on the postcard. Leaves it on the dresser.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          What is it with you and those postcards,
          anyway?

                         BLAZE
          They're just a kind of record.
          (hauling up his pack)
          Let's go.

          INT. PICKUP - DRIVING - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi drive. Outside, the landscape passes, bugs
          twirling and spattering against the windshield like
          snowflakes.

                         MEMORY FLASHES
          Roxanne in the hospital, serene and beautiful. Starke
          handing Blaze the coin.

                         NOMI
          You made a deal.
          Blaze nods.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          So what happened? Did she live?

          Roxanne? Yeah, she's alive. She just
          doesn't know it.
          (off Nomi' s look)
          Coma. Probably never wake up.

                         NOMI
          So he tricked you.

                         BLAZE
          (a tired laugh)
          That's what he does, doesn't he?
          She nods. That's what he does.

                         NOMI
          (almost afraid to ask)
          What about the baby?
          Blaze just shakes his head.

                         BLAZE
          It's funny. That kid was supposed to be
          my second chance. Rox and I used to talk
          about it -- how things'd be different
          after she was born.
          Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability.

                         NOMI
          Maybe that's why we have them

                         BLAZE
          What, kids?

                         (NODDING)
          So we can make amends for all the royal
          fuck-ups we've perpetrated on the world.
          God knows I've had my share.
          (beat, pained)
          I just don't want her to have to pay for
          the things I've done. You know?
          Blaze nods. He knows all too well. He and Nomi drive on in
          silence for a beat, their thoughts turning inwards.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Can I ask you something? Honestly?
          (off Blaze's nod)

          I don't know. How do you beat the Devil?
          Walk up and bitch-slap him? Pretend
          you're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka
          up his hind ass? I'm basically making
          this up as I go along.
          Nomi smiles.

                         NOMI
          I'm sure you'll figure something out.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

          -- Rain looking out through the truck's moon roof, watching
          stars passing overhead. As the sky above slowly brightens in
          time-lapse, Rain's eyes grow lidded. She sleeps, clutching
          her skeleton toy and --

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - DAY

          -- waking sunlight floods the cabin. New shift. Odell
          drives. Rain rides shotgun. Carrigan and Landsdale are
          sacked out in back. The radio drones, laced with STATIC.
          Tedium. No one slept well. Carrigan stares out at the
          passing plains, expertly cutting a deck of cards one-handed.
          He SEES a scarecrow go by, standing ragged in the middle of
          nowhere. Then his cell phone RINGS. Carrigan flips it open --

                         CARRIGAN
          Yeah?
          Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He
          sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow.

                          CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
           Rodenburg's dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all
           those other inbred losers too.

           Looks like my ex-bitch has hooked up with
          the fire guy --
           In the rear-view mirror, Odell's eyes grow wide.

                          ODELL
          No fucking way --

                         LANDSDALE
          I know a guy. Got some boys given over

          RAIN (0.5.)
          He'll find me, you know.

          So shut your goddamn mouth --

          You can't tell me what to do. You're not
          my father.
          Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan
          settles back, but he's pissed.

                         CARRIGAN
          You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm
          just the dumb-ass that financed your
          whole fucking life. You and your mother
          both. And what did I get for that
          selfless act of stupidity? She burned
          down the house and gave me something to
          remember her by.
          He's referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away.
          Huddles against the door.

          She's not listening. Her bound hands are secretly pushed
          down into the tight gap between the seat and the door.

          ON RAIN'S FINGERS
          extending towards A PEN, one inch out of reach, caught
          between the seat mechanism and the door sill.

                         RAIN'S EYES
          are fluttering. Extreme concentration.

                         THE PEN
          levitates, tilts into her outstretched hands.
          The RADIO squeals painfully, pure strident STATIC. Odell
          punches a new station, but the STATIC continues, grows --
          Rain ATTACKS, stabbing the pen into Odell's thigh. He
          SCREAMS, slams the brakes, loses control of the truck --

          EXT. HIGHWAY/CORNFIELD - DAY

          The Hummer barrels off the road, SLAMS down hard into a
          concrete culvert. Without missing a beat, Rain is out and
          away, plunging into the cornfield. Carrigan and Landsdale
          bolt after her, guns drawn --

          ON RAIN,
          weaving between the stalks. She reaches an old farm
          implement, uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her
          taped bindings. Then she's up again, running --

          ON CARRIGAN AND LANDSDALE
          searching high and low. Carrigan SEES movement to his right,
          surges forward --
          -- but Rain jigs left and Carrigan misses her, tripping over
          the farm implement instead. He cuts himself, curses --
          Rain continues, straight ahead now. Carrigan motions to
          Landsdale. The two split up, drifting in different
          directions. They're gaining on her --

          BACK TO RAIN,
          losing ground. She spies a rock, scoops it up -- and SMASHES
          across C rr_gan's Face!

          Carrigan falls, dropping the gun. He searches for it,
          desperate. Then he SEES it. But as he reaches for it --
          -- Rain extends her hand, concentrating, eyes fluttering --
          WHOOSH! The gun spins away from Carrigan, into Rain's hands.
          She doesn't hesitate for a second -BLAM!-
           First shot wings Carrigan, knocks Rain on her ass. Carrigan
           DIVES for cover.. She FIRES wildly --CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-- but
          then the gun is spent and --
          -- Landsdale emerges through the corn, bagging Rain with his
          coat. As a shaken Carrigan gets to his feet, Landsdale slips
          his belt out of his pants and binds Rain tightly.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          Carrigan and Landsdale return to the Hummer, which is still
          nose down in the culvert. Landsdale carries Rain under his
          arm, tightly wrapped, no longer struggling.
          Odell sits on the hood, daubing the bloody wound in his leg
          with a handkerchief. He SEES Carrigan's wound.

                         ODELL
          Man, she shot you?

          Carrigan fumes, glances at Rain -- then he just snaps, starts
          angrily kicking at the door. After a few futile moments, he
          stops, paces, looks to Landsdale.

          and machinery -- a shut-down ROCK QUARRY in the distance.

          EXT. QUARRY - FRONT GATE - DAY

          From a distance, we watch as Landsdale approaches a
          guardhouse with an empty gas can. A GUARD opens the electric
          gate, steps out to help. Landsdale pistol-whips him, drags
          his limp body in through the gate.

          INT_ QUARRY OFFICE - DUSK
          The Guard slouches in a corner, bound and gagged. Landsdale
          and Odell lounge nearby, keeping a watchful eye on Rain.
          Carrigan paces by a window, nervously cutting his deck of
          cards one-handed. He's watching the shadows lengthen
          outside, the setting sun. He looks to Rain, who matches his
          gaze -- creepy eyes penetrating his brain.

                         CARRIGAN
          (to Landsdale, anxious)

          Don't worry. They're on their way.

          The abandoned Hummer in the culvert. A gang of CROWS tear a

          After a time, Nomi's pickup comes racing past. Blaze is
          driving, cranes to see the passing wreck. He pulls over onto
          the shoulder. Blaze and Nomi climb out, approach the
          vehicle.
          Nomi shines a flashlight, SEES blood on the front seat. She
          GASPS. Blaze reaches past her, touches the blood stain --

          FLASH OF THE PAST
          Chaotic and violent. Rain attacking Odell. The Hummer

          as Blaze steps away from the Hummer, into the field.

                         BLAZE
          She's alive.

                         NOMI
          How do you know ---?
          But Blaze isn't listening. His gaze is now fixated on the
          distant lights of the rock quarry.

          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi crest a rise in the field, hunker down:

                         THEIR POV:
          We can see the main compound of the quarry from here.
          Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the guardhouse.

                         NOMI
          You think she's in there?
          Blaze nods.

                          NOMI (CONT'D)
          Then let's go --
          Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back.

                         BLAZE
          No. We'll wait.

                         (POINTEDLY)
          Dawn's less than an hour away.

                         NOMI
          (taking out her gun)
          You wait. I'm heading in.

                         BLAZE
          Look, they're not going anywhere.

                         NOMI
          You don't know that. This is probably
          the best chance we'll get. They're
          sitting ducks. We can do this if you --

                         BLAZE
          If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their
          spirits?

                         (DRAWING CLOSER)

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         67

                         CONTINUED:

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          You still get it, do you? The Ghost
          Rider whales on whoever's got it coming,
          but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to
          remember their faces. And I Lb remember
          them. Every last one.
          Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES.
          Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up
          the service road on ratted-out Harleys.

                         NOMI
          They know we're coming, don't they?
          Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          I'm going in. You with me or not?

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          Landsdale opens the main gate. The bikers THUNDER into the
          compound -- low-rent Hell's Angel types culled form the
          shallow end of the gene pool known as the Gray Gargoyles.
          ARLO SKINNER, the Gargoyle's CEO, climbs off his hog, adjusts
          his nut-sack. As he approaches Landsdale. GUNT and CHESTER
          PULSIFER, his identical twin lieutenants, fall in behind.

                         ARLO
          Brotherman.

                         LANDSDALE
          Arlo.

                         ARLO

                         (GRINNING)
          I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers,
          Chester and Gunt?

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi scramble over a fence, then drop down, crouch-
          running to avoid a security camera. They hug the shadows.
          At least a dozen of the Gargoyles are in view, lounging
          around, shooting the shit.

                         BLAZE
          I'll find her. You stay here.
          Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         CONTINUED:

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          If things go South and the Ghost Rider
          takes over, I can't guarantee he won't --

                         NOMI
          I know. I'm on my own.
          (beat, more plaintive now)
          , Just bring her back to me. That's all I
          care about.

                         BLAZE

                         (NODDING)
          Start disabling the bikes. Last thing we
          need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks
          on our tail. Rip out all the coil wires ---
          Blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him. Nomi rolls her
          eyes and pulls out a switchblade, deftly slicing through a
          fuel line. Gasoline leaks onto the ground.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)

                         (CHAGRINED)
          -- or you could do that.
          As Blaze creeps away:

                         NOMI

                         BLAZE --
          (as he turns back)
          Whatever happens --

                         BLAZE
          You're welcome.
          Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes.

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo enters, accompanied by the Pulsifer Brothers. Carrigan
          and Landsdale are waiting to meet them.

                         ARLO
          So you need some contract work?

                         CARRIGAN
          An escort. We're making a delivery first
          thing tomorrow morning.

                         ARLO
          And will there be mayhem involved?

                         CARRIGAN
          Yeah, I'd say a certain amount of hijinx
          are likely to ensue.

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Blaze moves around the back of the compound. Up ahead, TWO
          GARGOYLES are lingering by a side entrance.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo takes out a nail clipper, starts trimming his fingernails.

                         ARLO
          Well, I'll tell you, I got nineteen
          brothers out there willing to go the
          distance and enough firepower to give a
          small Balkan nation a fucking titty-
          twister. But we don't come cheap. So
          how many men we going up against?

                         CARRIGAN
          One.

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          WHACK! Blaze elbows Gargoyle #2 in the face. As the biker
          drops, we SEE that Blaze has already disabled Gargoyle #1.
          Blaze quietly slips in through the door.

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          Nomi has worked her way through a half-dozen bikes now and a
          fair amount of gasoline has pooled on the ground around her.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo looks at Carrigan, incredulous.

                         ARLO
          One man?

                         CARRIGAN
          One man.

                         ARLO
          You trying to diddle my nutpurse, Mister?

                         CARRIGAN
          Absolutely not. Lemme clarify things --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Blaze sidles down the hallway, moving as quietly as he can.
          We can HEAR the men talking in the office just next door.

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          See, this guy's not really a "guy". He's
          more like a demon or something.

          ARLO (0. S.)
          A demon?

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          That's right.

          ARLO (O.S.)
          What, exactly, do you mean by demon?
          Blaze winces, lifting a hand before his face -- BLUE FLAMES
          dance over his fingertips. He leans against the wall for
          support. When he removes his hand, he leaves a singed palm-
          print on the drywall.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo puts the clipper away, starts arranging the fingernails
          on the desk before him into a neat little pile.

                         CARRIGAN
          Like his head's on fire and shit.
          Arlo LAUGHS, the Pulsifers follow suit. Then Arlo turns to
          Landsdale, icy now.

                         ARLO
          Brotherman, what in fuck's name is this
          smooth faggot talking about?

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Blaze exhales a wisp of BLUE FLAME, totally enveloped in a
          bubble of heat. More than anything, he wants to step inside,
          fully aflame. But he forces himself to simply take a peek --

                         BLAZE'S POV;
          The room, the men -- but no Rain.

                         LANDS DALE
          He's telling the truth, Arlo. The guy
          ain't human. Saw him torch Albright and
          Chudacoff with my own eyes.

          BACK IN CORRIDOR
          Blaze presses against the wall, desperately trying to rein
          the Ghost Rider in -- but FOOTSTEPS are coming. A Gargoyle
          is round; c the corner!

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Gunt rips open his shirt, shows a chest covered in tattoos.

                         GUNT
          Well, I say bring him on. You see this
          ink? That's a hundred hours under the
          needle. A motherfucking canvas of pain.
          He and Chester here, we're not afraid of
          fuck-diddly!

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          The Gargoyle passes the doorway, lights up a smoke. Or tries
          to. The flame from his Zippo is bending sideways. He tries
          a couple more times. Same thing. Weird.

                         ON BLAZE
          hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to contain himself. If
          the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him.
          The Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an OPEN WINDOW
          nearby. He shuts it, lights his cigarette, turns back -- b=
          Blaze has moved on.

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo settles back in his chair.

                         ARLO
          If this guy's as lethal as you say he is,
          I want fifty for me, another fifty for the
          club. Only you can't let the boys know
          we're takin' a 50K rake off the top, see?

                         CARRIGAN
          How `bout sixty and I'll throw in a kilo
          of coke?

                         ARLO

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Coke? That's like selling snow to
          Eskimos. You think I'm some kind of
          crack-smoking foolio or something?

           Arlo reaches into his shoulder-holster, whipping out a mean
          looking nickel-plated Colt 44 Anaconda.

                         ARLO
          Ninety, and not a nickel less, you
          fucking pillow-biter.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Blaze continues, agitated. Where the fuck is the kid? He
          looks through a doorway, SEES --

          TEN OR MORE
          brutish gargoyles drinking beer and cleaning their weapons.
          Blaze drops back. His snarling face contorts, starts to
          assume that awful skullish quality. The Ghost Rider wants
          out. mow. But Blaze fights, shoves it back down and deep.
          SOMETHING moves to Blaze's right -- a TINY WHITE FIGURE,
          lolling and flopping at the far end of the passage.

          EXT. QUARRY - COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Nomi slices through another fuel line, inadvertently drawing
           the attention of a Gargoyle who was taking a leak. He zips
           up his jeans, starts towards her --

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

           Carrigan grins, trying to calm the situation.

                          CARRIGAN
          E a sy, gentlemen. No need to get all
           truculent on me.

                         ARLO
          Truculent? You get that out of a
          Scrabble dictionary or something? What
          the fuck does "truculent" mean?
          (grabbing Carrigan by his shirt)
          I'll tell you what it means. It means

          FUCK YOU!

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Blaze stares, hypnotised, his face flickering from skull to
          flesh and back again. The tiny figure is Rain's SKELETON
          DOLL, held upright, unsteady, by some unseen force.

          THAT MOMENT, ELSEWHERE - RAIN'S FACE
          Extreme mental concentration. Temples pounding. Her eyes
          are fluttering, rolled to white.

          BACK TO BLAZE
          as he starts towards the toy skeleton. He's in agony now,
          each breath a cough of fire, each footstep igniting the
          floorboards. He SEES a storage room up ahead --

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Carrigan smiles, seemingly unruffled by the gun.

                         CARRIGAN
          Okay, alright -- how about seventy-five
          and we'll smoke the old peace pipe?

                         ARLO

          How `bout eighty or you're gonna be
          smoking my dick?

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze enters, SEES Rain. He extends a hand to her -- and
          Odell steps out from behind the door where he'd been hiding,
          shotgun in hand.

          The Gargoyle has spotted her. He draws a Taurus pistol --

          EXT. QUARRY, COMPOUND - NIGHT

           A FIREBALL erupts from the back of the building. The milling
          Gargoyles spring into action.
           Nomi takes advantage of the distraction, STABS the Gargoyle
          nearest her in the thigh, bolts --

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Carrigan and the others race out into the corridor even as
          Odell rushes from the storage room, a WAVE OF FIRE on his
          heels.

          THE GHOST RIDER
          emerges seconds later, Rain cradled in the crook of his arm,
          safe in a cool bubble of air. She looks to Carrigan. The
          meaning in her gaze is implicit: "I told you so".

                         GARGOYLES
          appear from every direction. Guns BLAZE. Bullets turn-to
          slag, vaporizing as they enter the Ghost Rider's aura of
          hellfire.
          Rain drops from the Ghost Rider's arm, runs. The Ghost Rider
          advances. The Gargoyle nearest him empties a machine pistol
          into the Ghost Rider. The Ghost Rider reaches for the
          weapon. At his touch, the pistol becomes RED HOT --
          The Gargoyle CRIES OUT. The Ghost Rider takes the pistol, and
          FIRES BACK. The Gargoyles stumble, clawing at their smoking
          wounds. In seconds, the entire weapon turns WHITE HOT, melting
          apart in the demon's hand, SIZZLING away into nothing --
          The Ghost Rider keeps coming. Men are SMASHED aside,
          incinerated. Bravado turns to terror, to chaotic scramble --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          FLAMES belch from every window. Panic-stricken Gargoyles try
          to start their bikes -- and the bikes detonate. one after the
          other!
          CRASH! Nomi's pickup barrels through the fence. She slaloms
          through a gauntlet of flames, skidding to a halt. She SEES
          Rain running towards her, throws open the passenger door --

                         NOMI

          RAIN! "
          Rain makes for the pickup, scrambles inside even as --

          THE GHOST RIDER
          strides from the burning ruins of the compound. With a wave
          of his hand, the wall of flame parts like the Red Sea. He
          locks his gaze with Nomi, points a skeletal finger at her.
          His meaning is clear: "You are on the list."
          Nomi floors the gas. The pickup slews and grinds, finds
          purchase, leaps away from the monster as --

          THE PULSIFER BROTHERS
          emerge from the building, burned but howling for blood,
          fueled by a lethal combination of stupidity and crystal mech.
          Carrigan, Landsdale, and Arlo fall in behind.
          The Ghost Rider moves, whipping his red hot chains. Left, he
          lassos a passing gargoyle, BURNS him. Right, another
          Gargoyle, dragged from his bike and reduced to ash.
          Then two more lashes to either side of the brothers. Two
          more victims reeled in -- charred corpses falling at the
          Ghost Rider's feet. The whole thing took three seconds.

                         CHESTER
          (to Gunt, nerves failing)
          Forget it, bro, live to fight another day.
          The Ghost Rider slams his skeletal hand on the tank of a
          nearby bike. The bike glows RED HOT and CHANGES SHAPE,
          getting bigger, nastier, demonically slouched --

                         GUNT
          No fucking way! That's my hog!
          As the Ghost Rider mounts the newly transformed hellcycle,
          Gunt charges forward, infuriated. He OPENS FIRE with his
          mini-â¢un, .er. rounds a second.

                         CONTINUED:
          Moving with uncanny speed, the Ghost Rider grips Gunt by the
          throat and hauls him off his feet, unleashing the full fury
          of his Penance Stare.

          A BLAST-WAVE OF LIGHT
          erupts from the Ghost Rider's eye sockets, engulfing Gunt.
          Gunt SHRIEKS, his cries becoming infant-like ULULATIONS.
          Arlo, Carrigan, Chester, and the others instinctively shield
          their faces, falling back from the infernal glow --

                         CHESTER
          Gunt!

          ON GUNT,
          images from his own subjective hell assault him. Tears
          stream down his cheeks as his body ignites. His corneas are
          burning, melting.
          The Ghost Rider starts to accelerate now, from zero to sixty
          in an eye-blink, hauling Gunt's writhing body along with him
          - straight into the burning building.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          A juggernaut trajectory crashing through wall after blazing
          wall. The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, HURLS Gunt to the
          floor. Senses SOMEONE behind him --

          A FIRE EXTINGUISHER,
          blasting the Ghost Rider's head. The Ghost Rider SQUEALS
          and for a split-second, the demon's flames are actually
          snuffed out. The cloud clears. The Ghost Rider glimpses

                         ODELL
          rushing into another room, SLAMMING a steel door behind.

          INT. QUARRY - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

          Odell pauses in the darkness, hyperventilating. Outside, we
          hear the heavy FOOTFALLS of the Ghost Rider approaching.

          INT. QUARRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          The Ghost Rider places a skeletal hand against the steel
          door. His hand GLOWS WHITE HOT, like an acetylene torch.
          The steel door begins to bubble and melt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          INT. QUARRY - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

          The door to the storage room liquefies, flowing apart like
          molten lava. The Ghost Rider steps through and --
          -- in the light cast by .he demon's owing hand. Odell
           realizes that the room is stacked with high explosives.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Nomi's pickup races into the night. A distant FIREBALL
          ERUPTS hugely, engulfing the quarry, setting off a chain
          reaction of smaller explosions -- BA-BOOM-BOOM-B-B-BOOOOM!

          EXT/INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - NIGHT

          Rain clutches at Nomi, frantic, looking back.

                         RAIN
          What about the Ghost Rider? We have to
          go back for him!

                         NOMI
          Are you crazy?! Sit down!
          Then Nomi glances in the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God.

          THE GHOST RIDER
          is coming after them. HOWLING, plowing through the inferno
          on his hellcycle.
          Nomi floors the gas. But the pickup is already maxed out.
          The Ghost Rider easily gains on the truck, leaving a wake of
          burning asphalt. He lashes out with his chains, snags the
          back bumper. The chain-links slice deep into the steel
          bodywork. The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel --
          Nomi slams on the brakes. The truck fishtails. The Ghost
          Rider rear-ends the pickup. Bike and demon cartwheel crazily
          into the cargo bed, SLAMMING explosively against the back
          window of the cab. Hot glass showers Nomi and Rain --
          The Ghost Rider is pinned, SQUEALING, entangled with his bike.
          Nomi floors it again. The truck leaps ahead --
          -- but the Ghost Rider hangs on as his bike slides backwards.
          He reaches into the cab, clutching at Nomi. The pickup
          thunders up a rise --

                         CONTINUED:
          The Ghost Rider's skeletal fingers clamp Nomi's shoulder.
          She HOWLS in pain, her clothing beginning to smoke. Rain
          tries to help, imploring --

                          RAIN
          No, no, no --

          EXT/INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - DAY

          The truck makes the rise -- and there's THE SUN, dawning huge
          and white. flaring mightily over the distant horizon.

          THE GHOST RIDER
          recoils, blinded by the dawn. He releases Nomi, collapses
          backwards. His fire extinguishes, his skull-face fades --
          -- and Blaze lies in the pickup bed, shaking. Nomi glances
          back through the shattered cab window, her face a mask of
          fear and sympathy. Blaze looks to Gunt's bike, which has
          also reverted to its original state, then SEES --

                         BLAZE'S POV:
          The bad guys coming on battered bikes -- Arlo, Chester, plus
          FOUR OTHER GARGOYLES. And bringing up the rear, a seven ton
          Mack dumper driven by Carrigan. Landsdale rides shotgun.
          Blaze looks to Nomi, SHOUTS over the wind:

                         BLAZE
          Give me your gun!
          Nomi passes it back. The Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing
          and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt's cycle off the pickup bed
          The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the first
          Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debris

          EXT. INTERSECTION/HIGHWAY - DAY

          Nomi runs a stops sign, slews across a rural intersection,
          pounds the HORN, swerving to avoid the crossing cars --

          AN ONCOMING TANKER TRUCK
          brakes, jack-knifes. Four gargoyles make it past, the fifth
          is flattened. The Mack comes last, SMASHING a passing
          minivan into a spin --

                         CONTINUED:

          ANGLE ON A GAS STATION
          A STATE TROOPER, hidden from view, hits his SIREN, gives

                         CHASE --

          BACK TO ARLO AND THE OTHER GARGOYLES
          Gaining, riddling the pickup with BULLETS. Blaze is pinned
          in the bed, can't get off a shot --

          ON CHESTER PULSIFER,
          hanging back and riding one-handed. He hefts a 66mm LAWs
          rocket on his shoulder, LAUNCHES it --
          Near miss. But the impact lifts the pickup's rear axle into
          the air. Nomi SCREAMS. Blaze hangs on for dear life.

          ON CARRIGAN,
          hauling the Mack alongside Chester --

                         CARRIGAN
          (yelling from the cab)
          The hell you doing? I need the kid
          alive!!!

                         CHESTER
          Fuck the kid and FUCK YOU!!!
          Chester aims the launcher again. Carrigan swerves, CRUSHES
          Chester under the Mack's mighty wheels.

          THE TROOPER CAR
          pulls alongside the Mack, SIREN wailing. Carrigan veers
          hard, forcing it into the opposing lane. Up ahead:
          ROADWORKS. The highway narrows to a single lane --

          BACK TO ARLO AND THE GARGOYLES
          Gaining on the pickup, trading shots with Blaze at ninety
          miles and hour.
          Blaze wings one Gargoyle, then plugs another who loses
          control, cartwheels catastrophically, EXPLODES --
           Arlo zigzags the debris, guns his hog, screams closer. Blaze
          fires but -- CLICK, CLICK, CLICK -- he's out!

                         ROADWORKS
          The pickup mows down barricades like dominoes, clips a hot
          tar cooker, spins spumes of molten tar in all directions.
          HIGHWAY WORKERS run for their lives.
          Nomi SMASHES through barricades, leaps a pile of rough
          gravel. Blaze is nearly hurled out the bed, but hangs on,
          shoulder screaming --

          A FOREGROUND WORKER
          operating a jackhammer fails to notice the careening pickup
          racing by, which-is, in turn, followed by Arlo and --

          THE MACK TRUCK AND THE STATE TROOPER,
          ana necx at OOFJ2 Ann r i t s
          over, end.

          BACK TO SCENE
           Arlo rides against Nomi's door, lets rip with his Uzi. Glass
          SHATTERS. Rain and Nomi duck --
          Arlo tries again, sticks his Uzi right into the cab. But
          Nomi forces the gun upwards. Bullets puncture the roof,
          shell casings ricochet-
          In desperation, Nomi reaches for the door latch, kicks her
          foot against the door. The door swings outward, taking Arlo
          along with it.

                         UP AHEAD
          is a concrete divider. Nomi abruptly veers right, clipping
          Arlo against the divider, killing him instantly.

                         ON BLAZE
          hauling himself back into the pickup bed even as --

                         THE MACK
          bears down on them. Landsdale jumps from the cab, landing
          alongside Blaze. The two men struggle in the cargo bed, hand
          to hand, exchanging a volley of vicious blows.
          Nomi is desperate, doesn't know what to do. Landsdalp is
          getting the upper hand. He grips Blaze by the throat,
          forcing him over the side of the pickup bed, shoving Blaze's
          head towards the churning wheels of the Mack --

          concentrating, focusing all her energy on Landsdale. She
          CRIES OUT, makes a forceful hand gesture --
          -- and Landsdale's glasses SHATTER. He SCREAMS, blood
          pouring from his eyes. Blaze rolls, throws Landsdale over
          his shoulder -- into the wheels of the Mack.

          UP AHEAD, A MASSIVE ROADBLOCK
          Barricades, bulldozers, dozens of state police cars.
          The pickup and the Mack pass over a line of TIRE SPIKES. The
          tires BLOW. The trucks drop. Metal rims SPARK and GRIND --

          NOMI (CONT' D)
          Hold on to something!
          She brakes. The pickup fishtails. Carrigan also brakes,
          struggling to keep the Mack under control. Then the Mack
          catches a rim, flips, rolls --

                         SLOW MOTION
          The rolling Mack plows into the roadblock, seven tons of iron
          crushing cruisers and barricades alike.
          The pickup careens off the road, plunges into a cornfield,
          hits a rut, grinds to a halt --

          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES
          The aftermath. Trooper cars sliding to a halt.
          Carrigan being dragged from the Mack at gun point, handcuffed.
          Armed TROOPERS plunging into the cornfield, YELLING.
          Nomi falling out of the cab, finding Rain, unhurt, alive.
          She drags Rain into the sea of corn. Rain looks back, SEES --

          INT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

          A cacophony of noise for the new meat. Hardened CRIMINALS
          BANGING their bars, SHOUTING as loud as they can.

                         ON BLAZE
          chained, cuffed, struggling with TWO DEPUTIES trying to drag
          him to a cell. Further up, Carrigan is being similarly
          escorted. Blaze looks to the faces of his fellow prisoners,
          dread seizing his body.

                         BLAZE
          I have to talk to the warden. You have
          to put me someplace else --

                         DEPUTY #1
          Should've thought of that before you
          pulled that "Dukes of Hazzard" stunt.

          Please, just listen to me. Put me in
          solitary, anywhere but here.

           This isn't a fucking hotel, chief.

           You don't understand, people will die --

          Easy on the threats, big guy --

          Do not put me in here! Do not leave me
          with these men! They'll die if you do

          The deputies force Blaze inside, using batons, boots. A stun
          gun SPARKS. Blaze falls. The cell door SLAMS. The inmates
          opposite are LAUGHING, waving, bashing their bars with every

          Rain step off a bus, each carrying a bag of supplies.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Simple and clean. Rain locks the door, goes to the window
          and opens it wide -- a beautiful day outside, hills rolling
          down to a busy town a mile distant.
          Nomi drops her bag, sits wearily on the bed, peels her jacket
          open -- revealing a nasty shoulder wound. Burned to the
          bone, the impression of fingers clearly evident.
          Rain hurries to help, rummages antiseptics and bandages from
          Nomi's bag. Together, they clean the wound. Nomi's pain is
          clear, but she keeps it quiet.

                         RAIN
          Are we safe now?
          Nomi regards her sadly. She's never been one to tell lies.

                         NOMI
          Honey, I don't know if we'll ever be
          safe.
          Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about
          her look -- far too fatalistic for a child her age.

                         RAIN
          He talks to me sometimes.

                         NOMI
          Who?

                         RAIN
          My father --

          -- when I'm dreaming.

                         (FEARFUL)
          What does he say?
          Rain starts to cry now, suddenly overwhelmed. Despite her
          eerily calm demeanor, she's still a child. And a frightened
          one at that.

                         RAIN
          I don't want to be like him, mom.

          Yes, I do, baby --
          Nomi hugs her, desperate, as if the world were ending.

          On Blaze, immobile. Waiting for nightfall. Shadows lengthen

          She contemplates her sleeping child a moment, then taps a
          pack of Camels, realizes she's out.

          Nomi quietly closes the door. Walks to the far end where the

          A BRIEF FLASH OF THE PAST
          Nomi back on the bed, ODing. The SHADOW of Starke falling

          BACK TO THE PRESENT
          as Nomi turns to the parking lot, SEES a coyote slouching out

          Blaze suddenly CRIES OUT, throwing himself onto the floor.
          He begins to writhe as the other prisoners jeer at him.

          The Ghost Rider stands in the center of Blaze's cell, a
          cyclone of hellfire swirling around him -- for there is a
          direct, casual relationship between the amplitude of his rage
          and the number of transgressors in its vicinity.
          He moves forward, melting the cell bars, stepping into --

          THE CORRIDOR BEYOND
          The prisoners are frantic, leaping about like frightened lab
          animals.
          THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost Rider's heavy FOOTFALLS ring out as
          it strides down the corridor, turning his awful gaze on the
          first cell. The Ghost Rider extends a hand, sending a STREAM
          OF HELLFIRE coursing over the prisoner within.
          The Ghost Rider moves on, to the second and third cells,
          swiveling his gaze back and forth, BURNING the occupants
          within. Like shooting fish in a barrel.
          THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost Rider continues its rampage.
          Murderers, rapists, malefactors. Some curse, others plead,
          others simply drop to their knees and pray. For they know,
          instinctively, that the universe is not an arbitrary place,
          that their Day of Judgement has come.
          The entire jail is ablaze now, a roiling extension of the
          Ghost Rider's fury, drowning out the VOICES OF THE DAMNED.

          ON THE FINAL CELL
          where Carrigan cowers within. The deck of cards in his hands
          drops, scatters. Some of them catch fire, shrivel up --

          The Ghost Rider waves his hand. The bars separating them
          melt, flowing to the floor like liquid. He stares down at
          Carrigan, his hollow eve sockets sparking to life.

          AS THE PENANCE STARE
          erupts from the Ghost Rider's eyes, Carrigan reaches for
          something beneath the bed --
          cell wall. He holds it up.
          The effect is catastrophic, like the Medusa having her own
          deadly gaze turned back upon her. The Ghost Rider stumbles
          backwards, SHRIEKING, assaulted by an onslaught of subjective
          images. Visions horrifying enough to drive even a demon mad.

          EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- NIGHT

          The windows of the jail pulse with HELLFIRE, panes of safety
          glass EXPLODING OUTWARDS as a blast-wave expands and expands,

          Starke kneels, touching a hand to Carrigan's chest. The
          world ebbs away again. The paramedics continue their work,
          oblivious. Carrigan MOANS.

           Thousand-yard stare in his eyes. He contemplates the gun

                         SILENT MEMORIES
          assault him -- good times with Roxanne, happy times, making
           the onrush that much more unbearable. We INTERCUT --

          ROXANNE,
          radiant at the beach. Flickering sunshine makes her squint.

          BACK TO BLAZE,
          here and now, cocking the gun, turning it back on himself.

                         ROXANNE
          folding clothes, seen through a sunny doorway.

          fingering the trigger of the gun, edging closer to the
          unknown, the terrors that the afterlife holds for him.

          Fuck it. He presses the barrel against his forehead.
          Squeezes his eyes tightly shut, compresses the trigger --
          -- but he can't do it. He lowers the gun, weeping with
          frustration and -- freezes, head cocked like he heard a
          voice. He scans the cemetery: graves, trees, nothing. Then
          he spins around ---

                         RAIN
          stands behind him, waif-like. Big, melancholy eyes. They
          stare at each other for a long time, not knowing what to say.

                         RAIN
          My mother is dead.
          The statement hangs. Another death. Another failure of
          Blaze's part.

          My father found us, just like she knew he

          Rain looks down at Blaze's hand -- the gun resting there.
          Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed.
          The wind picks up. Rain looks to the graves.

          Blaze studies Rain. This kid is hurting. What she needs
          now, is reassurance. And try as he might, Blaze just can' t
          seem to harden his heart against her.

                         BLAZE
          Yeah, I think there's something. Maybe
          not angels playing harps and stuff, but

                         (SEARCHING)
          -- something.
          Rain wipes her nose with her sleeve, wanting to believe it.

          He'll keep coming, you know. Unless you
          stop him.

          But you'll try, right?
          Blaze regards her curiously. Even in grief, she's a
          consummate negotiator.

                         BLAZE
          I don't have anything left to give, kid.
          Blaze stands, starts walking. Rain follows.

          My mother said you were a good man.

          She said I could trust you.

                         BLAZE
          You can't.

                         RAIN

                         (PERSISTENT)
          But don't you think there's a reason why
          all of this is happening? Like fate?

                         RAIN
          Maybe it believes in you.
          Blaze stops. Cold. Deja-vu all over again. He looks back
          at Rain. Sighs.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY - DAY

          A battered truck full of MIGRANT FARM-WORKERS grinds to a
          halt. Blaze and rain jump out in a cloud of dust.

                         DRIVER

                         (POINTING)
          Alla! Mision de Sante Lupia!
          High up the mountain: an old adobe building perched on
          stilts, precariously overhung. On top of its bell tower, a
          crucifix stands clear and proud.

                         RAIN
          We're going to a church?

                         BLAZE
          It's not a church. It's a mission. They
          take people in.
          Blaze pays the driver. The truck roars away. Rain looks
          back to the mission, doubtful.

                         RAIN
          Are you going to dump me there?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE MISSION - DAY

          18th Century Spanish adobe. Chapel and dormitory, currently
          under renovation. VARIOUS TOUGH-LOOKING MEN are at work.
          Picks and hoes clink in the dirt.
          Blaze and Rain make their way towards the main building.
          TOLBEIN (40s, hard, mistrustful) intercepts them.

                         TOLBEIN

          Our car broke down a few miles back and
          my daughter and I were wondering if we
          could crash here for the night.
          Tolbein sizes them up -- doesn't like what he sees.

                         TOLBEIN
          Don't think so.

                         BLAZE
          What about a ride, then? Is there a town
          somewhere you could take us to?
          Other men have gathered behind Tolbein -- VISCOTT, WILSON.
          One of them, NUNEZ, nods to the South.

                         NUNEZ
          Why don't you head back to Dawson? They
          got motels there.

                         BLAZE
          That's not really an option.

                         TOLBEIN
          Then I'd say you're out of luck.

                         BLAZE
          Look, you must have a cot, something. The
          kid's hungry --

           RHYMER (O.S. )
          I'm sure we can figure something out.
          JOE RHYMER, 50s, approaches, silences Tolbein with a look.
          He's down to earth, capable, wearing a black shirt, cleric's
          collar, oily jeans, and muddy work boots.

                         RHYMER (CONT'D)
          (offering his hand)
          Joe Rhymer. I'm the Padre.

                         BLAZE
          This is Rain.

                         RHYMER
          Rain? That's a pretty name.

                         (TO RAIN)
          You hungry, Rain? Would you like
          something to eat?
          Rain nods. Rhymer ushers them inside. As he moves to
          follow, Tolbein stops him.

          Bottom line, Father. There's something
          wrong with those two. Especially the
          kid.

                         RHYMER
          Duly noted, Richard.

                         (POINTEDLY)
          And overruled.

          ANGLE ON A RAGGEDY FIGURE
          jutting into frame in the foreground. Blaze pauses at the
          threshold of the chapel, looks back, uneasy -- but it's just
          a SCARECROW being buffeted about by the wind.

          INT. MISSION - CHAPEL - DAY

          Rhymer leads Blaze down the central aisle. The chapel is
          dark, lit by candle-light, crowded with scaffolding and drop-
          sheets. As Blaze walks, the flames of the candles bend in
          his direction -- as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force.

                         BLAZE
          Those men outside --

                         RHYMER
          Most of them are on a work-release
          program. We're a halfway house for ex-
          offenders. We try to get people on their
          feet, reintegrate them into society.
          Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive.

                          RHYMER (CONT'D)
           (misreading Blaze's look)
           Don't worry, you're perfectly safe here.
           But of course, that's not what Blaze is thinking.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. MISSION - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

          Rain sits at the table, spooning her soup. Tolbein, Nunez
          and a few others watch them. Blaze watches them back,
          nonchalant in the face of their obvious hostility.

          EXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

          BUILDERS working. Men carrying provisions. There's a small
          vegetable garden in the center of the courtyard. Rain helps
          the GARDENER pull carrots.

                         CONTINUED:
          Blaze watches from a distance, cleaned up, clothes laundered--
          Rhymer approaches, gestures to the garden.

                         RHYMER
          It's turned out beautiful, hasn't it? We
          try to be as self sufficient as we can,
          back to the earth and all that.
          He notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun.

                         RHYMER (CONT'D)
          You any good with diesel engines?

                         BLAZE
          I know my way around a flywheel housing.

                         RHYMER
          Well I've got a generator out back that's
          been on life support the last few weeks.
          Mind helping me try to resuscitate it?
          Blaze looks at him curiously.

                         BLAZE
          Sure.

          INT. BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Blaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old
          generator. There are a number of vehicles stored around
          them, including a pair of dusty motorcycles.

                         RHYMER
          So how long have you been running?

                         BLAZE
          What do you mean?

                         RHYMER
          You know what I mean. You spend as much
          time around lost souls as I have, you
          learn how to read a man's face.

                         (NODDING)
          You want to hand me that crescent wrench?
          Blaze hands Rhymer the wrench, who then makes an adjustment.

                         RHYMER (CONT'D)
          Take the girl, for instance. She's not
          your daughter, is she?

                         BLAZE
          She's dead.

                         RHYMER
          Did you kill her?

                         BLAZE
          No.
          Rhymer studies Blaze, decides he believes him.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)

                         (ELABORATING)
          She doesn't have anyone else. I'm just
          trying to protect her.

                         RHYMER
          And who's protecting you?

          MOMENTS LATER,
          Blaze and Rhymer are cleaning up.

                         BLAZE
          Listen, I appreciate what you're trying
          to do, but I've never really been a come
          to Jesus kind of guy.

                         RHYMER
          I wasn't talking about Jesus, I was
          talking about a little healthy
          introspection. Working here, staying in
          one place for a while, seeing what
          surfaces. I've found that people tend to
          arrive on our doorstep for a reason.
          Blaze considers this formidable man, a yearning moment
          then he shakes his head.

                         BLAZE
          I can't stay. I'm sorry.

                         RHYMER
          What about the girl, then? Whatever
          you're involved in, I can't imagine it's
          good for her well-being.
          (beat, gentle)
          We can find a home for her.

           I'd have to leave tonight --
           Rhymer nods, understanding, he motions towards a beautiful
           motorcycle parked back in the shadows -- a `71 Norton
          Commando 850. Black, with gold pin-striping.

                         RHYMER
          You can take the Norton.

                         BLAZE
          I don't have any money.

                         RHYMER
          So send us some when you do.
          Blaze is moved by this man's simple humanity -- but he's also
          wrestling with the idea of abandoning Rain.

          EXT. MISSION - DUSK/NIGHT

          TIME-LAPSING SHADOWS cross the mission buildings and the
          surrounding wilderness landscape. The lonely scarecrow
          stares button-eyed and blank.

          INT. MISSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze gazes into a bathroom mirror. Been here so many times
          before. SOUNDS intrude upon his solitude.
          He bows his head, studies the coin, turning it over in his
          shaking fingers. The malicious coyote, the soaring eagle.
          Still the SOUNDS come, stronger, more insistent --
          Cars CRASHING. Police SIRENS wailing. SCREAMS. GUNFIRE.

          FLAMES.
          Blaze looks up once more. His eyes are shadowed sockets.
          This is the real PENANCE STARE, and Blaze is feeling its
          awful, mournful ache.

                         NOMI'S VOICE
          He wants to know if you're a bad man.
          He wants to know -- if the Ghost Rider
          turned its penance stare on you, would
          you burn?
          Blaze clenches his fist around the coin, spins on his heels.

          INT. MISSION - DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze pauses in the doorway, looking in on Rain, who sleeps,
          dead to the world. Blaze sets the coyote coin on the bed
          table next to her, turns and leaves.
          We HOLD ON Rain's sleeping face for a beat, then she stirs,
          opening her eyes. She SEES the coin nearby, sits up.

          INT. MISSION - STORM CELLAR - NIGHT

          The Norton Commando ROARS into life, blasting webs from the
          exhaust. Blaze guides the bike up the coal ramp and out
          through the open cellar doors.

          EXT. MISSION - NIGHT

          A STORM FRONT is moving in, huge thunderheads gathering and
          roiling. Blaze pulls a dusty skid, pauses with the engine
          RUMBLING. Looks back forlornly at the mission. Then he
          wrings the throttle and hauls away into the night as we --

          Rhymer shakes his head, looks to --

                         RAIN
          She's acutely conscious of the men staring at her now, still
          clutching the coin like a rabbit's foot.

                         TOLBEIN
          It's her -- she's the one doing this.

                         RHYMER
          That's enough, Richard.

                         TOLBEIN
          I'm telling you, Father, there's
          something wrong with --
          CRASH! One of the windows SLAMS open, startling everyone.
          Rhymer moves to it, latches it shut again.

          INT. MISSION - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

          LIGHTNING flashes. An eerie HOWLING arises. Tolbein and
          Nunez lead some men to the front door. Tolbein unbars the
          door, pulls it open, can't believe his eyes: THREE DOZEN
          HOWLING COYOTES, approaching the entrance.

                         TOLBEIN
          What is this?!
           SCARE! A snarling coyote comes out of left field, just
          misses his throat --
           Tolbein leaps backward, SLAMS the door. The men start
           SHOUTING. Rain backs away. She knows what's happening.
           WHAM! An animal rams the door. Then another. And another --

          INT. MISSION - RHYMER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Rhymer breaks out a shotgun, shells, hears the men SHOUTING.

          INT. MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rhymer rushes in. The men are confused, afraid. WHAM!
          WHAM! GROWLING coyotes are hurling themselves repeatedly
          against the windows, cracking the panes.

                         RHYMER
          Get away from the windows!

                         (TO WILSON)
          Wilson, take Rain to the chapel.

                         WILSON
          I ain't going nowhere with her.
          All the men are giving Rain a wide berth now. WHAM! Another
          snarling coyote hits the glass.

                         RHYMER
          One of you, please, just take the kid to
          the chapel.

                         TOLBEIN
          Father, that's the last place she should
          be.
          CRUNCH! Something strikes the room a massive blow.
          Something MUCH BIGGER than a coyote. Viscott starts praying.

                         NUNEZ
          Quiet, Viscott!
          THUMP! CRUMP! More heavy blows. Like the Fist of God.
          Making the floorboards beneath their feet vibrate. SOMETHING
          shambles past the window. What in God's name was that?

                         TOLBEIN
          (looking at Rain, accusing)
          I knEw we should've sent them away!
          THOOM! Another impact. THOOM!THOOM! Plaster cracks. Dust
          falls. Viscott wails, praying even more stridently. Nunez
          is losing it_

                         NUNEZ

          SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN!

          She's the one they want, I'm telling you!
          -- and the lights abruptly go ou The storm bellows and
           blusters. The men huddle together, fear thick and sour.

           CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          Raainn -- Raaaaiinnn --
          A gastly VOICE, monstrously corrupt, but still recognizable
          as Billy-Ray Carrigan.

          CARRIGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          -- where are you, Rainnnnnnn?
          Rain shrinks away from the insidious mewling.

           (to Rhymer, hissing)
          I told you --
          Even Rhymer is shaken now. He moves to investigate, presses
          up against a cracked window --

          RHYMER'S POV (THROUGH WINDOW)
          Carrigan stands outside, lurching between patterns of
          moonlight and shadow. But the movement is all wrong. And in
          our momentary glimpses of him, we get the sense that he's
          been horribly changed -- as if his body had been torn apart,
          then haphazardly reassembled into something else.
          CRUNCH! The wall fractures. Rhymer staggers back. WHUMP!
          CRUNCH! A row of impacts moves along the wall --
          Tolbein and Nunez scramble to reach the dining room door.
          They close it, turning the locks.
          WHANG! Carrigan slams against the other side of the heavy,
          steel door. WHANG!WHANG! Again and again and again. The
          men are terrified, SHOUTING at each other. The door is
          buckling inward, the hinges bending and GROANING --
          Then the pummelling stops. Just the sound of BREATHING,
          halting and phlegmatic. No one moves, not a whisper.
          CORROSION starts to spread across the metal door.

                         NUNEZ
          What the fuck --?!
           Rhymer edges close to the decaying door, peering through a gap
          in the frame --
          Carrigan peers back, moonlight illuminating his face. There
          are buttons where his eyes should 12P. He BELLOWS:

                         CARRIGAN

          PRIEST! GIVE ME THE GIRL!
          The POUNDING begins anew, harder now. The weakened door is
          surely about to give way. Rain is terrified.

                         TOLBEIN
          Do what he says! Put her out!

                         RHYMER
          Get back with the others!

          We don't do what it says, that thing
          outside there's gonna kill us all.
          Rhymer steps in front of Rain, levels his shotgun at
          Tolbein's chest.

                         RHYMER
          God as my witness, Richard, lay a hand on
          that girl and I will pull this trigger.
          Tolbein hesitates -- then grabs at the shotgun. He twists it
          from Rhymer's hands, SMASHES the butt across Rhymer's jaw.
          Rhymer sinks to the floor.
          Tolbein grabs Rain, drags her SCREAMING to the door. He
          waves the shotgun at the others --

                         TOLBEIN
          Open the fucking door! DO IT!
          Nunez fumbles with the lock. Rhymer recovers, throws himself
          at Nunez, tries stop him from opening it. The pounding
          ceases. All eyes sweep to the door --

                         TWO BUTTONS
          roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the
          floor, coming to rest at Rhymer's feet -- immediately oottina
          the floorboards beneath them.

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          (a skin-crawling whisper)
          I can see you, Priest. I can see every
          last one of you.

          THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN,
          knocking Tolbein, Rain, Rhymer and Nunez on their asses. All
          eyes bug as Carrigan shoulders his way inside. Only he's n..t
          Carrigan anymore. Now he's --

                         THE SCARECROW
          A golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and
          sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and razor wire.
          Button-socket eyes. Jagged bone teeth. Beetle-black chitin
          for fingers and nails.
          His very existence is an affront to nature. Everything the
          Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays. Floorboards
          rot, metal rusts. Every movement, every spastic shudder and
          twitch is a source of incalculable pain.

          The Scarecrow thrusts his hand out and a STORM OF DEMONIC
          CROWS explodes from his chest, whirling about like a cyclone
          of knives.
          Now the coyotes enter too. Dozens of them, SNARLING, DIVING
          at the men, sinking their jaws into flesh.
           The men are trapped. Some try to flee. Others fight back,
          swinging chairs and planks --

                         THE SCARECROW
          stalks into their midst, snaring victims left and right,
          HURLING bodies or pulling them apart --
          He snatches Viscott up by his throat. Bugs swarm over the
          SCREAMING parolee's face as it rots and decays. In seconds,
          Viscott's entire body decomposes, putrefies, falls apart --

          RHYMER AND RAIN
          back up towards the kitchen. SCREECH! A crow-thing comes
          flapping. Rhymer FIRES. The creature SHRIEKS and flops --
          Nunez claws another from his face, SEES it's not a crow at
          all, but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a
          deformed razor beak, matted feathers, bony talons --
          Wilson, trapped under a bench, BEATS desperately at a
          gnashing coyote. Lands a real blow. The beast falls back
          then stands up like a man?

                         VARIOUS ANGLES
          as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise. The coyotes are changing
          shape, enlarging, canine skeletons CRACKING and re-arranging
          themselves into --

                         JAW-BEASTS
          The same half-glimpsed horrors we glimpsed accompanying
          Starke. All muscle and gnashing fangs and bloody, ripping
          claws.

          EXT. COASTAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Blaze rolls the Norton to a stop. Kills the engine. Sits
          back in the saddle and drinks in the night.
          The moonlit landscape is profoundly silent, the starry sky
          clear and awesome. Nothing stirs.

                         BLAZE'S POV
          Distant thunderheads. LIGHTNING flickering.
          CLOSE ON Blaze, trying to drive Rain from his mind. We can
          SEE on his face that it's a losing battle -- for poor, cursed
          Johnny Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MISSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Claws and jaws and razor-beaks tearing frenziedly through
          wood and plaster and lathe. Rhymer, Rain, Nunez and Tolbein
          struggle to repel the monsters, beating them back with
          whatever is at hand --
          -- but the jaw-beasts and razor birds are winning, forcing
          their way into the kitchen --
          Nunz is snagged. Slashing claws swarm all over him. The
          others try to pull him free --
          Rhymer wastes two more precious SHOTS, but Nunez is lost.
          Dragged SCREAMING into the storm of mouths and claws. The
          survivors fall back as the door gives and --

                         THE SCARECROW
          pitches through the opening, lurching forward. Jaw-beasts
          fall in behind him. Razor birds whirl around his head.
          The survivors scramble for the far exit. Rain opens every
          gas burner on the grill as she passes by -- but the far exit
          is locked. And Rhymer doesn't have the key!
          BOOM! Rhymer shotguns the lock! The lock fractures, but the
          exit still won't open. Tolbein starts kicking. Rhymer aims

          reels. Burning jaw-beasts writhe and howl.

           Blaze. Coming back. Ninety_ One hundred. Wind tears
           wildly at his hair, jacket. The bike shudders. The
          tachometer edges upwards --
          One twenty. One twenty-five. Nitrous booster. The Norton
          SCREAMS. One thirty. One forty. One fifty --
          HEAT streams off Blaze. FLAMES wisp from his nostrils. One
          sixty. One seventy.
          The tachometer SHATTERS. The engine smokes. The bike
          SHRIEKS, pushing the edge of mechanical reason.
          FLAMES explode from Blaze's mouth and eyes. His hands
          ignite. He CRIES OUT in agony. His body alters violently.
          His face warps. Bones crack and shift. Flesh shrinks and
          tightens as the skull-visage emerges.
          The bike changes too, red heat spreading throughout.
          Tortured metal SCREECHES. Straining machinery pops and
          bulges. Shafts lengthen into skeletal "bones". The saddle
          slouches. The tank distends --
          WHOOMPF! The wheels ignite, then the whole bike. HELLFIRE
          streams, an extension of Blaze's rage.
          Blaze SCREAMS from the pit of his soul as the Ghost Rider
          claws itself into being, more manifest that ever before --
          And that's when the bike really accelerates -
          -- so fast that its air wake churns the dust on each side.

          They know something's coming. Something fast. Something bad.

          wobbling to a stop, coyote side up.

          still aflame but very much alive. If anything, they seem
          emboldened by the fire. They circle the Ghost Rider, more

          THE GHOST RIDER
          readies his chains. The jaw-beasts attack. Three dozen
          horrors pouncing and GNASHING. The Ghost Rider takes them.-
          Chains, flames, sheer power and force --
          Spines snap. Lupine skulls burn. The Ghost Rider tears the
          monsters limb from limb. The room becomes the Seventh Circle
          of Hell, and at the heart of the Inferno, the Ghost Rider
          exults in the slaughter --
          The whole mission is ablaze now, fire and churning smoke
          consuming everything in its path. Rhymer, Rain, and Tolbein
          run for their lives.

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          Rain, Rhymer and Tolbein are trapped. Fire has cut them off.
          They back their way towards the rear of the building, peer
          out the windows --

                         THEIR POV:
          a hundred foot drop straight down to the highway.

                         TOLBEIN
          There's no way down from here!
          CRACK! The door behind them splinters. The Scarecrow's
          found them once again.

          INT. MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          The Ghost Rider is having difficulty with the jaw-beasts.
          His fire burns them but they just keep coming -- blackened
          skeletal demons, possessed of an unstoppable ferocity --
          For every one he throws aside, two more seem to take its
          place. He can wound them, sear the flesh from their bones,
          but still they pile on, sinking their teeth into his skeletal
          flesh, CRUNCHING through his hollow rib-cage --
          The Ghost Rider SHRIEKS in pain, TEARS one from his back,
          SNAPS another's spine, PUNCHES a fist through a third's
          gnashing muzzle. He falls back through a doorway, onto --

                         A STAIRCASE
          And still, they attack. And now the Ghost Rider is
          weakening. He stumbles on the steps, falls to his knees.
          The fiends pile atop his back --

          Summoning all his power, the Ghost Rider emits a SHOCKWAVE OF
          FLAME, a HEAT-BOMB that blasts the creatures clean off him.

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          The SHOCKWAVE shakes the room. FIRE belches through the
          splintered doorway --
          -- but the Scarecrow scarcely notices. He's flinging dorm
          beds left and right, HOWLING and GROANING as he hunts for --

                         RAIN
          huddled beneath a flimsy bed-frame.

                         SCARECROW

          RAAAAINNN! RAAINN!
          The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds Tolbein. He
          reaches for the man, sinking his spindly finger's into
           Tolbein's chest. Tolbein SCREAMS, instantly shrivelling,
          corroding into dust --
           The Scarecrow hurls aside yet another bed and finds --

                         RHYMER
          aiming his shotgun, point-blank range! BLAM! The BLAST
          Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrow's face.

          INT. MISSION - THE STAIRS - THAT MOMENT

          All Hell breaks loose. The Ghost Rider unleashes wave after
          wave of HELLFIRE, incinerating the hounds as they leap
          towards him, fighting his way up and up the steps --

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          BLAM! Another BLAST chews apart the Scarecrow's neck. The
          monstrosity staggers, then lurches forward, grabbing the
          barrel of the shotgun, instantly corroding it --
          The wave of corrosion swarms up the stock while towards
          Rhymer's hands and he drops the gun, rolling away, scooping
          up Rain as he runs towards the bathroom --

          BACK TO THE SCARECROW,
          recovering, his makeshift flesh knitting itself back together.
          Flames kiss his body, causing sodden particles on his frame to
          SIZZLE and POP -- but because his decayed flesh is so wet, he
          never ignites.

          Enkindled BUZZING bug-ember things swirl around the
          Scarecrow's head in a halo, impossibly alive- He stumbles
          after Rhymer and Rain into

                         THE BATHROOM
          A claustrophobic box of stalls and urinals. Rhymer and Rain
          are nowhere to be seen. Enraged, the Scarecrow tears into
           the stalls, ripping them aside one by one --

          INT. MISSION - THE STAIRS - THAT MOMENT

           The Ghost Rider advances, hurling jaw-beasts left and right --

          INT. MISSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The Scarecrow rends the last stall asunder, finds Rain and
          Rhymer cowering like bugs. He looms above Rain, beetle-
          fingers clutching, flashing a rotted rictus-grin --

                         SCARECROW

          -- GOT YOU'.

                         RED-HOT CHAINS
          whip viciously around the Scarecrow's sodden head and torso.
          He's wrenched backwards, hauled out of the bathroom and
          SLAMMED across the dormitory into the opposite wall --

          EXT. MISSION - NIGHT

          The wall fractures. Debris falls, tumbling hundreds of feet
          down to the highway below.

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          The Scarecrow recovers, SEES the room ablaze. SEES a swathe
          of blackened, twitching jaw-beast skeletons leading from the
          doorway to --

          THE GHOST RIDER
          At the other end of the chains. More accurately,

          GHOST BLAZE,
          battered and weakened, staggering. His flames are barely
          flickering, his bony flesh has become chalky and brittle.
          He's holding a jaw-beast skeleton, drops it to the floor --
          The Scarecrow attacks. Hand-to-hand combat. Massive blows
          and blocks. The burning room SHUDDERS with each impact --

          Ghost Blaze uses his chains, but he's weak, and Scarecrow
          turns them back on him, SMASHES him against the walls. More
           structural fractures, more dust --

          EXT. MISSION - NIGHT

          The whole mission quakes. A huge hole in the wall falls
          open, the Scarecrow barely manages to stop himself falling
          The stilt-like support columns bearing the weight of the
          overhanging mission begin to CREAK and bend. Some snap --

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          The dormitory drops alarmingly, ten feet or more, the
          flooring canting precariously. Ghost Blaze stumbles, falls --
          WHAM! Scarecrow grabs Ghost Blaze's neck. Squeezes tight.
          A WAVE OF DECAY AND CORROSION spreads over Ghost Blaze. He
          SCREAMS, his flesh putrefying, but Scarecrow will not let go --

          ON RAIN AND RHYMER
          Desperate for escape, the flames closing in on them. There's
          nowhere to go. Except a small HATCH, high up in the ceiling --

          BACK TO SCENE
          Ghost Blaze HOWLS, in agony as the Scarecrow's superior evil
          dominates. He feebly extends a hand towards the flames
          nearby, trying to compel the fire to him. The flames twist,
          briefly bend in his direction. The Ghost Rider HOWLS with
          frustration. He needs the flames. He will die without them.
          He tries again, reaching, reaching --

                         THE FLAMES
          surrounding the two foes are starting to bend in earnest now,
          streaming towards Ghost Blaze's bony, begging fingertips
          The Scarecrow is oblivious. Just keeps pouring more misery

          into Ghost Blaze. Then --
          Nuclear silence.
          An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch --
          An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom --
          Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now he's more than the
          Ghost Rider. He's a white-hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating
          with volcanic heat.
          And he DETONATES. An apocalyptic release that --
          obliterates Scarecrow --
          sends Rhymer ducking for cover --
          bulges the dormitory's fractured walls and ceiling,
          lifting the ATTIC FLOOR mightily. HURLING Rain into the air!

          Ghost Blaze lies GROANING at blackened ground zero. He's
          almost human now, spent. Charred timbers CREAK and GROAN

          collapse.

          SCREAMS, struggles --
          -- and forces the Demon away,
          Now he's just Blaze, weak with exertion, but triumphant for

          skull. It rolls, SMASHES against a tree, crumbles to dust.
           Blaze looks up just then, HEARS the sound of ---

                         STARKE'S CADILLAC
           It slows to a stop at the end of the drive, ENGINE RUMBLING.
           Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey.
           Blaze braces himself. A silent inhalation of breath. Rain
          stares, paralyzed by fear --
          The driver's door opens. A hulking silhouette steps out.
          The Beast, backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking

          Looks like we've come to the end of the

                         BLAZE
          Guess so.

          Give me the girl and I'll lift the curse.
          Blaze looks down at Rain. This was all he ever wanted. The
          only thing that has kept him going all these years. He
          reaches into his jacket, retrieving a crumpled pack of
          cigarettes. Plucks one out --

                         BLAZE
          She's all yours, Starke --
          -- and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame
          from within himself. He takes a long drag. In the pits of
          his eyes, something glows there -- a kind of lambent
          darkness.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          -- but you'll have to go through me if
          you want her.
          Starke stares into Blaze's eyes. Doesn't like what he SEES.

                         STARKE
          Don't be a fool, Blaze. I'm offering you
          your life back.

                         BLAZE
          That's not a life. And least now one I'm
          interested in living.

                         STARKE
          You think you can control it. You can't.

                         BLAZE
          Guess I'm willing to take my chances.
          Starke nods, accepting defeat. For now. He looks down at

          Blaze and Rain watch him retreat. Presently, a coyote slips
          from shadows, joining him on the road. It--lopes along beside
          him. We watch them disappear over a rise. Then they're
          gone.
          Beat. Rain studies Blaze, reaches for his hand.

          He'll be back.

          BACK AMONGST THE SMOKING RUINS
          We pass broken concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake
          constricting a mouse, an industry of beetles dissecting a
          bird's carcass. Finally, we come to a small, deep cavity --
          and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find --

          WOMAN (V.0.)
          And that's how it ended. With another
          beginning. A kind of balance struck
          between the flame and the fury.

                         BLAZE'S COIN
          balanced perfectly on it's edge. How it fell like that, at
          the heart of the wreckage, is a mystery that will probably
          never be solved.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          A NURSE brings a postcard to a sleeping patient's bedside.
          The patient is ROXANNE, sleeping peacefully, bathed in
          sunlight. The nurse tacks the card to a wall filled with
          many -- dozens and dozens of postcards charting Blaze's
          journey back and forth across the country.
          And we realize now, that Roxanne is the woman who has been
          narrating our tale.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CONTINUED:

          ROXANNE (V.O.)
          And me? I still sleep. Wandering.
          Waiting. Listening to the whispers of
          the dead.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY/NIGHT

          On Blaze, riding hard, as a scorching desert noon TIME-LAPSES
          into night.

          ROXANNE (V.O.)
          The world turns around without me. There
          are sharks. And there are doves. And
          nighttime holds far darker terrors than
          death. But I am never afraid because I
          know that he is out there, somewhere.
          And that someday, somehow --
          Blaze ignites, SCREAMS, hurls back his head --

          ROXANNE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          -- he will return to me.
          -- and the Ghost Rider rockets headlong into black.

ACT ONE
-------
								FADE IN:

EXT. -- A FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT

On the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted
against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON.  The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with
an EERIE SQUEAK.  Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is heard--a cross between a
chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING.

				WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(A CROWING HOWL)

						CAMERA PANS DOWN TO:

CHICKEN PEN

A fenced-in dirt area with numerous CHICKENS milling around, CLUCKING as
they peck at the ground.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(ANOTHER HOWL, nearer now)
		The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.

WERECHICKEN'S POV -- MOVING

A RED-tinted, shaky, MOVING CAMERA TRUCK-IN on the chickens.  (These shots
are in the style of the POV SHOTS in WOLFEN.)  Magnified GURGLING and
HEAVY BREATHING of Werechicken is heard.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)

The terrified chickens stare INTO CAMERA as the Werechicken moves closer,
his shadow falling over them.  They flap into their coop, SQUAWKING
wildly.

INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

MAUDE and ZEKE sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on TV
while munching popcorn from a huge bowl.  They're distracted by CHICKENS
SQUAWKING.

				ZEKE
		Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.

				MAUDE
		Jes' set easy, Zeke.
			(she rises; heads for door)
		I'll take a look-see.

Zeke continues staring at TV.

EXT.  FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT -- WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through the Werechicken's red eyes, we see a distant image of Maude with a
flashlight, approaching the fenced-in chicken pen and opening the gate.
CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN toward Maude as she enters, leaving gate open.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)

ANGLE WITHIN CHICKEN PEN

The dirt compound is empty now as Maude crosses toward wooden chicken
coop.

				MAUDE
			(as she goes)
		Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.

INT.  CHICKEN COOP -- OTS MAUDE

AS Maude ENTERS from OUT OF CAMERA, her flashlight beam illuminates the
chickens cowering on their roosts in a corner.  They CLUCK nervously.

				MAUDE
		What's got you girls so durned upset?
		There a coyote sneakin' 'round?

Suddenly the Werechicken's shadow moves up Maude's back, then the wall.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(Low, gutteral CLU-UCK)

Maude looks over her shoulder AT CAMERA, reacts.

				MAUDE
			(GASP!)

MAUDE'S POV -- THE WERECHICKEN

Red-eyed, grotesque, three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it
stands framed in the moonlit doorway.  It opens its fanged beak in a
horrifying SHRIEK as it springs AT CAMERA, wings flapping.

				WERECHICKEN
			(Frightening SHRIEK)

INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - CLOSE ON TV

Old black-and-white movie.  MELODRAMATIC MUSIC as a man turns into a
werewolf, his HOWL a continuation of the previous Werechicken SHRIEK.

				TV WEREWOLF
			(eerie HOWL)

WIDER ANGLE - ZEKE

continues watching TV and eating popcorn.  Maude walks stiffly into room
behind him, eyes staring blankly.

				ZEKE
			(without looking up)
		Everythin' okay out there, Maude?

WAIST SHOT -- MAUDE

She stares with glassy, red eyes and CLUCKS quietly.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(CLUCKS)

				ZEKE (VO)
		What say?

PAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken
from the feet up.  First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet
sprout.  Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered
body underneath. The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron.  One
foot scratches the floor.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
			(more CLUCKS)

WIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKEN

Now completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on
back of couch, THRUSTING her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl
in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean.  Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless,
as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken.  The
Werechicken looks up from the empty bowl, right in Zeke's terrified eyes.

				ZEKE
			(SCREAMS)

He scrambles backwards off the couch.

EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT - WERECHICKEN'S POV

SCENE RED-tinted.   We hear loud SQUAWKING from within house as chicken
feathers fly out the open windows.

				ZEKE (VO)
			(YELLING)
		Get away!' Scat!  Shoo!

				MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
			(loud SQUAWKING)

CLOSE ANGLE -- WERECHICKEN

Watching from slight hilltop.  Its beak seems to bend into an insidious
grin.

				ZEKE (VO)
			(from distance)
		Help!... He-elp!

								CUT TO:

EXT.  ESTABLISHING -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - NIGHT

As CAMERA MOVES IN, we hear:

				PETER (VO)
		Egon, could you hold off on the weather
		balloon bit for a minute?

							DISSOLVE THRU TO:

INT. -- LABORATORY -- ON PETER AND RAY

They stand holding big plastic bags of trash, obviously annoyed at the
O.S. Egon.  Ray's armful of trash is piled so high that he can't see over
it.  SLIMER hovers behind, sticking his nose in one of the bags like a
dog.  He finally dives right into it.

				PETER (CONT)
		It's Your night to take out the trash.

				RAY
		And Winston's in the kitchen doing your
		dishes.

ANGLE ON EGON

He's busy testing his WEATHER BALLOON--a large, pink bubble half the size
of the room.  He moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon
rises.

				EGON
			(preoccupied; through above)
		Be with you in ...
			(checks watch)
		...one minute, fifty-three seconds.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Peter and Ray exchange pained glances.  Peter awkwardly attempts to pick
up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked.  PAN
WITH THEM as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly
lowers INTO FRAME.  They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash
bags flying.

				PETER AND RAY
			(AD-LIB REACTIONS as they
			bounce off balloon)

NEW ANGLE

Peter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags.
Slimer SQUEALS from within it.

				SLIMER (VO)
			(big muffled SQUEAL)

Then he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body
flat as a Frisbee.

SLIMER

shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter.

				PETER
			(pissed; sarcastic)
		Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!

				SLIMER
		Sorreee!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray helps Peter up as the telephone RINGS and RINGS.

				RAY
			(irritated)
		Egon!  The phone!

ON EGON

The RINGING phone is right beside him on the workbench.

				EGON
			(preoccupied with remote
			controls)
		In a minute, Ray.

ANGLE ON WINSTON

He ENTERS with sleeves rolled up, wiping a plate with a dish towel and
wearing an apron.

				WINSTON
			(sarcastic)
		Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to
		strain yourself.
			(picks up phone)
		Ghostbusters Central.

				VOICE OVER PHONE
			(excited CHATTER)

				WINSTON
		Calm down... Where are you?...
			(a BEAT as he listens)
		We'll be right there.

He hangs up.

WIDER ANGLE

Peter and Ray again have their arms full of trash bags.  Even Slimer is
dragging one.

				WINSTON
		Ready for this one?  Some farmer says his
		wife was eaten by a giant chicken.

				PETER
		Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds
		better than doing Egon's chores.
			(he drops trash bags)
		Let's roll!

Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and EXIT with Peter and
Winston.

REAR VIEW ON EGON

still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room.

				EGON
		I think I've finally perfected it.  Watch
		this, guys.
			(a BEAT, he looks around
			over shoulder)
		Guys?

								WIPE TO:

EXT. -- COUNTRY ROAD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

ECTO-1 roars INTO CAMERA, siren and lights going.

INT. -- ECTO 1 -- MOVING

The Ghostbusters, minus Egon, are wearing their gear.  Slimer hovers in
back seat.

				RAY
		It sure feels strange not having Egon with
		us.

				PETER
			(sarcastic)
		Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's
		not with us.

ON WINSTON

Driving.

				WINSTON
		But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells
		that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be
		a rich man!

ON PETER

Arms folded, grumpily.

				PETER
		Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his
		share of the chores.

EXT. -- ECTO 1 -- NIGHT

As it speeds OUT OF CAMERA toward distant farmhouse, PAN OVER TO the
apron-wearing Maude-Chicken silhouetted in the moonlight, nesting in a
haystack.  MOVE IN TO --

CLOSER ANGLE ON MAUDE-CHICKEN

Her body starts to shake, she ruffles her wings.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(Egg-laying CLUCKS)

Then she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack, revealing an
enormous egg beneath her.  Maude SQUAWKS and CLUCKS and struts off into a
cornfield, pecking away at ears of corn.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(SQUAWKS and CLUCKS)

								CUT TO:

INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Ray, Winston and Slimer listen seriously as Zeke speaks, but Peter's
obviously not buying it.

				ZEKE
		Had big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest
		dang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet
		tall.

Peter rolls his eyes.

				WINSTON
		Shouldn't be hard to find.

RAY

is jotting info on notepad.

				RAY
		Did it have any distinguishing marks?

ANOTHER ANGLE

				PETER
		Ray!  It's six feet tall!

Peter grabs Ray's arm, starts ushering him to front door.

				PETER (CONT)
			(over shoulder as he goes)
		Thank you, Sir.  We'll put out a missing
		chicken report right away.

EXT.  FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

As the three Ghostbusters and Slimer cross toward Ecto-1 parked in front.

				PETER
			(as they go)
		This one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been
		watchin' too many horror movies and eating
		too much greasy popcorn.

CLOSER ANGLE -- MOVING

				RAY
		No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a
		bonafide werechicken here.

CLOSER ANGLE

Peter and Winston stop, look at Ray in disbelief.

				WINSTON
		A werechicken?

				PETER
		Get serious, Ray.

				RAY
		Then explain those!

Ray points at ground.  Peter, Winston and Slimer look down.

THEIR POV

Peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints.

							SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. -- OPEN FIELD -- NIGHT

The three Ghostbusters follow Maude's "chicken" tracks with powerful
flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks.  Slimer moves ahead,
nose to ground like a bloodhound.

				SLIMER
			(SNIFFS as he goes)

ANGLE ON SLIMER

He floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him
right into the haystack.  We hear a BONK from within, then:

				SLIMER (VO)
		Ow!

Slimer backs OUT INTO SHOT rubbing his head.  He looks up and his eyes pop
wide.

				SLIMER
			(amazed GASP!)

LOW ANGLE ON GIANT EGG

The Ghostbusters ENTER SHOT and play their flashlights across the huge egg
sitting atop the haystack.

				RAY
			(excited)
		What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken
		egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!

WIDER ANGLE

As Ray and Winston ease the egg down off the haystack.  Peter holds his
PKE meter up to it.

				PETER
		Look, if this is a werechicken egg,

CLOSER ANGLE -- METER

Nothing registers on the meter.

				PETER (CONT)
		...how come there's no PKE reading?

THREESHOT

Ray and Winston still hold giant egg.

				RAY
			(looking at meter in
			Peter's hand)
		I dunno... that is strange.

				WINSTON
		Let's get it back to Headquarters and run
		some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some
		answers.

ON RAY

				RAY
		Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken
		that laid this has gotta be around here
		someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.

ON PETER AND SLIMER

				PETER
			(throws up his hands with
			heavy SIGH)
		I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer.

They take egg from Ray and Winston and start back toward Ecto-l.

				PETER  (CONT)
			(shaking his head; as he
			goes)
		Werechickens.

WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through its RED EYES we see, from a distance, Peter and Slimer carrying
the egg, Ray and Winston moving off in other direction.

				WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(BREATHING & SLOBBERING)

							SMASH CUT TO:

INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - LAB - NIGHT

Egon still busy with his balloon as Peter and Slimer carry egg in through
door.

				PETER
			(through above)
		Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work
		for you:  How about analyzing this?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Egon looks around, reacts to egg.

				EGON
		Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg
		I've ever seen.

Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk.

				PETER
		I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've
		had a long night in a not-too-fragrant
		barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting
		the sheets.

Peter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in
hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly.  Egon pushes glasses up off tip of
nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it.  CAMERA MOVES IN on
egg and we --

							MATCH-DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. -- FULL MOON IN COUNTRY SKY -- NIGHT

CAMERA PANS DOWN from full moon to reveal the tiny figures of Ray and
Winston approaching an old barn.  They stop, shining their flashlights on
closed main door.

				WINSTON
			(tired)
		Ray, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there
		really isn't any...

				RAY
			(holds up one hand)
		Shh!

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray extends his PKE meter toward barn.  It BEEPS incessantly.

				RAY
			(low voice)
		It's in there.

				WINSTON
			(unclipping his blaster)
		Then let's get it!

INT. BARN -- HIGH ANGLE ON MAIN DOOR -- WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through its RED EYES we see the barn door slowly CREAK open, revealing Ray
and Winston peering in.

CLOSER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON

They ENTER cautiously, Ray holding his BEEPING meter out before him.  The
barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and
the beams of their flashlights.  As the WIND picks up, WOOD CREAKS, HAY
RUSTLES, and a piece of JUNKY machinery turns with a SQUEAL.

				WINSTON
			(WHISPER)
		Man, this place is creepy.

				RAY
			(WHISPER)
		It's in here -- I can feel it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Suddenly the door SLAMS shut behind them and the FLAP OF BEATING WINGS
SCURRIES through the darkness.  Winston JUMPS.

				WINSTON
		Look out!

Ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts.  Its beam catches a couple of
startled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers WHISTLING.

REACTION SHOT -- RAY AND WINSTON

				RAY & WINSTON
			(relieved SIGHS)

WERECHICKEN'S POV

RED-TINTED, moving slowly toward Ray and Winston from behind.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HEAVY BREATHING)

CLOSE ON RAY AND WINSTON

They stop as PKE meter starts BEEPING.  Ray checks the reading.

				RAY
			(whisper)
		Something's close.  Very close.

WERECHICKEN'S POV

Closing on Ray and Winston.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HEAVY BREATHING)

The guys wheel around.

THEIR POV ON WERECHICKEN

We see only its face.  The blood-red eyes stare menacingly, its fanged
beak slightly open and drooling.

				WERECHICKEN
			(HEAVY RASPY BREATHING)

ZOOM BACK TO --

WIDER ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It hops forward into a streak of moonlight.  It's three feet tall, its
wings hang out at the sides, and its evil, blood-red eyes stare at CAMERA.

				WERECHICKEN  (CONT)
			(HEAVY PANTING)

				RAY (VO)
		It is a werechicken!

ANGLE ON RAY and WINSTON

Backing away, blasters leveled.

				WINSTON
		Man, he is ugly!

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It postures, rooster-like and:

				WERECHICKEN
			(ROARS angrily)

ON RAY and WINSTON

Still backing up.

				RAY
		Bad choice of words, Winston.

THE WERECHICKEN suddenly leaps AT CAMERA.

				WERECHICKEN
			(loud SHRIEKING SQUAWK)

WERECHICKEN'S POV

ZOOM-IN on Winston and Ray.  They open fire.

FULL SHOT

The proton streams catch the Werechicken in mid-air as it vaults toward
Ray and Winston, halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton
energy.

				WERECHICKEN
			(SHRIEKS)

A HIDEOUS SPIRIT rises from its writhing body -- shapeless, but with
monstrous glowing eyes and fangs.  The spirit lets out a ROAR more
frightening than the Werechicken howl.

				SPIRIT
			(big ROAR)

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray, still firing his gun, snaps a trap loose from his belt, and tosses it
onto the barn floor.  It POPS open.

				RAY
		Trap out!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray and Winston, struggling with the writhing Spirit caught in the
streams, guide the Spirit into the trap.

				WINSTON
		Hang on!  That's it!

				RAY
		We've almost got him!

CLOSE ON TRAP

The Spirit is sucked into the trap, which SLAMS shut.

WIDER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON

A normal chicken with singed feathers stands where the Werechicken was.
It CLUCKS, starts pecking at the dirt.

				CHICKEN
			(Normal CLUCKING)

				RAY
			(looking at chicken)
		Well, that takes care of one werechicken.

CLOSER ON THE GUYS

Ray picks up the smoking trap.

				RAY (CONT)
		Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's
		wife.

They head for the door.  Winston stops.

				WINSTON
		Ray, I just had a thought...

Ray pauses to look around at Winston.

				WINSTON (CONT)
		What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's
		wife?

And off their looks, we --

								CUT TO:

INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ -KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Egon carries the big egg into kitchen, Slimer helping.

				EGON
			(straining)
		Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't
		have time to examine this egg tonight.  I
		have to prepare for my weather balloon
		demonstration tomorrow morning.

ANOTHER ANGLE

With his elbow, Egon opens refrigerator with and the two of them place the
giant egg inside.

				EGON (CONT)
			(through above)
		But it'll be safe in here.

				SLIMER
		Yeah.

Egon closes fridge.

				SLIMER
			(big YAWN)
		G'night, Egon.

Slimer floats off.

				EGON
		Goodnight, Slimer.

								WIPE TO:

INT. -- BEDROOM

Slimer is SNORING, hovering above Peter's empty bed.

				SLIMER
			(SNORING)

CLOSE ON SLIMER

In a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food
dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' "LA BAMBA" a la the
California Raisins in "I Heard It Through The Grapevine."  Still asleep,
Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and
pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS
the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up.
Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy.

				SLIMER
		Fooooood.

He zips o.s.

INT. -- KITCHEN

Dark.  Lights go on, then Slimer SKIDS to mid-air stop and whips open
fridge.  His eyes pop as he sees the egg.

				SLIMER
			(licking his lips)
		Yummy!

Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg
drives Slimer straight to the floor.  The egg bounces on his stomach twice
before he gets a grip on it.  Straining his little green brains out, he
floats the egg up into the air and o.s.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS, then GRUNTS)

ANGLE ON OVEN

Slimer shoves egg in the open oven, closes door, turns on the heat, then
moves O.S.  The oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver.

ON SLIMER

Slimer HUMS as he busily sets table for one:  placemat, a plate, utensils,
salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish, ... a flurry of activity
that all focuses on his personal eating spot.

				SLIMER
			(HUMMING through above)

ANGLE ON OVEN

Through window we see the egg shake and then begin to crack open.

RESUME ON SLIMER

Hovering at table, still preparing for feast.  He puts on a bib, unaware
of oven shaking behind him.

				SLIMER
			(still HUMMING)

With a loud BANG, the oven practically explodes and the door flies off.
Out pops a BABY WERECHICKEN, SNARLING and CACKLING.

				BABY WERECHICKEN
			(SNARLING, CACKLING)

ON SLIMER

His eyes bug and his paw drops.

				SLIMER
			(startled SCREAM)

Slimer barrels up through sink faucet, leaving his bib stuck in the
opening.

INT. -- SHOWER

Peter shampooing his hair.

				PETER
			(AD LIB SINGING)

Slimer comes shooting out through shower nozzle, hugs Peter tightly around
the neck and scaring the hell out of him.

				PETER
			(startled YELL; then:)
		Slimer!  How 'bout some privacy??

				SLIMER
			(pointing, eyes wide)
		Monster!  Inna kitchen!

				PETER
		Monster?

				SLIMER
			(nods)
		Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!
			(imitates werechicken)
			(SNARLING & CACKLING)

INT. -- LAB

Egon works at his table.  A now familiar Werechicken shadow appears over
his shoulder and grows up the wall.

CLOSER ANGLE - REAR VIEW ON EGON

Werechicken creeps OUT OF CAMERA, bites Egon on the rear and pulls back
o.s., chicken claws CLATTERING off into distance.

				EGON
			(looking around)
		Ow!

				BABY WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(CACKLING fading into
			distance)

ON EGON

Dazed, he looks down at his feet.

CLOSE ON EGON'S SHOES

Chicken toes pop through the leather, one at a time.

				EGON (VO)
			(dazed)
		What?

CLOSE SHOTS

As Egon's transformation continues:  His coveralls RIP apart at the legs,
then midriff, then his arms turn into wings.  Finally, a beak sprouts from
his face.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(Weird CLUCK)

							SMASH CUT TO:

INT. HALL OUTSIDE LAB -- NIGHT

Peter (now dressed and wearing his backpack) runs up to lab door and
flings it open, Slimer right behind him.

INT. LAB

Peter and Slimer look in, not seeing Egon, who is now a six-foot-tall
werechicken, but still wearing his glasses, standing behind door.

				PETER
			(CALLS)
		Egon?
			(to Slimer)
		Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here
		that looks like a monster.

The Egon-Chicken jumps out right in front of Peter and Slimer.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(CHICKEN HOWL)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Slimer freaks and rockets right through the nearest wall.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS as he goes)

				PETER
		Holy cow!!

Peter raises his proton gun.

CLOSE ON EGON-CHICKEN

He flaps his wings wildly, his red eyes bulging, and GROWLS, revealing
impressive fangs.

				EGON-CHICKEN

INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS LAB -- NIGHT

Egon the Werechicken moves toward Peter, fangs bared in attack mode.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(SNARLING as he goes)

ON PETER

He steps back into doorway, blaster leveled at Egon-Chicken, and SNAPS on
the power.  It HUMS to life.

				PETER
			(horrified)
		What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!

				RAY (VO)
		Peter!  Wait!

A hand grabs Peter by the arm fust as the thrower fires, sending the
proton stream off at an angle into ceiling, barely missing the chicken.

				PETER
			(surprised as he looks
			around)
		Hey!

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LAB

as Ray pulls Peter out into corridor, Winston kicks door shut in the
Egon-Chicken's snarling face and quickly locks it.  Slimer hovers nearby
looking worried.

				EGON-CHICKEN (VO)
			(SNARLS)

CLOSE ANGLE

The door SHAKES and SHUDDERS as the unseen Egon-Chicken tries to break
through.

				PETER
			(irritated; through above)
		What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate
		Egon!

				RAY
		Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he
		was bitten and now he's a werechicken!

The door behind them is starting to splinter and bulge from the battering
of the Egon-Chicken.

				PETER
			(looking at door)
		You're kidding!
			(a BEAT, then)
		Come to think of it, there was a certain
		resemblance.

Suddenly the battering stops.

				WINSTON
			(looking toward door)
		What happened?  He's so quiet all of a
		sudden.

ON RAY

Looking toward o.s. window, he reacts.

				RAY
		It's the moon!

He hurries o.s.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray stops at window, looks out.  Beyond we see the full moon.  Peter,
Winston and Slimer come up behind him.

				RAY (CONT)
		Tonight's the first --

CLOSE ON MOON

It's beginning to disappear, right to left.

				RAY (VO)(CONT)
		-- lunar eclipse in ten years!

ON GHOSTBUSTERS AND SLIMER

All looking out window as eclipse continues

				PETER
		Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being
		a chicken?

				RAY
			(turning to others)
		Werechickens only appear during a full
		moon, and for the next few minutes, the
		moon's not full.

INT. LAB -- ON DOOR

Door opens and Ray pecks in.

				RAY
			(tentative)
		Egon?

ANGLE ON EGON

Seen from the waist up (he's not wearing clothes), looking around,
confused.  He sees Ray.

				EGON
		Ray, what is going on?

WIDER ANGLE

Egon is holding his tattered coveralls in front of his waist, like a
skirt.

				EGON (CONT)
		And why am I naked?

Suddenly Slimer flies INTO SHOT and gives Egon a big, sloppy kiss.

				SLIMER
			(as he enters)
		Egon!
			(KISSING SOUNDS)

ON PETER AND WINSTON

				PETER
		Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and
		some bad news.

				EGON
			(as he sits)
		Bad news first.

				WINSTON
		You've been turned into a werechicken!

ON EGON

His glasses slip to the end of his nose as his eyes widen.  He pushes them
back up.

				EGON
		A werechicken?

ON RAY

He hurriedly thumbs through the TOBIN SPIRIT GUIDE.

				RAY
			(flipping through book)
		Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens!
			(reads)
		"The werechicken appears during the full
		moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into
		another werechicken."
			(he looks at Egon)
		That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...

ON EGON

He rubs his rear.

				EGON
			(through above)
		I remember the bite clearly.  How long will
		I stay like this?

ON RAY, WINSTON and PETER

Looking at the Tobin Guide.

				RAY
			(looking in Tobin's Guide)
		According to this, there is an antidote.
		But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse
		only lasts three minutes!

INT. FIREHOUSE KITCHEN

Slimer scrambles through the cupboard, grabbing various bottles of stuff,
and hands them to Winston who adds ingredients to mixing bowl and stirs
while Ray reads from Tobin's Guide.

				RAY
			(reading through above)
		"One tablespoon paprika, one clove of
		garlic, some parsley for color, cup of
		gelatin..."

ANGLE ON WINDOW

Through it we see the eclipsed moon starting to emerge from shadow.

INT. LAB -- ANGLE ON EGON

His pupils look constricted and he's perspiring.

				EGON
			(weakly)
		I don't feel well.

Peter steps INTO SHOT, puts arm around Egon's shoulders.

				PETER
			(through above)
		Take it easy, Egon.  You're gonna be fine.
			(SHOUTS O.S.; worried)
		Hurry it up, guys!

INT.  KITCHEN -- ON WINSTON AND RAY

				RAY
			(reading hurriedly)
		"And one tablespoon of chickenbane."

ON SLIMER

He rummages through shelves, then looks down at Ray.

				SLIMER
			(aghast)
		No chickenbane!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray and winston exchange panicky looks.

				RAY
		Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!

They run OUT with the mixing bowl of liquid.  Slimer follows.

INT. LAB -- CLOSE ON EGON'S LEGS

They're once again turning into chicken legs and chicken feet.  Toes
popping out like popcorn.

				PETER (VO)
			(YELLS)
		Come on, Ray!!

WIDER ANGLE

As Peter and Egon stare down at the chicken legs and chicken feet.

				PETER  (CONT)
			(YELLS o.s.)
		He's changing again!

Ray, Slimer and Winston rush INTO SHOT.

				RAY
			(breathless)
		Quick, Egon, drink this!

Winston hands the bowl of potion to Egon, who gulps it down.

				EGON
			(swallowing, GULPING
			sounds)

As Egon drinks, his arms transform into wings and he drops the bowl,
breaking it.

				WINSTON
		We're too late!

CLOSER -- EGON

As the transformation  and feathers  rise up  his shoulders.  Suddenly,
the transformation  stops at  the neck.   DRAMATIC MUSIC STOPS, too.

ON PETER, RAY, WINSTON AND SLIMER

They stare, wide-eyed.  After A BEAT --

				PETER
		What happened?

WIDER ANGLE

To include Egon, who is once again a six-foot-tall chicken, but with
Egon's own neck and head.

				RAY
		The potion only partly worked, because of
		the missing chickenbane.

				PETER
		Well, we hafta do something!

				EGON
		Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter.
		There's a logical solution to every problem.

				BABY WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWL)

CLOSER ANGLE

Strands of slime stand straight up on the nape of Slimer's "neck" at the
sound -- like a frightened cat -- and he dives into a test tube in a rack
on Egon's workbench.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS as he goes)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

looking around.

				WINSTON
		What was that?

				RAY
		The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still
		out there somewhere.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				PETER
			(to others)
		Let's stop that thing before it makes
		drumsticks out of anyone else!
			(to Egon)
		Un, no offense, Egon.

The three normal Ghostbusters dash toward door.

							SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. -- AERIAL VIEW -- MANHATTAN -- NIGHT

ECTO-2 glides over the city, running lights blinking.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter at the controls.  Slimer sits beside him, looking down at the city
through binoculars.

				PETER
			(into radio mike)
		All quiet on the chicken front.  How about
		down there?

INT. -- ECTO-1 -- MOVING

Winston driving.  Ray on the radio.

				RAY
		Not a peep.

				WINSTON
			(gives Ray a dirty look)
		No pun intended.

EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Several people run out front door SCREAMING as ECTO-1 passes.

				PEOPLE
			(SCREAMING as they exit)

INT. -- ECTO-1 - MOVING

Winston and Ray look back at exiting people.

				WINSTON
		That's it!

Winston cranks the wheel.

EXT.  ECTO-1

As it makes a SCREECHING U-turn.

EXT. -- SUPERMARKET

Ecto-1 SKIDS up, doors open, and Ray and Winston leap out, blasters at the
ready, running toward store entrance.

INT. -- SUPERMARKET

Ray and winston run in and stop inside door beside a panicked BOX BOY who
points o.s.

				BOX BOY
			(breathless)
		It's in there!  A big chicken!  It's gotta
		be ten feet tall!

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray and Winston exchange glances.

				WINSTON
		Ten feet tall?

				BOX BOY
			(nods)
		Maybe fifteen, I dunno.  Big!
			(he runs o.s.)
		I'm outta here!

				RAY
			(to Winston)
		Let's split up.

They run off in opposite directions, flanking the long aisles.

ON RAY

PAN WITH him as he cautiously moves along, aisle by aisle.  At far end of
aisles, Winston can be seen doing the same.  The market is thrashed,
spilled groceries everywhere.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As they reach the last aisle.  No chicken.  Ray joins Winston.

				WINSTON
		How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall
		chicken?

				BUTCHER (VO)
			(frightened SCREAM)

				RAY
		We didn't!  Come on!

They hurry o.s.

INT. MEAT DEPT. -- ON BUTCHER

He's hiding under his butcher block, trembling.  Ray and Winston run INTO
SHOT.  The Butcher looks up, eyes wide.

				BUTCHER
		A giant chicken just came through here --
		it was thirty feet tall!

CLOSER ANGLE

				WINSTON
		Thirty feet tall?

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Butcher is pointing out open door.  Beyond is a parking lot with a
trail of crushed cars right down the middle.

				BUTCHER (CONT)
		Yeah!  Look what it did to those cars!

Ray and Winston race out the door.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - WIDE ON ECTO-2 FLYING -- NIGHT

The little chopper, lights blinking, skims low past three-and four-story
buildings.

				PETER (VO)
			(into radio)
		It's how big?  Okay, Ray, I admit you were
		right about these Werechickens,...

INT.  ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter and Slimer, as before.

				PETER (CONT)
		...but I definitely don't buy them growing
		to the size of buildings.

				SLIMER
		(covers mouth, LAUGHTER FIZZING
		through his closed, flapping lips.
		"How absurd.")

Suddenly, the head of the Werechicken rears up INTO SHOT right in front of
Ray and Slimer.

				SLIMER
			(SCREAMS)

				WERECHICKEN
			(deafening HOWL)

ECTO-2 is buffeted about by the howl as Peter jams the stick forward.

WIDER ON ECTO-2

It makes a steep, banking dive and gets the hell out of there, barely
escaping the big Werechicken's beak that SNAPS shut on thin air just
behind Ecto-2's retreating tail.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter is shaken, but in control.  Slimer is trembling like green Jell-O.

				PETER
			(into mike)
		Ray, you were right!  The chicken's here,
		and he's a walking high-rise!

INT. -- ECTO-1 -- NIGHT -- MOVING

				RAY
			(into radio)
		On our way, Peter.

Winston floors it and he and Ray accelerate forward INTO CAMERA.

INT. BUNKROOM -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - MORNING

Egon is "perched" on the window sill, looking pensively out at the city,
still a chicken from the neck down.  A BEAT, then:

				JANINE (VO)
			(big SCREAM)

				EGON
			(startled CLUCK)

Startled, Egon flutters up off the sill, gravity takes over, and he lands
on his feathered butt.

WIDER ANGLE

Revealing Janine standing frozen in the doorway, eyes wide with disbelief,
hands to her cheeks.

				JANINE
		Egon!  What happened?

				EGON
		It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my
		coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board
		in forty-five...
			(CLUCK)
		...minutes.

ON JANINE

She stares at Egon, totally bewildered.

				JANINE
		But what ...?
			(thinks better of asking)
		Nevermind.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Janine takes a long yellow raincoat off a door hook and helps him into it.
He's completely covered except for his head and feet.

				JANINE
		Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like
		-- this?

				EGON
		Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least.

ANGLE ON EGON

As he struts toward the door, we see his tail protruding through a slit in
the back of coat.  He EXITS, CLUCKING.

				EGON
			(CLUCKING as he goes)

CLOSE JANINE

Staring after him in disbelief.

EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN -- ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It walks along stepping on cars, kicking over telephone poles, etc., a la
Godzilla.  The streets SHAKE.  Panicky pedestrians flee the Werechicken's
giant feet.

				CROWD
			(panicky WALLA)

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter and Slimer are following giant chicken.

				PETER
			(into radio)
		It's heading down 34th toward the Empire
		State Building.

EXT. -- THE STREETS -- DAWN

Ecto-1 SPEEDS around a corner, SIREN blaring.

				RAY (VO)
		Check!  We're almost there.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BLDG. -- DAWN

Sun rises behind the werechicken as it approaches in distance.  With each
HOWL, the streets SHAKE.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWLS)

LOW ANGLE ON ECTO-1

Approaching CAMERA fast, it SCREECHES to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Ray and
Winston LEAP out, open fire, their proton streams angling upward.

LOW ANGLE POV - WERECHICKEN

Moving toward them down the concrete canyon, flattening street lamps and
power poles.  Ecto-2 can be seen flying above and behind it.  The proton
streams are up toward it.

INT. ECTO-2

				PETER
		Take over, Slimer!

				SLIMER
		Roger!

Slimer grabs the control stick in both hands as Peter leans out to one
side with his blaster and fires downward.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

Caught in the three crossing streams.  It FLAILS about, knocking over
street lights and bashing in the sides of buildings, and lets out a
deafening HOWL.  A MONSTROUS SPIRIT emerges from its body and fills the
screen like a transparent film.

				WERECHICKEN
			(enraged HOWLS)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

Ray tosses out the trap.

				RAY
		Let's reel him in!

WIDER ANGLE

As Ray, Winston and Peter's beams draw the Spirit toward the trap.

				SPIRIT
			(angry HOWLS)

CLOSER ON TRAP

Ray's boot stomps on trigger and trap springs open.  As the Spirit comes
into contact with the trap a small STORM ERUPTS around it.  SPARKS and
LIGHTNING BOLTS fly.  A HURRICANE-like WIND BLOWS.

ON RAY AND WINSTON

Being buffeted by wind, struggling to hang onto their throwers as they
continue firing.  They have to SHOUT over the NOISE.

				WINSTON
			(loud)
		Trap's full!  Somebody forgot to empty it!

ON ECTO-2

The wind is really bouncing it around.  Slimer has his hands full, while
Peter continues shooting.

				RAY
			(YELLS)
		Whose job was it?

RAY AND WINSTON

turn to each other.

				RAY AND WINSTON
		EGON'S!

CLOSE ON TRAP

Light FLASHES rapidly.  Trap begins to shake and glow.

				RAY (VO)
		It's gonna blow!

LOW ANGLE -- ECTO-2

				WINSTON (VO)
			(over walkie-talkie)
		Peter, get outa here!

It banks, gets the hell away.

RAY AND WINSTON

turn off their proton guns and are KNOCKED down by the released force as
the freed Monstrous Spirit whooshes skyward.  The STORM abruptly
disappears, as if SUCKED up.  The trap stops shaking and SNAPS shut.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

As the Spirit POPS back into its body, JARRING it.  Its chicken face
contorts with new ANGER.

				WERECHICKEN
			(HOWLS)

WIDER ANGLE

It turns and starts up the side of the Empire State Building.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MORNING

The werechicken is halfway to the top.  PULL BACK to reveal Peter, Slimer,
Winston and Ray standing in street looking up at him.  Ecto-1 and 2 are
behind them.

				PETER
		So how're we gonna, put that big bird on
		ice, guys'

				RAY
			(SNAPS finger)
		Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken
		freezes at very low temperatures!

CLOSER ANGLE

				WINSTON
		Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot
		chicken in August?

A BEAT, then the three guys look at each other.

				RAY, WINSTON & PETER
		Egon's weather balloon!

EXT. -- BUILDING ROOFTOP -- MORNING

Not far from the Empire State Building.  Egon stands before a group of
seated MEN and WOMEN --THE WEATHER BOARD -- in his rain coat.  To one
side, the weather balloon hovers above them.

				EGON
		Distinguished members of the Weather Board,
		my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu-
		capability --

ANGLE ON EGON

The top of the Empire State Building is visible behind him as he holds the
small weather device control box in one winged hand.

				EGON (CONT)
		... of entering the upper atmosphere where
		clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.

ANGLE ON BOARD MEMBERS

They look at each other, puzzled.

				BOARD
			(puzzled MUTTERING WALLA)

RESUME ON EGON

				EGON (VO)(CONT)
		There, it can electronically alter weather
		cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun,
		rain, or...
			(BAWK!)
		...snow.

Ecto-2 ascends into view behind him and hovers, the chopper's rotors
blowing Egon's raincoat up over his head, exposing the chicken body
underneath.

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Their mouths drop open as they stare at Egon's chicken body.

				BOARD MEMBERS
			(excited WALLA)

ANGLE ON EGON

He pulls raincoat down off his face, holding it in place with one hand as
he looks at audience with forced smile.

				EGON
			(to Board members)
		I, er, can explain this, but --

Slimer flies INTO SHOT beside Egon and WHISPERS in his ear.

				SLIMER
			(WHISPERING MUTTERS)

				EGON
		What?

He looks around to where Slimer is pointing.

EGON'S POV

As the Werechicken climbs into view, scaling the upper stories of the
Empire State Building.

				WERECHICKEN
			(distant SQUAWKS)

NEW ANGLE

The Weather Board members see the Werechicken and start to SCREAM.

				WEATHER BOARD MEMBERS
			(SCREAMING)

ON EGON

He JUMPS onto a rope ladder hanging from Ecto-2 and climbs inside.  Slimer
flies in right behind him and Ecto-2 rises up OUT OF SHOT.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Egon settles into passenger seat.  Slimer hovers behind them.

				PETER
			(loud over engine)
		Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with
		your weather balloons

				EGON
			(holds up wings)
		Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.

				PETER
			(nods)
		Piece of cake.

EXT. -- ECTO-2 -- MORNING

It banks off toward the Empire State Building as the Werechicken reaches
the top of the spire.

ON WERECHICKEN

As it gets "comfortable" on the spire, fluffing its feathers.  It begins
to quiver (like Maude did earlier when she laid an egg).

				WERECHICKEN
			(hideous CROW)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

On street below, looking skyward through binoculars.

				WINSTON
		What's it doing?

				RAY
		It looks like it's about to lay an --

Winston puts a hand over Ray's mouth.

				WINSTON
			(with dread)
		I don't want to hear it.

ANGLE ON WEATHER BALLOON

It rises from weather bureau rooftop, then drifts along horizontally, away
from the Empire State Building.  It stops, then begins to rise again.  The
sky darkens as the balloon rises into the clouds.

INT. ECTO-2 - MOVING

Peter, Egon, Slimer, as before.  Peter operates the weather balloon
control box while Slimer flies the chopper.

				EGON
		Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position.
		Turn the lever to the extreme left.

CLOSE UP ON WEATHER CONTROL BOX

Peter turns a lever.

ANGLE ON BALLOON

The balloon and surrounding clouds start to freeze, turning white and
forming ice on them.  Suddenly, snow starts to fall.

ON SLIMER

He sticks his tongue out and catches some snowflakes.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

Blizzard-like snow pelts it.  The chicken begins to stiffen and turn white
with frost.

				WERECHICKEN
			(angry SQUAWKS)

ANGLE ON STREETS

Snow falls on Ray and Winston as they gaze skyward.

				RAY AND WINSTON
		They did it!  All-right!!

They high-five each other.

								WIPE TO:

EXT. FIREHOUSE -- NIGHT

A heavy snow continues to fall as CAMERA MOVES IN

				MAUDE (VO)
			(calls)
		Anyone for dessert?

INT, FIREHOUSE - DINING AREA

Maude (back to normal) emerges from kitchen carrying a large, steaming
bowl.  Seated around the table are Egon (back to normal) Peter, Winston,
Ray and Zeke.  No Slimer.  There are half-empty soup bowls in front of
everyone and the diners all look full to the point of weariness -- except
Slimer.

				EGON
			(raising hand)
		You bet, Maude.

ON PETER

As he looks at bowl of soup Maude sets down.

				PETER
		Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!

ON EGON

spooning soup eagerly into his bowl.

				EGON
		I'm actually starting to like it.

ON MAUDE

				MAUDE
		No more werechicken problems for us,
		eh, Egon?
			(CHUCKLES)

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWL)

WIDER ANGLE

Everyone freezes and looks o.s.

				WINSTON
		Uh-oh.

				RAY
		It came from the lab!

The Ghostbusters burst from their chairs and run o.s.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB

As the Ghostbusters cautiously advance, blasters ready.

INT. LAB -- ON DOOR

It opens and the Ghostbusters peer in.  Suddenly ...

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(another HOWL)

SWISH PAN to ...

A HUGE SHADOW on the lab wall, its head making a "pecking" motion like a
werechicken.  After a beat, PAN DOWN to reveal Slimer with a Walkman on
his head, "pecking" his head to the rhythm of his music.  Slimer HOWLS
again ...

				SLIMER
			(HOWLS)

ON GHOSTBUSTERS

				WINSTON
			(big SIGH)
		It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James
		Brown tape.

ON SLIMER

As he continues to groove to the music.

				SLIMER
			(a la James Brown)
		I feel good!
		I knew that I would
		So good, so good, so good!
			(big James Brown HOWL as
			we --)
			(HOWLS)

ON GHOSTBUSTERS

Peter turns to the others in disgust.

				PETER
			(long-suffering)
		Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken
		outfit?

								FADE OUT

              from the novel by Stephen King

              First Draft
              11/4/97


              "We each owe a death, there are no exceptions..."

              --------------------------------------------------------------

              A SONG BEGINS, distant as a faded memory on an old Victrola:

              Once I built a railroad, made it run... Made it race against
              time...Once I built a railroad, now it's done...Brother, can
              you spare a dime...

              Opening credit sequence

              plays against footage of the Great Depression, images
              haunting and sepia-toned, defining an era. The bread
              lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading
              west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in
              their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their
              bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding
              the rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows on
              the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One as
              "Hooverville" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's
              capitol...

              All these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so
              very long ago...

              EXT. FIELD - DAY(SLOW MOTION)

              ...where cattails sway in the sepia-toned heat. A small scrap
              of fabric is snagged in the nettles, fluttering languidly...

              COLOR BLEEDS SLOWLY IN as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies
              skitter, showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow...

              Suddenly, a MAN WITH A SHOTGUN comes crashing through the
              cattails, wiping through frame and exiting...

              ...then ANOTHER MAN...and ANOTHER...armed with rifles,
              plowing through the brush, exiting frame...

              ...and now comes KLAUS DETTERICK, a farmer one step above
              shirt-tail poor, a double-barrel shotgun in the crook of his
              arm. He pauses, horrified, seeing the scrap of cloth. He
              pulls it loose, turns back, screaming something in anguish...

              ...and still more men come crashing into view, flooding by us
              with dreamlike, slow-motion grace. ONE MAN is leading a team
              of DOGS, trying to untangle the leads. DEPUTY ROB McGEE is
              shouting for everybody to stay together...

              ...and under it all, we hear a sibilant, frightening whisper:

                                  WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
                        You love your sister? You make any
                        noise, know what happens?

              And off that horrible voice, we

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. GEORGIA PINES NURSING HOME - MORNING(PRESENT DAY)

              A CLOCK RADIO spews the morning weather report, abruptly
              pulling us into the present with a prediction of rain. PAUL
              EDGECOMB, late 70's/early 80's, wakes to another day...

              INT. PAUL'S ROOM - MORNING

              Paul stands at his bathroom mirror, meticulously buttoning
              his shirt. He picks up a hairbrush, starts tidying his hair...

              INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING

              THE OLD AND INFIRM haunt these corridors like ghosts. A WOMAN
              inches along on a walker. A MAN shuffles by with a rolling
              I.V. stand. The floor is a limey, institutional green.

              Paul comes into view, spry for his age, murmurs an occasional
              greeting.

              INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING

              DOZENS OF RETIREES are having breakfast, sipping weak coffee
              or tea. Some chat and gossip, other are content to keep their
              own company, some just stare slackly into space.

              Paul enters, sees ELAINE CONNELLY sitting with a few other
              ladies, sipping tea. She's 80, refined and elegant, his best
              friend here. She gives him a good-morning smile. He gives her
              a rakish wink in return, which makes her smiles all the more.

              Paul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two
              pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate. He tosses
              Elaine another look--catch ya later--and exits.

              INT. HALLWAY PAST KITCHEN - MORNING

              Paul slips to the back door unnoticed. Identical red plastic
              rain ponchos line the wall on pegs. He helps himself to one
              and eases outside, making good his escape.

              EXT. NURSING HOME - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

              Nestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling
              over the treetops.

              Paul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed
              poncho. He looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply--
              this is a man who loves his walks.

              He pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to
              nibble as he presses up on the ridge...

              Low angle: nursing home and ridge beyond

              ...and we see Paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up
              toward the treeline. A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame and
              parks, a bumper sticker looming large: "I Have Seen God and
              His Name Is Newt Gingrich".

              BRAD DOLAN gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's,
              arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt. He gazes
              up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly:

                                  BRAD
                        Old fuck.

              He slams the door and heads for the nursing home...

              EXT. WOODS - MORNING

              ...as CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul
              wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking
              for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic poncho.

              It's silent here, like a church. The only sounds we hear are
              the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the
              woodpecker.

              A RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze. He turns, becomes
              transfixed. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        Oh, my...

              Reverse angle

              reveals a magnificent BUCK, not twenty feet away, misty
              breath punching the cold morning air. They watch each other
              for an endless moment, both standing stock still...

              ...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the
              foliage. Paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder.
              He takes another bite of toast, moves on...

              ...and WE PAN WITH HIM to reveal a pair of old wooden storage
              shacks along the path up ahead.

              INT. SHACK - MORNING

              Dark in here, cobwebby and decrepit. We see Paul approaching
              outside the grimy window. He steps up to the glass and shades
              his eyes, peering curiously in as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

              Paul approaches the back door, returning from his walk. He
              reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from
              behind the dumpster to grab his wrist. He whirls, gasping in
              fright--it's Brad Dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform.

                                  BRAD
                        Out for a little stroll, Paulie?

                                  PAUL
                        Let go...

              Paul tries to pull away, but Dolan's got him tight.

                                  BRAD
                        What's with this poncho you got
                        on, huh? This isn't yours.

                                  PAUL
                        I got it off the wall there.
                        There's a whole row of them.

                                  BRAD
                        But not for you, Paulie, that's
                        the thing. Those are for the staff.

                                  PAUL
                        I just borrowed it. Don't see what
                        harm it does.

                                  BRAD
                        It's not about harm, it's about
                        rules. You probably don't think an
                        old fart like you has to mind
                        rules anymore, but that's just not
                        true.

              Brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing
              the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm sorry if I broke the rules.

                                  BRAD
                        You got no business up in those
                        woods anyway, especially in the
                        rain. What if you fall and bust a
                        hip, huh? Who you think's gonna
                        have to hoss your sorry old bacon
                        back down here? Me, that's who.

                                  PAUL
                        You're hurting me!

                                  BRAD
                        What do you do up there, anyway?
                        You're too old to go jerk off, so
                        what do you do?

                                  PAUL
                        Nothing. I just walk, that's all,
                        I like to walk!

              Brad lashes out and grabs Paul's other hand, which he's been
              holding tightly clenched shut.

                                  BRAD
                        Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see.

              Paul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of
              a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear.

                                  ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Paul?

              They turn. Elaine stands just inside the screen door with a
              cup of tea. Brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much
              she's seen. Elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:

                                  ELAINE
                        I saw you coming back, thought
                        you'd like some tea.
                               (beat)
                        Are you coming in?

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting.
                        About the weather. I think we're
                        through now.

              Brad lets Paul loose, leans close:

                                  BRAD
                        Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed
                        your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em
                        you're having senile delusions.
                        Who you think they'll believe?

              Brad walks off. Paul turns, watches him go. The screen door
              opens and Elaine steps out, her face pale. Paul gives her a
              strained, though grateful, smile as we

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. TV ROOM - DAY

              Jerry Springer's on the tube, whipping his studio audience
              into a frenzy. PAN OFF TO REVEAL DOZENS OF OLD FOLKS watching
              on couches and folding chairs. An old black fellow named PETE
              is grousing to a GROUP OF ELDERLY LADIES...

                                  PETE
                        Why we always watch this crap?

                                  ELDERLY LADY #1
                        It's interesting.

                                  PETE
                        Interesting? Bunch'a inbred
                        trailer trash, all they ever talk
                        about is fucking...

              ...and WE CONTINUE PANNING to Paul and Elaine sitting near
              the back, talking quietly as Paul rubs his bruised hand:

                                  ELAINE
                        We should report him.

                                  PAUL
                        That might just provoke him all
                        the more, make things worse for
                        everybody.

                                  ELAINE
                        It's not everybody he has it in
                        for, Paul. It's you.
                               (off his look)
                        What did you do to provoke him in
                        the first place? Nothing. He's
                        just an abusive bully, and should
                        be made to stop.

                                  PAUL
                        Ellie, please...

              Pete

              is at the TV, switching channels while:

                                  ELDERLY LADIES
                        ...no, the Movie Classic channel
                        is further down...past the Home
                        Shopping...keep going...

              He finds the Movie Classic channel, which is playing an old
              black and white musical--"Top Hat," with Fred Astaire and
              Ginger Rogers. A delighted reaction:

                                  ELDERLY LADY #2
                        Oh! This is wonderful...

              Paul

              idly shifts his gaze to the TV...and his expression goes
              slack with recognition and dismay. Elaine sees the look in
              his eyes.

              He glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in
              the end, he can't help himself. The past just caught up with
              him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to
              ride the rails...

              He looks back at the TV. On screen, Fred and Ginger have
              begun their famous "Cheek to Cheek" number, with Astaire
              singing in that sublime, easy-go-lucky way of his:

                                  FRED ASTAIRE
                        Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my
                        heart beat so that I can hardly
                        speak...

              SLOW PUSH IN on Paul, watching. He'd like to take his eyes
              off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than
              Brad Dolan's. Elaine is watching him with puzzled concern:

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul? What is it?

              No response. All he can hear is that music, all he can see
              are those dancers. The figures on TV are gliding with
              ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long
              ago...

              Paul abruptly bursts into tears.

              The room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill. All
              eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious. Paul just
              sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul...my God...

                                  ORDERLY
                               (rushing over)
                        What is it? What's wrong?

                                  PAUL
                        It's okay...I'll be okay...

              Another orderly appears--Brad Dolan. He puts his hand on
              Paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern.

                                  BRAD
                        S'matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo-
                        hoo? Something nasty happen?

              Elaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger.

                                  ELAINE
                        Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly
                        fine without your help, thank you.

              Brad back off with a "hey, suit yourself" gesture. Elaine
              helps Paul to his feet and leads him out.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. SUN ROOM - DAY

              Paul is staring out the windows, pensive and drained. It's
              raining now, pattering the glass and the lawn beyond. Elaine
              waits across from him, wishing he would speak. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        I guess sometimes the past just
                        catches up with you, whether you
                        want it to or not. It's silly.

                                  ELAINE
                        Was it the film?
                               (off his look)
                        It was, wasn't it?

                                  PAUL
                        I haven't spoken of these things
                        in a long time, Ellie. Over sixty
                        years.

              She reaches out, gently takes his hand.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul. I'm your friend.

                                  PAUL
                        Yes. Yes you are.

              Paul wonders if he's even up to talking about it after all
              this time...and decides that perhaps he is:

                                  PAUL
                        I ever tell you I was a prison
                        guard during the depression?

                                  ELAINE
                        You've mentioned it.

                                  PAUL
                        Did I mention I was in charge of
                        death row? That I supervised all
                        the executions?

              This does come as a surprise. She shakes her head.

                                  PAUL
                        They usually call death row the
                        Last Mile, but we called ours the
                        Green Mile, because the floor was
                        the color of faded limes. We had
                        the electric chair then. Old
                        Sparky, we called it.

                        I've lived a lot of years, Ellie,
                        but 1935 takes the prize. That was
                        the year I had the worst urinary
                        infection of my life. That was
                        also the year of John Coffey, and
                        the two dead girls...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              In blackness, a title card appears:

                                  "The Two Dead Girls"

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (1935)

              HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS work the fields, pickaxes rising and
              falling in waves, a prison song being sung in cadence with
              the work. GUARDS patrol on horseback, rifles aimed at the sky.

              A late 20's Ford PRISON TRUCK comes chugging into view along
              the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat. It
              seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension.

              EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

              A Depression-era prison in the south. The prison truck sways
              down the rutted dirt road toward the main gate...

              INT. E BLOCK TOILET - DAY

              ...while Paul Edgecomb, early 40's, stands in a cramped
              toilet in his guard's uniform, trying to piss. His face is
              pained, his forehead beaded with sweat.

              INT. E BLOCK (THE GREEN MILE) - DAY

              BRUTUS HOWELL(nicknamed "Brutal" for his intimidating size,
              but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the
              entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing
              slot. He sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate.

              He turns and nods to fellow guard DEAN STANTON sitting at the
              duty desk, then cross the Green Mile--a wide corridor of
              faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom,
              with four large cells to a side.

              Brutal steps to the bathroom, listen a moment, knocks softly.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul? Prisoner.

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                        Christ. Gimme a minute.

              Brutal waits patiently, a bit embarrassed. He finally hears
              a THIN TRICKLE, accompanied by a stifled groan of pain.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You all right in there?

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                        For a man pissing razor blades.

              The door opens, revealing Paul's pale and sweaty face.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You should'a took the day off,
                        gone to see the doctor.

                                  PAUL
                        With a new arrival? You know
                        better. Besides, it's not as bad
                        as it was. I think it's clearing
                        up.

              They hear the truck HONKING as it rumbles up outside. Paul
              gives them a nod to resume their positions. Paul walks down
              the Mile, passing the cells where two inmates reside--the
              first is ARLEN BITTERBUCK, a Washita Cherokee; the second is
              EDUARD DELACROIX("DEL"), a skinny Cajun.

                                  DEL
                        New boy coming in, boss?

                                  PAUL
                        Never you mind, Del, you just keep
                        your nose quietly on your business.

              Paul arrives at the end of the Mile, takes up a position at
              an empty cell. (Down at this end, past the cells, is E
              Block's version of the "hole" -- a padded room where violent
              inmates are sent to cool off. It isn't used very often...in
              fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.)

              Brutal

              peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Damn, they're riding on the axle.
                        What'd they do, bust the springs?

              GUARDS PERCY WETMORE AND HARRY TERWILLIGER OF E BLOCK emerge
              from the back of the truck and step down, turn back...

              Tighter angle on back of truck

              We get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of
              GIGANTIC BLACK FEET step down into the yard...and the rear of
              the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs.

              Brutal

              sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul? You might wanna reconsider
                        getting in the cell with this guy?

                                  PAUL
                        Why's that?

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's enormous.

                                  PAUL
                        Can't be bigger than you.

              Brutal tosses him a look--just wait. He swings the door open
              in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at:

              John coffey

              is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his
              massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old
              scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending
              at mid-calf. He looks dull and confused, as if wondering
              where he is and how he got there. Percy and Harry lead him
              toward E Block in shackles. Percy's got his hickory baton out
              of it custom-made holster, hollering:

                                  PERCY
                        Dead man walking! Dead man walking
                        here!

              Inside the cellblock

              Paul can't see them approach from where he stands, but he can
              certainly hear Percy:

                                  PAUL
                        Jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell's
                        he yelling about?

              Up by the door, Brutal just rolls his eyes. Percy is the
              first one through the door, still hollering...

                                  PERCY
                        Dead man walking!

              ...then Coffey enters, ducking low to get through, his shadow
              blotting out Brutal and Dean as his massive frame fills the
              door. Everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of
              "hold shit" written on everybody's faces. Percy keeps yanking
              on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:

                                  PERCY
                        Dead man walking! Dead man--

                                  PAUL
                        Percy, that's enough.

              Percy falls reproachfully silent. Paul doesn't dignify it,
              just motions for them to come on. The procession comes down
              the Mile, with Brutal and Dean bringing up rear.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You sure you wanna be in there
                        with him?

                                  PAUL
                               (looks to Coffey)
                        Am I gonna have trouble with you,
                        big boy?

              Coffey shakes his head slowly. Paul takes the clipboard
              transfer papers from Harry, turns and enters the cell.

              Coffey just stands outside the cell and waits, as if he
              doesn't understand the concept. Paul motions him to come on
              in. Coffey starts to comply, but Percy raps him smartly with
              the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster.

              Coffey flinches, enters the cell. Paul stares angrily at
              Percy, who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm
              of his hand like a man with a toy he's itching to use.

                                  PAUL
                        Percy. They're moving house over
                        in the infirmary. Why don't you go
                        see if they could use some help?

                                  PERCY
                        They got all the men they need.

                                  PAUL
                        Why don't you just go make sure?
                               (off his look)
                        I don't care where you go, Percy,
                        as long as it's not here at this
                        very moment.

              Percy flushes red, the baton hovering near his palm. He looks
              like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and
              stalks angrily up the Mile instead...

              ...and sees Del at his bars, smiling. Infuriated, Percy
              swings his baton and smashes Del's fingers with a LOUD CRACK.
              Del jerks back, howling in pain:

                                  DEL
                        OWW, GOD, HE BUS' MY FINGERS!

                                  PERCY
                        Wiped that grin off your shitpoke
                        face, didn't I

                                  PAUL
                        Goddamn it, Percy! Get the hell
                        off my block!

              Percy throws Paul a look of disdain--your block, huh? He
              swaggers out. Del's on his knees, weeping from the pain:

                                  DEL
                        Oww, damn, boss, he done bus' my
                        fingers for true...

                                  PAUL
                        We'll get it looked at, Del, now
                        keep yourself quiet like I said!

              Del falls silent, moaning over his hand. Paul turns to
              Coffey, who looks unsettled by all the commotion.

                                  PAUL
                        If I let Harry take those chains
                        off you, you gonna be nice?

              Coffey nods. Harry enters to remove Coffey's shackles.

                                  PAUL
                        Your name is John Coffey.

                                  COFFEY
                               (deep and quiet)
                        Yes, sir, boss, like the drink,
                        only not spelt the same.

                                  PAUL
                        So you can spell, can you?

              Coffey shakes his head. Harry steps out.

                                  PAUL
                        My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I'm
                        not here, you can ask for Mr.
                        Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr.
                        Stanton...those gentlemen there.
                               (beat)
                        This isn't like the rest of the
                        prison. It's a quiet place, we
                        like to keep it that way.

              Coffey considers this carefully, puzzled.

                                  COFFEY
                        It weren't me making all the
                        noise, boss.

                                  PAUL
                               (eyes narrowing)
                        You having a joke on me, John
                        Coffey?

                                  COFFEY
                        No, sir.

              Paul sees he isn't joking, continues:

                                  PAUL
                        Your time here can be easy or
                        hard, depends on you. If you
                        behave, you get to walk in the
                        exercise yard every day.

                        We might even play some music on
                        the radio from time to time.
                        Questions?

              Coffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask:

                                  COFFEY
                        Do you leave a light on after
                        bedtime?

              Paul blinks. It's the last thing he expected. Coffey smiles
              uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.

                                  COFFEY
                        Because I get a little scared in
                        the dark sometimes. If it's a
                        strange place.

              Paul looks to his men. The guards are trading glances.

                                  PAUL
                        It's pretty bright in here all
                        night long. We keep half the
                        lights burning in the corridor.

                                  COFFEY
                        Cor'der.

              Coffey looks confused. Paul points to the lights lining the
              ceiling of the Green Mile in wire mesh cages.

                                  PAUL
                        Right out there.

              Coffey nods, relieved. Then he surprises everybody by
              offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Paul
              hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by
              accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gently,
              lets go.

              Paul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, locks
              it. Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then
              sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees.
              He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to
                        take it back, but it was too late.

              Paul turns, leads his men up the Mile...

              ...and they enter a few moments later. Paul is furious, but
              keeping a lid on his temper:

                                  PAUL
                        Dean, run Delacroix up to the
                        infirmary and see if his fingers
                        are broken.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Course they're broken, I heard the
                        damn bones crack. Goddamn Percy.

                                  HARRY
                        You hear what he was yelling when
                        we brought the big dummy in?

                                  PAUL
                        How could I miss it, Harry? The
                        whole prison heard.

              This makes Brutal snort, breaking the tension--the others
              can't help smiling.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You'll probably have to answer for
                        sending him off the Mile. He's
                        gonna cause you trouble over this,
                        you mark me.

                                  PAUL
                        I'll chew that food when I have
                        to. Right now I wanna hear about
                        the new inmate...aside from how
                        big he is, okay?

                                  BRUTAL
                               (smiles)
                        Monstrous big. Damn.

                                  PAUL
                        Seems meek enough. Looks like they
                        sent us an imbecile to execute.

                                  HARRY
                        Imbecile or not, he deserves to
                        fry for what he done. Here...

              Harry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber
              bands on the desk before Paul--Coffey's file.

                                  HARRY
                        ...make your blood curdle.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. E BLOCK PRISON YARD - DAY

              A small are reserved for inmates of the Mile, fenced-off from
              the main prison yard. Arlen Bitterbuck walks the perimeter
              under the watchful eyes of guard BILL DODGE.

              We find Paul sitting by himself on the bleachers with
              Coffey's file on his knees, thoughtfully unwrapping his brown-
              bagged sandwich. PUSH SLOWLY IN as he begins to read...

              EXT. DETTERICK FARM - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

              ...and we see Klaus Detterick walk from his house to the barn
              with a milking pail, a solitary figure against a brightening
              horizon. He disappears into the barn...

              ...and we hold for a long moment, the house silent
              b.g.,chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard...

              ...until a WOMAN'S SCREAM shatters the silence. Klaus
              reappears, dropping the pail, running toward the house...

              PAUL ON BLEACHERS

              ...as Paul turns the page, keeps reading...

              INT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

              ...and Klaus bursts in to find his wife MARJORIE absolutely
              frantic with terror:

                                  KLAUS
                        WHAT? GOD SAKES, WHAT?

                                  MARJORIE
                        THE GIRLS! THE GIRLS ARE GONE!

              She drags him through the house to a screened-off porch area
              where their 12 year old son HOWIE is pointing and shouting--

                                  HOWIE
                        Papa! Papa, look! The blood!

              --and Klaus freezes there, stunned to see blood spattered on
              the floor and the screen door hanging off its hinges...

                                  KLAUS
                        Oh my God.

              PAUL ON BLEACHERS

              ...as Paul absently takes another bite of his sandwich, not
              really tasting it, keeps reading...

              INT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

              ...plunging us back into the screaming chaos: Klaus grabbing
              up shotgun shells, Howie loading the .22 rifle he got for
              Christmas, Marjorie sobbing incoherently...

                                  KLAUS
                        GODDAMN IT, WOMAN, GET ON THE
                        PHONE NOW! YOU TELL 'EM WE HEADED
                        WEST! MIND WHAT I'M SAYING! WEST,
                        Y'HEAR?

              ...and she goes stumbling through the house, grabbing for the
              phone as her men disappear toward the porch b.g.:

                                  MARJORIE
                        Central! Central, are you on the
                        line? Oh, God, please, somebody
                        took my little girls...

              OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

              Klaus and his son race from the house, following spatters of
              blood across the yard...

              PAUL ON THE BLEACHERS

              ...as Paul lets out a long breath, turns the page...

              EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

              ---and we see CARS AND TRUCKS pulling up, MEN jumping out
              with rifles, pouring down the incline toward the field where
              Klaus is hollering and waving his arms. Deputy McGee comes
              sliding down from the road, taking charge at the top of his
              lungs--

                                  McGEE
                        I WANT ALL THE WEAPONS UNLOADED,
                        Y'HEAR? TAKE OUT YOUR SHELLS, I
                        WON'T HAVE A MAN SHOT BY ACCIDENT
                        TODAY! BOBO, WHERE THEM DOGS?

              --and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck,
              howling down the incline to lead the chase...

              VARIOUS ANGLES

              ...which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes...to the
              spot where Klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow
              fabric, turns and screams...

                                  KLAUS
                        Oh, Lord, this belongs to my
                        Katie...

              ...and they keep going, stopping abruptly as they find: A
              blood-drenched area of tramped grass. A little girl's bloody
              nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree. Some of these
              strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the
              sight of it. Their blood freezes in their veins as an INHUMAN
              HOWLING commences up ahead. It's like nothing they've ever
              heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike.

              PAUL ON BLEACHERS

              ...as Paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head...

                                  PAUL
                        Jesus.

              EXT. FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

              The men reload their weapons. Everybody's terrified. McGee
              starts off, the other following his lead toward--

              THE RIVER

              --where they emerge from the treeline, drawing ever closer to
              the source of that INHUMAN HOWLING...

              ...and they stop, gazing in horror:

              John Coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his
              huge feet splayed out before him. He's making that inhuman
              howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing
              occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air.

              Curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of
              Detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now
              matted to their heads with blood.

              A tableau. The men staring. John Coffey howling. A train
              puffing smoke across the landscape.

              Klaus Detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank
              in a headlong rush. The others try to grab him, but he shrugs
              them off and throws himself on Coffey with a scream of
              inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. Coffey
              barely seems to notice.

              The others catch up with Klaus, drag him off. He falls to his
              knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. Howie runs to
              him, throws himself into his father's arm. They hug each
              other tightly, overwhelmed with grief.

              A semblance of quiet descends, except for Coffey's
              heartbroken wailing. A ring of rifle toting men forms around
              him, though he hardly seems aware of it. McGee steps forward,
              uncertain:

                                  McGEE
                        Mister.

              Coffey goes quiet at once, eyes still streaming tears.

                                  McGEE
                        Mister? Can you hear me?
                               (Coffey nods)
                        You have a name?

                                  COFFEY
                        John Coffey. Like the drink, only
                        not spelt the same.

              McGee hunkers carefully down, watching for any sudden moves.

                                  McGEE
                        What happened here, John Coffey?
                        You want to tell me that?

                                  COFFEY
                        I couldn't help it. I tried to
                        take it back, but it was too late.

                                  McGEE
                               (pause)
                        Boy, you are under arrest for
                        murder.

              McGee spits in Coffey's face...

              PAUL ON BLEACHERS

              ...as Paul looks up with a slight start, jarred from his
              reading to find WARDEN HAL MOORES standing before him.

                                  HAL
                        I interrupt?

                                  PAUL
                        I'm just about done.

              Paul stows the file as Hal settles onto the bleachers.

                                  PAUL
                        How's that pretty gal of yours?

                                  HAL
                        Melinda's not so well, Paul. Not
                        so well at all. Got laid up with
                        another headache yesterday. Worst
                        one yet. She's also developed this
                        weakness in her right hand.

                                  PAUL
                        Doctor still think it's migraines?

              Hal gives a slight shake of his head.

                                  HAL
                        I'll be taking her up to Indianola
                        next day or so for some tests. Had
                        X-rays and the like. She is scared
                        to death. Truth to tell, so am I.

                                  PAUL
                        If it's something they can see
                        with an X-ray, maybe it's
                        something they can fix.

                                  HAL
                        Maybe.

              He pulls a letter, hands it to Paul.

                                  HAL
                        This just came in. D.O.E. on
                        Bitterbuck.

              Paul glances toward Bitterbuck, scans the letter, nods.

                                  PAUL
                        You didn't come all the way down
                        here just to hand me a D.O.E.

                                  HAL
                        No. I had an angry call from the
                        state capital about twenty minutes
                        ago. Is it true you ordered Percy
                        Wetmore off the block.

                                  PAUL
                        It is.

                                  HAL
                        I'm sure you had reason, but like
                        it or not, the wife of the
                        governor of this state has only
                        one nephew, and his name happens
                        to be Percy Wetmore. I need to
                        tell you how this lays out?

                                  PAUL
                        Little Percy called his aunt and
                        squealed like a schoolroom sissy.
                               (Hal nods)
                        He also mention he assaulted a
                        prisoner this morning out of sheer
                        petulance? Broke three fingers on
                        Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

                                  HAL
                        I didn't hear that part. I'm sure
                        she didn't either.

                                  PAUL
                        The man is mean, careless, and
                        stupid. Bad combination in a place
                        like this. Sooner or later, he's
                        gonna get somebody hurt. Or worse.

                                  HAL
                        You and Brutus Howell will make
                        sure that doesn't happen.

                                  PAUL
                        Easy enough to say. We can't watch
                        him every minute, Hal.

                                  HAL
                        Stick with it. May not be much
                        longer. I have it on good
                        authority that Percy has an
                        application in at Briar Ridge.

                                  PAUL
                        The mental hospital?

                                  HAL
                               (nods)
                        Administration job. Better pay.

                                  PAUL
                        Then why's he still here? He could
                        get that application pushed
                        through...hell, with his
                        connections, he could have any
                        state job he wants.

              Hal has no answer. Paul look off toward Bitterbuck.

                                  PAUL
                        Tell you what I think. I think he
                        just wants to see one cook up
                        close.

              Hal follows Paul's gaze, takes his meaning.

                                  HAL
                        Well, he'll get his chance then,
                        won't he? Maybe then he'll be
                        satisfied and move on. In the
                        meantime, you'll keep the peace.

                                  PAUL
                        Of course.

                                  HAL
                        Thank you, Paul.

              Hal rises, slapping yard dust off his trousers.

                                  PAUL
                        You give Melinda my love, okay? I
                        bet that X-ray turns out to be
                        nothing at all.

              Hal walks off looking like he's got the weight of the world
              on his shoulders. Paul looks at the letter again...

              TIGHT ON LETTER

              ...which is head: Date Of Execution."

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours of the morning,
              drinking buttermilk and listening to SOFT MUSIC on the radio.
              JANICE EDGECOMB appears, shuffling sleepily downstairs.

                                  JAN
                        Paul?

                                  PAUL
                        Hey, you. Music too loud?

                                  JAN
                        No. There's just this big empty
                        spot in the bed where my husband
                        usually sleeps.

                                  PAUL
                        He said to tell you he's having a
                        little trouble with that tonight.

              She comes into the kitchen, strokes his hair. There's an easy
              familiarity and a deep love between these two.

                                  JAN
                        Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is
                        that what's got you up?

                                  PAUL
                        Yeah, that. Things.

                                  JAN
                        Things.

              She sits on his lap and gives him a crooked smile--you're not
              getting off that easily.

                                  PAUL
                        Got a new inmate today. Big,
                        simple-minded fella.

                                  JAN
                        Do I want to hear what he did?

                                  PAUL
                        No. One sleepless member of this
                        family's enough.
                               (softly)
                        The things that happen in this
                        world. It's a wonder God allows it.

              She gives him a tiny kiss above his left eyebrow, in that
              special spot that makes him prickle.

                                  JAN
                        Why don't you come to bed? I've
                        got something to help you sleep,
                        and you can have all you want.

                                  PAUL
                        Don't I wish. I've still got
                        something wrong with my
                        waterworks, I don't want to pass
                        it on.

                                  JAN
                        You see Doc Sadler yet?

                                  PAUL
                        No, because he'll want me to take
                        sulfa tablets and I'll spend the
                        rest of the week puking in every
                        corner of my office. It'll run its
                        course all by itself, thank you
                        very much for your concern.

              She kisses that spot above his eyebrow again. He smiles.

                                  JAN
                        Poor old guy...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              IN TIGHT ANGLES: Copper plugs are cleaned, switches are
              oiled, circuits are tested...

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

              ...as maintenance is performed on Old Sparky by JACK VAN HAY
              and a small crew. Paul is carefully sanding a connector plug.
              Dean is waxing Old Sparky's wooden arms to a gleam.

              Paul and Dean pause, thinking they hear a LAUGH drifting in
              from E Block...and then Brutal calls softly to them:

                                  BRUTAL (O.S.)
                        Paul? Dean?

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Paul and Dean enter to find Brutal trying not to wake the
              cons in their cells by laughing too loudly. They follows his
              gaze down the Mile, see nothing, turn to him like he's crazy.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I guess the legislature loosened
                        those purse-strings enough to hire
                        on a new guard.
                               (off their looks)
                        Look again. He's right there.

              Paul and Dean look again and this time they see it:

              A tiny brown mouse is coming up the Mile. It trots a short
              distance, peers right and left as if checking the snoring
              inmates in their cells, then makes another forward spurt.

                                  PAUL
                        He's doing a cell check.

              This gets them all trying not to laugh. The mouse draws ever
              closer. Dean starts to look worried.

                                  DEAN
                        It ain't normal for a mouse to
                        come up on people that way. Maybe
                        it's rabid.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Oh, my Christ. The big mouse
                        expert. The Mouse Man. You see it
                        foaming at the mouth, Mouse Man?

                                  DEAN
                               (dubious)
                        I don't see its mouth at all.

              That does it--Paul and Brutal burst out laughing. The mouse
              stops before them and peers up, curling its tail primly
              around its paws as if to wait. The guards fall silent,
              fascinated. Bitterbuck stirs in his cell, sits up to watch.

              Brutal tears off a piece of his half-eaten corned beef
              sandwich, holds it delicately out with two fingers. The mouse
              rises up, appraising the morsel with shiny black eyes.

                                  DEAN
                        Aw, Brutal, no! We'll be hip-deep
                        in mice around here...

                                  BRUTAL
                               (to Paul)
                        I just wanna see what he'll do. In
                        the interests of science, like.

              Paul shrugs. Brutal drops the scrap. The mouse grabs it and
              eats, sitting up like a dog doing a trick.

              The mouse turns and scurries back down the Mile, vanishing
              under the restraint room door at the far end. Dean throws
              Paul an "I told you so" look.

                                  DEAN
                        He's in the damn restraint room.
                        You know he's gonna be chewing the
                        padding out of walls and making
                        himself a nice little nest.

              Brutal give Paul a sheepish look--well? Paul sighs.

                                  PAUL
                        All right. Let's get the damn
                        mouse.

              They stride grimly down the Mile to the restraint room door,
              men on a mission. Coffey's awake now, peering from his cot.

                                  COFFEY
                        Saw me a mouse go by.

                                  PAUL
                        It was a dream. Go back to sleep.

                                  COFFEY
                        Weren't no dream. It was a mouse
                        all right.

                                  PAUL
                        Can't put anything over on you.

              Paul unlocks the door, revealing a padded room filled with
              storage: cleaning supplies, buckets of paint, mops and
              ladders, you name it. Brutal shrugs off his jacket. Paul
              grabs a mop from a steel bucket, hands it to Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Dean, watch the door. He tries to
                        get past you, whack him.

                                  DEAN
                        Brutal or the mouse?

                                  BRUTAL
                        Har har, Mouse Man.

              Brutal and Paul start doing the heavy lifting, muscling an
              unused filing cabinet out the door...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and they finally relay the last few heavy buckets of paint
              onto the Mile. Paul and Brutal catch their breath, scanning
              the empty restraint room. Their eyes go glaringly to Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        You let him get past you.

                                  DEAN
                        No I didn't, I was here all the
                        time!

                                  BRUTAL
                        Then where the hell is he?

              They move slowly into the room, peering into every nook and
              cranny, utterly mystified. Brutal shakes his head.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Three grown men. Outsmarted by a
                        mouse.

                                  DEAN
                        Well, bright side is, all this
                        commotion probably scared him off
                        for good.

                                  PAUL
                        Yeah, that's right. That's the
                        last we'll see of him...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                "The Mouse on the Mile"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              A low, static shot. Green floor stretching before us. Harry
              and Bill Dodge are at the desk b.g., doing paperwork and
              filing chores. Percy is idling nearby, whistling softly and
              combing his hair...

              ...and into this quiet shot, deep in foreground, creeps the
              mouse. He starts walking the Mile as before...

              ...right toward Percy.

              COFFEY

              stares through his bars as the mouse goes by...

              PERCY

              keeps combing his hair, unaware...

              DEL

              sits quietly picking his nose in his cell. The mouse appears
              outside the bars, cruising inexorably up the Mile. Del turns
              slowly, watches the mouse go by...

              PERCY

              still grooming himself, still unaware...

              THE MOUSE

              keeps coming closer. ANGLE UP to Bitterbuck peering through
              his bars, watching him go by...

              PERCY

              keeps working that comb--and freezes at the sound of a TINY
              SQUEAK. His head swivels slowly...

              ...and there's the mouse. Staring at him.

              That moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time
              itself. If mice have a natural enemy, Percy is it.

                                  PAUL
                        You little son of a bitch.

              Harry and Bill glance up from their work.

                                  HARRY
                        Well, I'll be damned. There he is,
                        big as Billy-be-frigged. I thought
                        Brutal was pulling my leg.

                                  BILL
                        That's a goddamn mouse.

                                  HARRY
                        Yeah. Brute said he was in here
                        last night begging for food, came
                        right up to the desk.

                                  BILL
                        My ass. Give him some room, Percy,
                        see what he does.

              Percy takes a few careful steps back, eyes never leaving the
              mouse. (Percy's hand starts easing toward the handle of his
              baton.) The mouse comes up to the desk as before.

                                  HARRY
                        Brave little bastard, gotta give
                        him that.

              Harry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it. The
              mouse picks it up, starts to eat. (Percy's hand inches ever
              closer to his baton).

                                  BILL
                        Here, lemme try.

              Bill drops a piece of cracker. The mouse ignores it
              completely, keeping its beady little eyes on Harry. (Percy's
              hand starts easing his baton from its holster.)

                                  BILL
                        Maybe he's full.

                                  HARRY
                               (grins)
                        Maybe he knows you're just a
                        floater. Gotta be an E Block
                        regular to feed the E Block mouse,
                        don'cha know...

              Harry drops another piece--and sure enough, the mouse starts
              to eat. Harry's smile fades. He and Bill trade a look.

                                  HARRY
                        I was just kidding ab--

              Percy lets rip a BELLOWING WAR CRY ("Yaaaahhh!") and launches
              his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone.

              The mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over
              his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the
              floor. Apparently remembering a pressing engagement
              elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the
              restraint room.

              Percy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying
              to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping
              with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by
              inches...

              ...and thus is the Green Mile traversed, with Percy stomping
              and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts
              yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like Jim
              Thorpe heading for the endzone...

              The mouse wins, zipping to safety under the restraint room
              door. Percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration:

                                  PERCY
                        FUCK!

              He fumbles with his keys, unlocks the door, yelling all the
              while:

                                  PERCY
                        I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DISEASED HEAD
                        OFF, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT!

              OUTSIDE E BLOCK

              Paul and Brutal are arriving for work--they pause, hearing
              PERCY'S YELLS drifting from the windows. The regular CONS in
              the yard are drifting curiously to the fence, wondering if a
              riot's brewing. Paul and Brutal take off running--

              INSIDE E BLOCK

              --and rush in to find:

                                  HARRY
                        Percy met your mouse.

              Harry points. Percy's down at the far end, rummaging wildly
              in the restraint room, tossing shit out onto the Mile.

                                  PERCY
                        It's in here somewhere! I'm gonna
                        squish the little son of a bitch!

              He starts muscling the filing cabinet out the door, kicking
              buckets out of his way. Brutal calls out to him:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Percy, we already tried that--

                                  PERCY
                        What? Whad'ja say?

                                  BRUTAL
                        I said--

              Paul stops Brutal with a look--don't you dare stop him.

                                  BRUTAL
                        --uh, knock yourself out. Hope you
                        nail the bastard.

              Paul crosses his arms and smiles, leans back against the desk
              to wait...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and Percy hauls the last of the stuff out, exhausted. He
              steps back in and looks around, unable to believe there's no
              mouse cowering in the corner. Paul and the men approach,
              keeping straight faces, navigating the crap in the corridor.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Gosh. Ain't in there, huh? Don't
                        that beat the mousie band?

              Percy keeps scanning the restraint room. The others all look
              to Paul, waiting for him to speak--you're the boss.

                                  PAUL
                        Percy. You want to think about
                        what you were doing just now.

                                  PERCY
                               (turns, glaring)
                        I know what I was doing. Trying to
                        get the mouse. You blind?

                                  HARRY
                        You also scared the living crap
                        out of me and Bill. And them.

              He cocks a thumb at the inmates in their cells.

                                  PERCY
                        So what? They aren't in cradle-
                        school, case you didn't notice...

                               (directed at Paul)
                        ...although you treat them that
                        way half the time.

                                  BRUTAL
                        We don't scare 'em any more than
                        we have to, Percy. They're under
                        enough strain as it is.

                                  PAUL
                        Men under strain can snap. Hurt
                        themselves. Hurt others. That's
                        why our job is talking, not
                        yelling. You'll do better to think
                        of this place like an intensive
                        care ward in a hospital--

                                  PERCY
                        I think of it as a bucket of piss
                        to drown rats in. That's all.
                               (scans their faces)
                        Anybody doesn't like it can kiss
                        my ass. How's that sit?

              Brutal steps forward, wanting to slug the little bastard.
              Percy shies back, but keeps his bravado up:

                                  PERCY
                        Try it. You'll be on the bread
                        lines before the week is out.

                                  PAUL
                        We all know who your connections
                        are, Percy...
                               (steps close)
                        ...but you ever threaten a man on
                        this block again, we're all gonna
                        have a go. Job be damned.

                                  PERCY
                        Big talk. You done?

                                  PAUL
                        Get all this shit back in the
                        restraint room. You're cluttering
                        up my Mile.

              They turn and walk away, leaving Percy as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              A SLOW TRACKING SHOT OF THE GREEN FLOOR takes us past a tiny
              scrap of break...and then another...and then past a mousetrap
              primed with a scrap of bacon...

              ...and we keep following a long trail of bread scraps and
              mousetraps until we come to Percy, alone on the Mile,
              carefully laying the last mousetrap down...

              ...and he scoots back against the desk to wait, crouched and
              holding his breath, eyes riveted to the restraint room door
              for any sign of his furry nemesis...

              ...and CAMERA BOOMS SLOWLY DOWN off his face, dipping down to
              floor level...

              ...where the mouse is revealed under the desk, peering in the
              same direction as Percy, wondering what the hell's so
              interesting down there. It hops further out to see...

              ANGLE OF PERCY FROM FLOOR LEVEL

              ...and the mouse enters frame, hopping out a few more steps,
              mouse and man staring in the same direction.

              A long beat. Percy turns, looks down at the mouse. The mouse
              turns, looks up at Percy...

              ...and all hell breaks loose again. They race the Mile as
              before, Percy hollering and stomping all the way, mousetraps
              snapping and flying up into frame as they go charging wildly
              past the cells.

              The mouse wins again. Percy pauses, furious...and sees Coffey
              staring at him from his cell.

                                  COFFEY
                        Saw me a mouse go by.

              Percy loses it, kicking and punching the restraint room door
              in a screaming rage as we

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Paul appears at Bitterbuck's bars with a group of guards.

                                  PAUL
                        Arlen? Your daughter and her
                        family are here.

              Bitterbuck steps from his cell. Bill Dodge escorts him off
              the block. The moment they're gone:

                                  PAUL
                        Let's move. I want at least two
                        rehearsals before he gets back.

              INT. VISITOR'S ROOM - DAY

              Bitterbuck is led in. His DAUGHTER rises...an awkward
              hesitation...and she touches his face, kisses him. He takes
              her hands, kisses them, tries not to cry. The rest of the
              family is there: SON-IN-LAW, GRANDCHILDREN, COUSINS. They
              form around him, murmuring hellos, shaking hands...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              ...while TOOT-TOOT takes Bitterbuck's place in the cell. He's
              a wiry and toothless old trusty, crazy as a tick. He sits:

                                  TOOT
                        Sittin' down, sittin' down,
                        rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

              He glances to Paul--okay, hit it.

                                  PAUL
                        Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

              Toot springs to his feet and steps from the cell.

                                  TOOT
                        I'm steppin' forward, I'm steppin'
                        forward, I'm steppin' forward...

              Toot turns, shows the top of his head to Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Is his head properly shaved?

                                  DEAN
                        No, it's dandruffy and it smells.

                                  PAUL
                        I'll take that for a yes. All
                        right, Arlen, let's go.

              Toot starts up the corridor, ringed by guards.

                                  TOOT
                        I'm walkin' the Mile, I'm walkin'
                        the Mile, I'm walkin' the Mile...

              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE

              Toot throws himself to his knees as soon as they enter:

                                  TOOT
                        I'm prayin', I'm prayin', I'm
                        prayin'. The Lord is my shepherd,
                        so on an' so forth...

                                  PAUL
                        Toot, you have to wait till I tell
                        you to pray.
                               (Toot waits)
                        Okay, pray.

                                  TOOT
                        Still prayin', still prayin'...

                                  HARRY
                        Paul, we're not gonna have some
                        Cherokee medicine man in here
                        whoopin' and hollerin' and shaking
                        his dick, are we?

                                  PAUL
                        Well, actually--

                                  TOOT
                        Still prayin', prayin', gettin'
                        right with Jesus...

                                  HARRY
                        Do it quietly, you old gink!

              Harry slaps Toot upside the head to shut him up.

                                  PAUL
                        As I was saying, I don't believe
                        they actually shake their dicks,
                        Harry. Be that as it may, Mr.
                        Bitterbuck is a Christian, so we
                        got Reverend Schuster coming in.

                                  DEAN
                        Oh, he's good. Fast, too. Doesn't
                        get 'em worked up.

                                  PAUL
                        On your feet, Toot. You've prayed
                        enough for one day.

                                  TOOT
                        Gettin' to my feet, walkin' again,
                        walkin' on the Green Mile...

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              They enter. Brutal is waiting for them, gun drawn. Percy
              peers out from behind the partition wall from the switch room.

                                  PERCY
                        What do I do?

                                  PAUL
                        Watch and learn.

              Paul motions Percy behind the wall. Percy sighs, takes his
              spot next to Jack Van Hay, peers through the wire mesh as
              Toot plops into Old Sparky, wriggling his skinny ass to get
              comfy.

                                  TOOT
                        Sittin' down, sittin' down, takin'
                        a seat in Old Sparky's lap...

              Paul and Dean kneel to apply the ankle clamps. Brutal steps
              in from the side, pressing down on the condemned man's left
              arm to keep him in place until the ankle clamps are secure.
              Harry moves in from the other side, securing the right arm
              clamp.

                                  TOOT
                        Gettin' clamped, gettin' clamped,
                        gettin'--ow, shit, watch the skin!

              Paul signals "ankles secure." Brutal holsters his pistol,
              applies the final clamp to the left arm.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Roll on one.

              BEHIND THE PARTITION

              Van Hay mimes turning the generator knob up, whispering:

                                  VAN HAY
                        "Roll on one" means I turn the
                        generator up full. You'll see the
                        lights go brighter in half the
                        prison...

              RESUME MAIN CHAMBER

              as Brutal steps before the "condemned" and pronounces:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been
                        condemned to die by a jury of your
                        peers, sentence imposed by a judge
                        in good standing in this state.

                        Do you have anything to say before
                        the sentence is carried out?

                                  TOOT
                               (gleefully)
                        Yeah! I want a fried chicken
                        dinner with gravy on the taters,
                        I want to shit in your hat, and I
                        got to have Mae West sit on my
                        face, because I am one horny
                        motherfucker!

              Brutal tries to hold on, but it's impossible--he cracks up.
              Everybody falls apart, howling helplessly with laughter. Even
              Jack Van Hay is guffawing behind his partition.

              Only Paul is reining it in--he's a little too pissed to go
              with it. He waits until the laughing fit starts to pass, then:

                                  PAUL
                        Shut up, Brutal. That goes for
                        everybody. I want quiet in here.
                               (turns)
                        Toot, another remark like that,
                        I'll have Van Hay roll on two for
                        real.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (beat, gently)
                        It was pretty funny.

                                  PAUL
                        That's why I don't like it.
                        Tomorrow night we're doing this
                        for real. I don't want somebody
                        remembering a stupid joke like
                        that and getting going again.
                               (off their looks)
                        Ever try not laughing in church
                        once something funny gets stuck in
                        your head. Same goddamn thing.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Sorry, Paul. You're right. Let's
                        keep going. Harry...

              Harry takes a black mask and snugs it down over Toot's head,
              leaving only the crown of his head exposed. Brutal takes a
              large sponge, dips it in a steel bucket, mimes soaking it...

              BEHIND THE PARTITION

                                  PERCY
                        What's with the sponge?

                                  VAN HAY
                        You soak it in brine, get it good
                        and wet. Conducts the electricity
                        directly to the brain, fast like
                        a bullet. You don't ever want to
                        throw the switch on a man without
                        that.

              RESUME MAIN CHAMBER

              as the sponge is placed atop Toot's head. Harry now lowers
              the steel cap and Brutal secures the straps.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity
                        shall now be passed through your
                        body until you are dead, in
                        accordance with the state law. God
                        have mercy on your soul.
                               (to Van Hay)
                        Roll on two.

              BEHIND THE PARTITION

              Van Hay mimes flipping the switch, looks to Percy:

                                  VAN HAY
                        And that's that.

              RESUME MAIN CHAMBER

              Toot can't resist--he starts bucking and flailing:

                                  TOOT
                        Now I'm fryin'! Fryin'! Geeaaah!
                        Fryin' like a done tom turkey!

              Paul rolls his eyes at Brutal. Brutal shifts his gaze past
              him and nods--look behind you.

                                  BRUTAL
                        One of the witnesses showed up a
                        day early.

              Paul turns. Sitting on the door sill, watching them with
              beady eyes, is the mouse. Paul turns back, addresses the room:

                                  PAUL
                        All right, let's go again and do
                        it right this time! Get that idiot
                        out of the chair...

              HIGH WIDE ANGLE OF EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Brutal and Harry start undoing Toot's clamps. Everybody
              relaxes, drifting from their positions...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - NEXT NIGHT

              ...and the room is now quietly filling up with WITNESSES
              trickling in. People speak in whispers, if at all.

              INT. BITTERBUCK'S CELL - NIGHT

              Bitterbuck, the top of his head now shaved, is speaking
              quietly as Paul listens:

                                  BITTERBUCK
                        You think if a man sincerely
                        repents on what he done wrong, he
                        might get to go back to the time
                        that was happiest for him and live
                        there forever? Could that be what
                        heaven is like?

              Paul doesn't think so--but that's not what Bitterbuck needs
              to hear, so the lie comes easy:

                                  PAUL
                        I just about believe that very
                        thing.

              Pause. Bitterbuck smiles.

                                  BITTERBUCK
                        Had me a young wife when I was
                        eighteen. Spent our first summer
                        in the mountains. Made love every
                        night. She'd just lie there after,
                        bare-breasted in the firelight,
                        and we'd talk sometimes till the
                        sun come up.
                               (beat)
                        That was my best time.

              Brutal appears at the door, checks his pocketwatch, nods to
              Paul. Bitterbuck takes a deep breath, getting himself ready.

                                  PAUL
                        It'll be fine. You'll do fine.

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

              THE SPONGE is pulled sopping wet from the bucket of brine,
              dripping a trail of water across the floor. Brutal places it
              atop Bitterbuck's head. Water courses down the sides of the
              condemned man's mask and neck, pooling on the floor.

              The cap is lowered, the straps secured. All we hear now is
              the sound of Bitterbuck's BREATHING growing louder and faster
              under the mask...until, softly:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Roll on two.

              WHAM! The switch is thrown. Bitterbuck surges forward against
              the straps, riding the powerful current.

              Some witnesses turn away. Paul and Brutal maintain grim eye
              contact with each other, waiting.

              Behind the partition, Percy watches through the mesh with
              gleaming eyes, wishing he could see better.

              Van Hay kills the current. Bitterbuck goes limp. A DOCTOR
              steps forward, checks for a heartbeat, shakes his head.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Again.

              The switch is thrown a second time. Bitterbuck surges forward
              again, riding the current all the way...

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              Bitterbuck's dead face stares up at us from a gurney. A hand
              reaches down, gives his cheek a squeeze. TILT UP to:

                                  PERCY
                        Adios, Chief. Drop us a card from
                        hell, let us know if it's hot
                        enough.

              Brutal knocks Percy's hand away, shoves him aside.

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's paid what he's owed. He's
                        square with the house again, so
                        keep your goddamn hands off him.

              He draws the sheet over Bitterbuck's face, wheels the gurney
              down the tunnel. Percy throws a look to Paul.

                                  PERCY
                        What's up his ass?

                                  PAUL
                        You, Percy. Always you.

              Paul brushes past him, but:

                                  PERCY
                        You gotta hate the new boy? That
                        the way it is around here?

                                  PAUL
                               (turns back)
                        Why not just move on? Go to Briar
                        Ridge.
                               (off his look)
                        Yeah, I know about it. Sounds like
                        a good job.

                                  PERCY
                        I might take it, too. Soon as you
                        put me out front.

              Paul cocks his head--excuse me?

                                  PERCY
                        You heard me. I want Brutal's spot
                        for the next execution.

                                  PAUL
                               (beat)
                        What's with you? Seeing a man die
                        isn't enough? You gotta be close
                        enough to smell his nuts cook?

                                  PERCY
                        I wanna be out front, is all. Just
                        one time. Then you'll be rid of me.

                                  PAUL
                        If I say no?

                                  PERCY
                        I might just stick around for
                        good, make me a career of this.

              Paul just shakes his head in wonder and walks away.

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. COFFEY'S CELL - DAY

              Coffey's lying on his bunk, weeping quiet tears. He stirs at
              the sound of GIGGLING. He sits up, peers curiously through
              the bars. Softly:

                                  COFFEY
                        Del?

              AT THE GUARD STATION

              Paul glances up from writing in the daily log. Silence now.
              He goes back to writing--and the GIGGLING comes again.

                                  PAUL
                        Delacroix? That you?

              No answer. Just more giggling. Paul rises, walks down the
              Mile to Delacroix's cell--and stops, staring in through the
              bars.

              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE

              Brutal and Dean are having lunch. Paul pokes his head in.

                                  PAUL
                        You are not gonna believe this.

              RESUME E BLOCK

              The men follow Paul onto the Mile. By now, Del is CACKLING
              WILDLY in his cell. Brutal shoots Paul a look--has he gone
              insane? Paul gestures "see for yourself."

              They arrive at the bars...and find the mouse sitting on Del's
              shoulder. Del looks up, giggling like a kid at Christmas.

                                  DEL
                        Look! I done tame me dat mouse!

                                  PAUL
                        We see that.

                                  DEL
                        Watch dis! Watch what he do!

              He stretches out his left arm. The mouse crawls over the top
              of his head, scampers along his arm to the wrist, turns
              around and scampers back. The guards just stand there,
              staring.

                                  DEL
                        Ain't he sumpthin now? Ain't Mr.
                        Jingles smart?

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Jingles?

                                  DEL
                        Dat his name. He whisper it in my
                        ear. Cap'n, can I have a box for
                        my mouse so he can sleep in here
                        wi' me?

                                  PAUL
                        I notice your English gets better
                        when you want something.

                                  DEL
                        Wanna see what else he can do?
                        Watch, watch, watch...

              He puts the mouse on the floor, grabs a small wooden spool.
              The mouse sees it, poises like a man getting ready for a race.

                                  DEL
                        We play fetch, Mr. Jingles? We
                        play fetch?

              He tosses the spool across the floor, bounces it against the
              wall. The mouse goes after it like a dog after a stick--and
              proceeds to push it back to the bunk, rolling it with its
              front paws all the way to Delacroix's feet.

              By now, the guard's jaws are hanging open. Paul's got a funny
              little chill running up his spine.

                                  DEL
                        He fetch it ever' time. Smart as
                        hell, ain't he? We do da trick
                        again, watch, watch, watch...

              Again he throws the spool. Again the mouse goes after it,
              starts rolling it back. Del howls with laughter, claps his
              hands like a kid. Brutal murmurs to the others:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Who's training who here?

                                  COFFEY
                        That's some smart mouse, Del. Like
                        he's a circus mouse or something.

                                  DEL
                        A circus mouse! Dat jus' what he
                        is, too! A circus mouse! I get
                        outta here, he make me rich, see
                        if he don't!

              He picks up the spool again, makes a drumroll sound, tosses
              it. The mouse does its thing, rolling the spool back...

              ...as Percy enters the scene. Del catches sight of him and
              scoops up his mouse, drawing fearfully back on his bunk. He
              tries to hide Mr. Jingles in his hands--but the mouse
              wriggles from his grasp and scampers up on top of his head,
              where he regards Percy with mistrustful, beady mouse eyes.

                                  PERCY
                        Well, well. Looks like you found
                        yourself a new friend, Eddie.

              Del tries to offer some defiance--but all he can manage is:

                                  DEL
                        Don' hurt him, 'kay? 'kay?

              Percy shrugs as if to say "no skin off me", looks to Paul.

                                  PERCY
                        That the one I chased?

                                  PAUL
                               (level)
                        Yes, that's the one. Only Del says
                        his name is Mr. Jingles.

                                  PERCY
                        Is that so?

              Paul trades a look with the others, everybody wondering just
              what the hell's going through Percy's mind.

                                  PAUL
                        Del was just asking for a box. He
                        thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
                        I guess. That he might keep it for
                        a pet. What do you think?

                                  PERCY
                        I think it'll shit up his nose
                        some night and run away, but I
                        guess that's Del's lookout.
                               (beat)
                        We oughtta find a cigar box. Get
                        some cotton batting from he
                        dispensary to line it with. That
                        should do real nice.

              Percy walks away, leaving them dumbstruck. Paul turns to the
              others. Of all the things they've seen in the last few
              minutes, Percy being nice is the most amazing of all.

                                  PAUL
                        Man said get a cigar box.

              INT. WARDEN MOORES' OFFICE - DAY

              ...and enters to find Hal staring out the window.

                                  PAUL
                        Hal? You wanted to see me?

                                  HAL
                        Yeah. Paul. Close the door.

              Hal's speech is halting, his thoughts disjointed and slow:

                                  HAL
                        Uh. So you know. You got a new
                        prisoner coming in tomorrow.
                        William Wharton. Young kid. Wild
                        as hell, judging from this...

              He picks up the report, trying to focus his thoughts:

                                  HAL
                        ...been rambling all over the
                        state last few years, causing all
                        kinds of trouble. Finally hit big
                        time. Killed three people in a
                        holdup, including a pregnant
                        woman. Got "Billy the Kid"
                        tattooed on his left arm...bad
                        news all around...

              He trails off, no longer able to focus on the words. Paul is
              shocked to see tears spill silently down his cheeks.

                                  PAUL
                        Hal?

                                  HAL
                        It's a tumor, Paul. A brain tumor.

              Paul doesn't know what to say. Hal looks at him.

                                  HAL
                        They got X-ray pictures of it.
                        It's the size of a lemon, they
                        said, and way down deep inside
                        where they can't operate. They say
                        she'll be dead by Christmas. I
                        haven't told her. I can't think
                        how. For the life of me, Paul, I
                        can't think how to tell my wife
                        she's going to die.

              Hal Moores, one of the toughest and steadiest men you'd ever
              meets, starts to cry. He dissolves into great big gasping
              sobs, losing all control.

              Paul lies awake, watching Jan sleep. He looks troubled--not
              to mention feverish. It occurs to him how badly he has to
              pee. He sits up, clutching at a queasy stab of pain in his
              groin...

              LIVING ROOM STAIRS

              ...and comes hurrying down the steps, clutching himself...

              EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

              ...and he's moving even faster as he exits the kitchen,
              racing for the outhouse. He realizes he's not going to make
              it, stops to piss near the woodpile at the corner of the
              house...

              ...and as he does, he's hit with the most stunning pain of
              his life. He buckles to his knees--it's only his flailing
              hand against the woodpile that prevents him from going face-
              first into his own piss. He crams his other hand to his mouth
              in an enormous effort not to scream and wake his wife.

              He manages to ride it out until his bladder empties. He falls
              onto his side, rolls over on the grass, and stares up at the
              sky with both hands pressed to his groin.

              how sick he is.

                                  PAUL

              staring out the window, wearing a hospital gown, his face
              utterly blank. He looks heavily medicated.

              Harry, Dean, and Percy enter. Billy doesn't react, just keeps
              staring out. Harry waves his fingers in Billy's face.

                                  HARRY
                        Boy's doped to the gills. Dean,
                        hand me them clothes...

              Dean relays some folded prison clothes to Harry.

                                  HARRY
                        William Wharton! Hey! I'm talking
                        to you! Put these clothes on!

              Billy turns with a vacant look, takes the clothes. He fumbles
              with the shirt, drops the pants. Harry and Dean sigh.

              They strip Billy's hospital gown off and proceed to put the
              shirt on him, guiding his limp arms through the sleeves.

                                  PERCY

              calls softly from further down the Mile:

              his slack mouth in long strings.

              The rear doors are swung open. Harry emerges. Dean and Percy
              are guiding Billy by the arm, helping him down...

              INSIDE E BLOCK

              Paul waits at the empty cell. ANGLE PANS TIGHT to Coffey at
              his bars, eyes widening in a blossoming of some nameless fear
              or dread. Something bad's coming. A whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        Careful.

              Billy is brought to the door. Dean pulls his keys, starts to
              unlock it. We PUSH IN on Billy's face, where the tiniest
              trace of a smile is starting to grow...

              INSIDE E BLOCK

              ...and Coffey's unease grows with it. he presses his face to

                        Careful. Careful.

              Paul hears him, glances back with a puzzled look. Coffey's
              gaze is directed at the door, which is being unlocked...

              THE DOOR

              ...and opened. In that moment, the slack look on Billy's face
              gives way to a wild grin. A CRAZED SCREECH leaps from his
              throat, a cross between a rebel yell and a dog being
              tortured, freezing everybody's blood in their veins--

                                  BILLY
                        Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!

              --and he drops his wrist-chain down over Dean's head, jerks
              it tight, begins to strangle him. Dean lurches forward, Billy
              riding/propelling him through the door onto the Mile.

              Percy stands frozen in the doorway, stunned. Harry shoves him
              aside and jumps on Billy from behind, trying to get him off
              Dean. Dean is choking, turning purple.

              Paul rushes from the cell to join the fray. Billy whirls,
              delivering a stunning kick to Paul's groin. Paul's bladder
              pain goes nuclear--he falls back in agony, clutching himself
              and sucking air through his teeth, unable even to scream.

              Billy rams an elbow into Harry's face, knocks him sprawling
              on the desk, screaming and laughing and howling all the while:

                                  BILLY
                        WHOOOEE, BOYS! AIN'T THIS A PARTY,
                        NOW? IS IT, OR WHAT?

              Paul forces himself to his feet, pulls his revolver, draws
              down on Billy...

                                  PAUL
                        LET HIM GO!

              ...but Billy jerks Dean around, using him as a shield...

                                  BILLY
                        G'WAN, SHOOT! SEE WHO YA HIT!

              Dean is choking, dying. Paul is shifting his aim, trying for
              a clear shot, not getting one. Percy's still just inside the
              doorway, pressed against the wall with fear...

                                  PAUL
                        HIT HIM, PERCY! GODDAMN IT, HIT
                        HIM!

                                  BILLY
                        C'MON, PERCY, HIT ME! HIT ME, YOU
                        LIMP NOODLE, HIT ME! YEEHAWWW!

              ...and suddenly a hand comes in, grabs the hickory stick out
              of Percy's grasp, raises it high--

              --it's Brutal coming through the door. He swings the baton
              and lands an awesome blow to Billy's head--THUMP! The force
              of it spins Billy off his feet and slams him flat on his back.

              Dean crawls away, gulping ragged breaths of air. Amazingly,
              Billy's still conscious--he looks up at Brutal and laughs:

                                  BILLY
                        Big fucker. Snuck up on me. No
                        fair.

              Still laughing, he makes another grab at Dean. Brutal whacks
              him again, turning his lights out for good. Brutal drops to
              Dean's side, helping him hack air back into his lungs:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Breathe...breathe...that's it...

              Everybody's reining in their adrenaline. Paul glares at Harry.

                                  HARRY
                        We thought he was doped.
                               (to Percy)
                        Didn't we? Didn't we all of us
                        think he was doped?

              Percy nods, still numb. Paul is furious:

                                  PAUL
                        You didn't ask? I guess that's not
                        a mistake you'll be need to make
                        again anytime soon, is it?

              Harry shakes his head miserably. Paul grabs Billy by the feet.

                                  PAUL
                        Grab his arms! You too, Percy!
                               (off Percy's
                                hesitation)
                        Percy, goddamn it, get your feet
                        out of cement and help us out here!

              Percy finally unfreezes. The three of them hoist Billy up in
              a dead-lift, get him in his cell, toss him on the cot. They
              step out, slam the door, lock it. Paul looks to Harry and
              Brutal.

                                  PAUL
                        Get Dean looked at right away,
                        make sure he's all right.

                        Percy, you go make a report to the
                        warden for me. Start off by saying
                        the situation is under control--
                        it's not a story, he won't
                        appreciate you drawing out the
                        suspense.

                                  BRUTAL
                        What about you? You look about
                        ready to collapse.

                                  PAUL
                        I've got the Mile till you all get
                        back. Go on now.

              They all exit. As soon as he's alone, Paul gives in to the
              pain, holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a
              moan. It's so bad he actually lays down on the Mile, face
              pressed against the cool linoleum, wishing he were dead. A
              stretch of silence...and then:

                                  COFFEY (O.S.)
                        Boss? Needs ta see ya down here.

                                  PAUL
                        This is not a good time, John
                        Coffey. Not a good time at all.

                                  COFFEY (O.S.)
                        But I needs ta see ya, boss. I
                        needs ta talk t'ya.

              Paul sighs. Things couldn't get much worse than this. He
              rises with a supreme effort, walks painfully down the Mile...

              COFFEY'S CELL

              ...and finds Coffey waiting at his bars.

                                  COFFEY
                        Closer.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm alone here right now, John.
                        Figure this is close enough.

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss, please. I got to whisper in
                        your ear.

              Paul blinks. Maybe it's the fever clouding his brain, or
              maybe...hell, is this what being hypnotized is like? He tries
              to shake the sensation off, comes a little closer.

                                  DEL
                        Boss? You know you not s'pose to
                        do dat.

                                  PAUL
                        Mind your business, Del. What do
                        you want, John Coffey?

                                  COFFEY
                        Just to help.

              His hand shoots out, grabs Paul by the collar, jerks him
              close. Paul makes a panic-grab for his revolver...

              ...but Coffey lays his free hand atop Paul's, eases his grip
              from the gun--no need for that. Coffey's hand then drifts
              slowly down, easing to Paul's crotch...

                                  PAUL
                               (stunned, frozen)
                        What are you...doing?

              ...and something goes WHUMP through Paul's body. He arches
              back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of
              energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffey's hand...

              ...and then it's over. Paul comes back to the real world,
              weak against the bars, realizes Del is hollering in his cell:

                                  DEL
                        HELP! JOHN COFFEY'S KILLING BOSS
                        EDGECOMB! HELP!

                                  PAUL
                        Del, Chrissake, settle down, I'm
                        fine...

              It dawns on him that he really is fine. Fever's gone. So is
              the pain in his groin. John Coffey, though, seems to be
              having trouble. He sits down on his bunk, bends forward,
              gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat.

                                  PAUL
                        John? John, what's wrong?

              Paul fumbles his keys to the lock, unsure if he should open
              the door, watching the big man's contortions grow stronger
              like a cat trying to cough up a hairball...

              ...and then comes an unpleasant, gagging/retching sound as
              Coffey's lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful
              sneer...and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black
              insects. They swirl furiously in front of his face, turn
              white...and disappear. Paul just stares, stunned. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        What did you do, big boy? What did
                        you do to me?

                                  COFFEY
                        I helped it. Didn't I help it?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, but...how?

              Coffey shrugs--it's something that just is.

                                  COFFEY
                        Just took it back, is all. Awful
                        tired now, boss. Dog tired.

              He rolls onto his bunk, faces the wall. Paul just stares at
              him, stunned. He turns and walks up the Mile, his stiffness
              and pain now gone. Del watches him go by, also stunned:

                                  DEL
                        What dat man do to you? He throw
                        some gris-gris on you?
                               (off Paul's look)
                        You look diff'int! Even walk
                        diff'int. Like y'all better!

                                  PAUL
                        You're imagining thing. Lie down,
                        Del. Get you some rest.

              Paul continues up the Mile...

              E BLOCK TOILET

              ...and steps back into the toilet. Not trusting this
              situation for even a moment, Paul opens his fly, takes a deep
              breath to prepare himself for the pain, starts to pee...

              ...and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the bowl.
              The look on Paul's face says it all--blessed relief.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK

              Paul comes home from work, still looking numb about the whole
              thing. He drifts to the kitchen door. Jan's at the counter,
              slicing vegetables for dinner. She glances at him.

                                  JAN
                        Hi, honey. How are you feeling?

                                  PAUL
                        Um...not too bad.

              She turns back. Paul's eyes drift down to admire her ass.

                                  JAN
                        What did the doctor say?

              No response. He's too busy staring. She turns again--he
              glances hastily up.

                                  PAUL
                        Oh, you know doctors. Gobble-de-
                        gook mostly.

              She turns back, keeps working. He crosses the room, eyeing
              her ass all the way...and surprised her by pressing up
              against her from behind, running his hands along her hips.

                                  JAN
                        Paul? What are you doing?

              He starts laying kisses on the back of her neck, giving her
              pleasant shivers, murmuring:

                                  PAUL
                        What's it feel like?

                                  JAN
                        I know what it feels like...it
                        feels great...but...Paul...

              He's getting her breathless. She turns into his arms and they
              get into some passionate kissing. It's not too long before
              they're frantically peeling each other's clothes off...

              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

              ...and we find them having a wild tumble in the sheets, both
              moaning and groaning, sweating and panting. She pushes him
              flat on the bed, pauses to catch her breath...

                                  JAN
                        Those must've been some pills.

              ...and they keep going, rutting like crazed weasels...

              EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

              ...as their moans go drifting into the night...

                                                       FADE TO:

              SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - DAWN

              ...and they're still moaning up there as the sun creeps up.

              INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

              Jan falls back, exhausted after the latest go-round. She
              catches her breath, looks over at Paul, and finally:

                                  JAN
                        Paul? Not that I'm complaining.
                        But we haven't gone four times in
                        one night since we were nineteen.
                               (off his look)
                        You wanna tell me just what the
                        hell's going on?

                                  PAUL
                        Well...thing is...I never actually
                        got to the doctor yesterday...

              She gives him a look--oh?

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

              Paul is on the phone:

                                  PAUL
                        Brutal? Listen...I'm thinking of
                        taking the morning off sick. You
                        cover the fort for me?
                               (beat)
                        That's swell. Thanks. Yeah, I'm
                        sure I'll feel better. Okay.

              He hangs up, turns to Jan.

                                  JAN
                        You sure you ought to do this?

                                  PAUL
                        I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. ROAD TO TEFTON - DAY

              Paul's model T comes putt-putting up the road past a sign:
              "Trapingus County Welcomes You."

              EXT. HOUSE IN TEFTON - BACK PORCH - DAY

              BURT HAMMERSMITH, public defender for Trapingus County, sits
              with a cold soda and a magazine, watching his TWO CHILDREN
              playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard. The screen
              door opens and CYNTHIA HAMMERSMITH ushers Paul out.

                                  CYNTHIA
                        I offer you a cold drink?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be
                        fine. Thank you.

              She goes back inside. Burt rises.

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Hammersmith. Your office said
                        I'd find you at home today. I hope
                        I'm not troubling you.

                                  BURT
                        That depends, Mr.--?

                                  PAUL
                        Paul Edgecomb. I'm the E Block
                        superintendant at Cold Mountain.

                                  BURT
                        The Green Mile. I've heard of it.
                        Lost a few clients your way.

                                  PAUL
                        That's why I'm here. I'd like to
                        ask you about one of them.

              Burt settles back down, motions "please sit".

                                  BURT
                        Which client? Now you got my
                        curiosity aroused.

                                  PAUL
                        John Coffey.

                                  BURT
                        Ah, Coffey. He causing you
                        problems?

                                  PAUL
                        No, can't say he is. He doesn't
                        like the dark. He cries on
                        occasion. Other than that...

                                  BURT
                        Cries, does he? Well, he's got a
                        lot to cry about, I'd say. You
                        know what he did.

                                  PAUL
                               (nods)
                        I read the court transcripts.

              Cynthia reappears, hands Paul a cold root beer.

                                  PAUL
                        Thank you, Missus.

                                  CYNTHIA
                        My pleasure. Kids! Lunch is about
                        ready! Y'all come on up!

              She goes back inside, but the kids aren't quite able to tear
              themselves away from their play.

                                  BURT
                        What exactly are you trying to
                        find out? Satisfy my curiosity,
                        I'll see if I can satisfy yours.

                                  PAUL
                        I've wondered if he ever did
                        anything like that before.

                                  BURT
                        Why? Has he said anything?

                                  PAUL
                        No. But a man who does a thing
                        like that has often developed a
                        taste for it over time. Occurred
                        to me it might be easy enough to
                        follow his backtrail and find out.
                        A man his size, and colored to
                        boot, can't be that hard to trace.

                                  BURT
                        You'd think so, but you'd be
                        wrong. Believe me, we tried. It's
                        like he dropped out of the sky.

                                  PAUL
                        How do you explain that?

                                  BURT
                        We're in a Depression. A third of
                        the country's out of work.

                        People are drifting by the
                        thousands, looking for work,
                        looking for that greener grass.
                        Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't
                        get noticed everywhere he goes...
                        not until he kills a couple of
                        little girls.

                                  PAUL
                        He's...strange, I admit. But there
                        doesn't seem to be any real
                        violence in him. I know violent
                        men, Mr. Hammersmith. I deal with
                        'em day in and day out.

              Burt smiles, realizing:

                                  BURT
                        You didn't come up here to ask me
                        whether he might have killed
                        before. You came up here to see if
                        I think he did it at all. That's
                        it, isn't it?

                                  PAUL
                        Do you?

                                  BURT
                        One seldom sees a less ambiguous
                        case. He was found with the
                        victims in his arms. Blurted out
                        a confession right then and there.

                                  PAUL
                        Yet you defended him.

                                  BURT
                        Everyone is entitled to a defense.

              Cynthia hollers from an open window:

                                  CYNTHIA
                        Kids! Lunch!

                                  BURT
                        Y'all listen to your Momma, now!

              The kids start this way. Burt turns back to Paul.

                                  BURT
                        Tell you something. You listen
                        close, too, because it might be
                        something you need to know.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm listening.

                                  BURT
                        We had us a dog. No particular
                        breed, but gentle. Ready to lick
                        your hand or fetch a stick. Just
                        a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.
                               (Paul nods)
                        In many way, a good mongrel dog is
                        like you negro. You get to know
                        it, and often you get to love it.
                        It is of no particular use, but
                        you keep it around because you
                        think it loves you. If you're
                        lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never
                        have to find out any different. My
                        wife and I were not so lucky.
                        Caleb. Come here for a second.

              The little boy comes to him, staring at his feet. Burt tires
              to raise the boy's chin. The boy resists for a moment...

                                  BURT
                        Please, son.

              ...and then his face comes around. He's horribly scarred on
              that side, the eye missing.

                                  BURT
                        He has the one eye. I suppose he's
                        lucky not to be blind. We get down
                        on our knees and thank God for
                        that much at least. Right Caleb?
                               (the boy nods shyly)
                        Okay, go on in now.

              The boy races inside after his sister. Paul follows Burt's
              gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied
              doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.

                                  BURT
                        That dog attacked my boy for no
                        reason. Just got it into his mind
                        one day. Same with John Coffey. He
                        was sorry afterwards, of that I
                        have no doubt...but those little
                        girls stayed raped and murdered
                        nonetheless. Maybe he's never done
                        it before--my dog never bit
                        before, but I didn't concern
                        myself with that. I went out there
                        with my rifle and grabbed his
                        collar and blew his brains out.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm sorry for your trouble.

              Burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.

                                  BURT
                        I'm as enlightened as the next
                        man, Mr. Edgecomb. I would not
                        bring back slavery for all the tea
                        in China. I believe we have to be
                        humane and generous in our efforts
                        to solve the race problem. But we
                        have to remember that the negro
                        will bite if he gets the chance,
                        just like a mongrel dog will bite
                        if it crosses its mind to do so.
                               (beat)
                        Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is.
                        Don't you doubt it, and don't you
                        turn your back on him. You might
                        get away with it once or even a
                        hundred times...but in the end...

              He raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.

                                  BURT
                        You understand?

              Paul says nothing. Burt gazes out again. Softly:

                                  BURT
                        I'm gonna have to tear that old
                        doghouse down one of these days.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S MODEL T - DAY

              Paul drives back to Cold Mountain, his heart conflicted...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              ...and he walks onto the Mile with a bundle wrapped in a dish
              towel. Brutal glances up from the desk, sniffing the air.

                                  PAUL
                        No, it's not for you.

              Paul continues down the Mile. Whatever he's carrying, the
              smell of it brings Del to his bars. Even Mr.Jingles comes
              skittering out of his cigar box, sniffing.

                                  DEL
                        Oh. Oh my.

              Paul arrives at Coffey's cell. Coffey's on his bunk facing
              the wall. His head comes around, drawn by the aroma. He sits
              up, wipes the tears leaking from his eyes, looks at Paul.

                                  COFFEY
                        I'm smelling me some cornbread.

              Paul speaks softly so the others can't hear:

                                  PAUL
                        It's from my missus. She wanted to
                        thank you.

              Coffey nods thoughtfully, absorbing this notion. Then:

                                  COFFEY
                        Thank me for what?

                                  PAUL
                        You know. For helping me.

                                  COFFEY
                        Helping you with what?

              Paul motions discreetly to his crotch.

                                  COFFEY
                        Ohhh.
                               (beat)
                        Was your missus pleased?

                                  PAUL
                        Several times.

              Paul hands him the bundle through the bars. Coffey takes it,
              uncovers the cornbread reverently, gazes back up.

                                  COFFEY
                        This all for me?

              Paul nods. Across the way, Del is pressing his face longingly
              through the bars while Mr. Jingles crawls on his shoulder.

                                  DEL
                        Oh my. John, I can smell it from
                        here. I surely can.

                                  COFFEY
                               (looks to Paul)
                        Can I give some to Del?

                                  PAUL
                        It's yours, John. You do with it
                        as you please.

              John carefully scoops a big chunk of cornbread out with his
              enormous hand, holds it through the bars to Paul.

                                  COFFEY
                        Here's for Del and Mr. Jingles
                        then.

                                  BILLY
                        Hey! What about me? I'm'a get some
                        too, ain't I

              Coffey looks to Paul--do I have to?

                                  PAUL
                        It's yours, John. As you please.

                                  COFFEY
                        Well. Fine. I think I'll keep the
                        rest, then.

              He smiles like a big kid, digging in with his fingers. Paul
              crosses the Mile to Del's cell, hands him his share.

                                  PAUL
                        Courtesy of the gentleman across
                        the way.

                                  DEL
                        Oh, John. So very fine of you. So
                        very kind. Mr. Jingles t'ank you.

                                  COFFEY
                               (mouth full)
                        ...wel'cm...

                                  BILLY
                        Hey! What about me? Don't you hold
                        out on me, ya big dummy nigger!

              Paul's temper flares--he steps to Billy's cell.

                                  PAUL
                        You'll keep a civil tongue on my
                        block.

              Beat. Billy spits in Paul's face and follows it up with a big
              grin--what are you gonna do about that? Paul is seething as
              he wipes the spit off, but keeps his temper where it belongs.

                                  PAUL
                        You get that one for free. But
                        that's the last one.

              Paul walks away. Billy laughs, hollering after him:

                                  BILLY
                        That's it? Just that little bitty
                        one? Guess I'll have to pay out
                        for the rest, huh?

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Harry is walking the Mile, doing a cell check and jotting on
              a clipboard. He pauses, making a notation...

              ...and a long stream of piss hits his leg. Billy's at his
              bars, peeing on him. Harry jumps back, stunned. Billy howls
              with laughter, hosing his aim wildly from side to side.

                                  BILLY
                        Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren't it?
                        Oh, the look on your face!

              Paul and Brutal come running. Harry's just flabbergasted:

                                  HARRY
                        You believe this? Son of a bitch
                        pissed on me!

                                  BILLY
                        Hey, d'jall like that? I'm
                        currently cooking some turds t'go
                        with it! Nice soft ones! I'll have
                        'em out t'yall tomorrow!

              Paul stays calm, turns to Brutal, nods at the restraint room.

                                  PAUL
                        We've been looking to clear that
                        room out anyway.

                                                       TIMECUT:

              A STREAM OF GUARDS comes toting the last of the restraint
              room stuff past Billy's cell while he heckles them from the
              bars...

                                  BILLY
                        Hey! Whassit now, movin' day?
                        Y'all wanna come in and dust a
                        little? Y'can shine my knob for me
                        while yer at it!

              ...and he pauses as Paul and Brutal step to the bars. Paul
              has a canvas straitjacket. Brutal pulls his nightstick.

                                  BILLY
                        You can come in here on your legs,
                        but you'll go out on your backs,
                        Billy the Kid guarantee ya that.
                               (motions to Brutal)
                        C'mon, fuckstick. No sneakin' up
                        on me this time. We'll go man to
                        man, see who's the better fel--

              Brutal unlocks the cell--and sidesteps, revealing Harry
              pointing a fire hose. The hose erupts, driving Billy across
              the cell with bone-jarring force. They batter him half-
              senseless, then cut the water. Billy collapses in a heap.

              Paul and Brutal drag him semi-conscious from his cell and get
              the straitjacket on him. He comes around as they draw the
              straps tight and pull him to his feet.

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, Wild Bill. Little walky
                        walky.

                                  BILLY
                        Don't you call me that! Wild Bill
                        Hickock wasn't no range rider! He
                        was just a bushwackin' John Law!
                        Dumb sonovabitch sat with his back
                        to the door and kilt by a drunk!

                                  BRUTAL
                        Oh, my suds and body! A history
                        lesson! You just never know what
                        you're gonna get when you come to
                        work everyday on the Green Mile.
                        Thank you, Wild Bill.

              Billy lets out a scream of rage and throws himself at Brutal.
              Brutal, bored, shoves him back toward Paul, who then propels
              him down the Mile toward the open restraint room door. Billy
              sees where they intend to put him, resorts to pleading:

                                  BILLY
                        Oh, not in there! C'mon now, I'll
                        be good! Honest Injun I will! No!
                        No! Ummmmhhhh...urg...ah!

              He suddenly drops to the floor, bucking and jerking wildly,
              spewing drool. Harry's eyes go wide.

                                  HARRY
                        Holy Christ, he's pitchin' a fit!

              Paul reaches down and unceremoniously starts dragging Billy
              kicking and writhing the rest of the way.

                                  PAUL
                        He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on
                        this one.

              Brutal helps Paul toss Billy headlong into the padded room.
              They slam the door...

              RESTRAINT ROOM

              ...and Billy staggers to his feet in the straitjacket,
              inarticulate with rage, starts throwing himself against the
              door, screaming at the top of his lungs.

                                  BILLY
                        ALL I WANTED ME WAS A LITTLE
                        CORNBREAD, YOU MUTHERFUCKERS!

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NEXT DAY

              Paul and Brutal unlock the restraint room. Billy looks up
              from the corner, pale and drained. Softly:

                                  BILLY
                        I learnt my lesson. I'll be good.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Billy's back in his cell, quiet for a change. Toot-Toot is
              outside the bars, mopping the floor. Billy notices a
              chocolate Moon Pie in Toot's shirt pocket.

                                  BILLY
                        Pssss. Hey. Give'ya nickel for
                        that Moon Pie.

              Toot looks around. Nobody's watching, and a nickel's a
              nickel. He steps to Billy's bars, swaps the Moon Pie for the
              money.

              Toot hurries away. Billy unwraps the Moon Pie, makes sure
              he's not being watched...and crams the entire thing into his
              mouth...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and here comes Brutal strolling down the Mile, doing a
              cell check and jotting on a clipboard. He pauses, seeing:

              Billy at his bars. Just standing there staring. His cheeks
              bulging way out.

              Brutal steps closer, fascinated...what the fuck is that.
              Billy waits until he's just a bit closer--

              --and he slams his fists against his own cheeks, propelling
              a disgusting spew of liquefied chocolate sludge into Brutal's
              face. Billy falls back onto his bunk, shrieking with laughter:

                                  BILLY
                        Li'l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss,
                        yassuh, howdoo you do?

                                  BRUTAL
                               (beat, calmly)
                        Hope your bags are packed.

                                                       TIMECUT:

              ...and once again, Billy gets dragged to the restraint room,
              kicking and screaming all the way. They toss him in, slam the
              door. Brutal turns, still wiping traces of sludge off.

                                  PAUL
                        The Moon Pie thing was pretty
                        original. Gotta give him that.

              Brutal nods. They walk away as we

                                                       FADE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              Paul and Brutal appear at Del's bars with Harry and Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Del, grab your things. Big day for
                        you and Mr. Jingles.

                                  DEL
                        Whatchoo talkin' bout?

                                  PAUL
                        Important folks heard about your
                        mouse, wanna see him perform. Not
                        just guards, either. One of them's
                        a politician all the way from the
                        state capital, I believe.

              Del swells with pride upon hearing this. He scrounges up Mr.
              Jingles props, steps from his cell, looks to Harry and Dean.

                                  DEL
                        You fellas comin'?

                                  HARRY
                        We got other fish to fry just now,
                        Del, but you knock 'em for a loop.

              Del nods, beaming happily, looks to Coffey in his cell.

                                  COFFEY
                        You knock 'em for a loop like Mr.
                        Harry says, Del.

              Brutal leads Del up the Mile, Paul and the others at their
              heels. Percy's at the duty desk. He smirks and rolls his eyes
              as Del goes by. The moment Brutal and Del are out the door...

              ...Toot emerges from Paul's office where he's been hiding.

                                  PAUL
                        Let's move along briskly, folks.
                        There's not much time.

              Toot hurries down to take his place in Del's cell.

                                  TOOT
                        I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin'
                        down, I'm sittin' down.

              INT. OFFICE/ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY

              A HALF DOZEN GUARDS are waiting. We find Bill Dodge fixing
              the tie of a fat good ol' boy named EARL.

                                  EARL
                        Been sweepin' floors here ten
                        years, never had to wear no damn
                        tie before.

                                  BILL
                        You're a V.I.P. today, Earl, so
                        just shut up.

              A KNOCK at the door. Everybody takes a seat. Del is ushered
              in by Brutal. Del faces his audience, puts his hands to his
              chest in a "thank you" gesture worthy of Lillie Langtry
              before her adoring public, then announces grandly:

                                  DEL
                        Messieurs et mesdames! Bienvenue
                        au cirque de mousie!

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - DAY

              The steel cap is lowered over Toot's head, the straps
              tightened. TILT UP to Percy as:

                                  PERCY
                        Roll on two.

              Behind his partition, Van Hay mimes flipping the switch.

                                  VAN HAY
                        That's that.

              A pause. Percy looks anxiously to Paul, who's trading glances
              with the other guards. Finally:

                                  PAUL
                        Very good. Very professional.

              Percy smiles. Harry and Dean step up, slapping his back and
              shaking his hand...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAY

              ...and they're still chatting a short time later, waiting for
              Del's return. Percy actually looks happy for a change,
              feeling genuinely accepted for the first time...

              Billy is watching from his cell. Just watching.

              The door opens. Del returns with Mr. Jingles on his shoulder,
              escorted by Brutal. Brutal is toting the cigar box and spool
              like a magician's assistant carrying the boss' props.

                                  PAUL
                        Well?

                                  DEL
                        They love Mr. Jingles! They laugh
                        and cheer and clap they hands!

                                  PERCY
                        Well, that's just aces. Pop back
                        in your cell, old-timer.

              The generosity of Percy's tone catches Del completely off
              guard. Del gives him a look of almost comical mistrust...

              ...and the old Percy comes back. He bares his teeth in a mock
              snarl and curls his fingers as if to grab Del. It's a joke,
              but Del doesn't know that--he jerks back in fear and trips
              over Brutal's big feet. Del goes down hard, hitting the
              linoleum with the back of his head. Mr. Jingles jumps clear,
              goes squeaking down the Mile. Del sits up, painfully
              clutching his head. Brutal helps him up...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Percy, you shit.

              ...and moves him toward his cell. Percy is actually moved to
              apologize--he starts after them with a half-laugh, drifting
              much too close to Wild Bill's side of the Mile...

                                  PERCY
                        Del! Hey, you numb wit, I didn't
                        mean nothin' by it! You all ri--

              ...and Wild Bill's arms thrust out, grabbing Percy and
              slamming him back against the bars with an arm around his
              throat. Percy squeals like a pig in a slaughter-chute,
              thinking he's gonna die. The guards scramble, drawing their
              clubs--as Billy strokes Percy's hair and whispers in his ear:

                                  BILLY
                        Ain't you sweet. Soft. Like a
                        girl. I druther fuck your asshole
                        than your sister's pussy, I think.

              Billy kisses Percy's ear--and his hand drops down to squeeze
              Percy's crotch. Paul pulls his sidearm, taking aim...

                                  PAUL
                        Wharton!

              ...and Billy lets go, stepping back with his hands raised,
              laughing. Percy darts across the Mile in terror and cringes
              against the cell opposite, breathing so loud and fast it
              almost sounds like sobbing.

                                  BILLY
                        I let 'im go, I'us just playin'
                        and I let 'im go! Never hurt a
                        hair on his purty head!
                               (grins at Percy)
                        Your noodle ain't limp at all,
                        loverboy! I think you sweet on ol'
                        Billy the Kid...
                               (sniffs his fingers)
                        ...oooh, but smell you.

              Down at his cell, Del starts laughing shrilly. Everybody else
              starts to realize it, including Percy himself...he looks
              down, sees the huge dark stain spreading at his crotch.

                                  DEL
                        Lookit, he done piss his pants!
                        Look what the big man done! He
                        bus' other people wid 'is stick,
                        mais oui some mauvais homme, but
                        someone touch him, he make water
                        in his pants jus' like a baby!

              Percy just stares. Brutal shoves Delacroix into his cell.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Shut up, Del.

              Paul steps to Percy, puts a hand on his shoulder. Percy
              shakes his hand off, looks around at their faces, whispers:

                                  PERCY
                        You talk about this to anyone,
                        I'll get you all fired. I swear
                        that to God.

                                  PAUL
                        What happens on the Mile, stays on
                        the Mile. Always has.

              The men nod solemnly. Nobody's going to talk about this.
              Percy looks at Delacroix still snorting in his cell, points
              at him.

                                  PERCY
                        You keep laughing, you French-
                        fried faggot. You just keep
                        laughing.

              Del falls silent. Percy turns and storms away as we

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                          "The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. DEL'S CELL - DAY

              Paul is sitting with Delacroix. Brutal is leaning against the
              bars. Del is throwing the spool. Mr. Jingles is fetching it.

              The silence is thick. Just the clack-clatter of the spool,
              and the skitter skitter of tiny mouse paws on concrete. It's
              getting on Paul's nerves in a big way. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        What about Dean? He's got a little
                        boy would love a pet mouse, I bet.

              Del looks horrified at the thought.

                                  DEL
                        How could a boy be trust wid Mr.
                        Jingles? Maybe forget to feed him.
                        And how he keep up wid his
                        trainin', just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

              Del tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter-skitter.

                                  PAUL
                        All right, I'll take him.

                                  DEL
                        T'ank you kindly, merci beaucoup,
                        but you live out in the woods, and
                        Mr. Jingles, he be scared to live
                        out dans la foret.

                                  PAUL
                        He whisper that in your ear?

              Del nods, tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter
              skitter. Paul is completely out of ideas. But then:

                                  BRUTAL
                        How about Mouseville?

                                  DEL
                        Mouseville?

                                  BRUTAL
                        Tourist attraction down in
                        Florida. Tallahassee, I think. Is
                        that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

                                  PAUL
                               (level)
                        Yeah, that's right. Tallahassee.
                        Just down the road apiece from the
                        dog university.

              Brutal's mouth twitches, but he manages to keep a straight
              face. He gives Paul a look--don't blow this.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?
                        You think he's got the stuff?

                                  PAUL
                        Might. He's pretty smart.

                                  DEL
                        Hey! What dis Mouseville?

                                  BRUTAL
                        Tourist attraction, I said. They
                        got this big tent you go into--

                                  DEL
                        Like a cirque? You have to pay?

                                  BRUTAL
                        You shittin' me? Course you pay.
                        Dime a piece, two cents for the
                        kids. And inside the tent there's
                        this mouse city made out of boxes
                        and toilet paper rolls...

              Percy is drifting up the block, listening too, but nobody's
              really paying him much mind.

                                  BRUTAL
                        ...plus they got the Mouseville
                        All-Star Circus. There's mice that
                        swing on trapeze, mice that roll
                        barrels, mice that stack coins...

                                  DEL
                        Dat's it! Dat's da place for Mr.
                        Jingles! You gonna be a circus
                        mouse after all! Gonna live in a
                        mouse city down in Florida!

              Del tosses the spool extra hard--it takes a bad bounce off
              the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the Mile.
              The mouse goes after it like a shot, too intent to notice:

              His old enemy Percy.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Percy, no!

              Percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on Mr.
              Jingles. There's a SOFT SNAP as the mouse's back breaks.

              Del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars, sobbing
              the mouse's name. Percy looks to Brutal and Paul, smiles.

                                  PERCY
                        Knew I'd get him sooner or later.
                        Just a matter of time, really.

              He turns and strolls up the Mile, leaving Mr. Jingles dying
              in a tiny pool of blood. Up at the duty desk, Dean and Harry
              get up from a cribbage game, stunned and furious.

              Percy strolls past, exits to the execution chamber. Del is
              still screaming, all his pent-up terror and grief pouring out
              at the dying mouse. And then comes a soft, urgent voice:

                                  COFFEY
                        Give'm to me.

              They turn. Coffey's got his arms out through his bars, one
              massive hand spread open.

                                  COFFEY
                        Give'm to me. Might still be time.

              Paul hesitates, scoops the mouse up off the floor, wincing at
              the feel of it. Splintered bones are poking at the hide.

                                  BRUTAL
                        What are you doing?

              Paul doesn't answer, just lays Mr. Jingles into Coffey's
              hand. Coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his
              other hand gently over it, cupping the creature. All we see
              now is the tail hanging out the side, twitching weakly.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul, what the hell--

              Paul motions him quiet. Del is pleading softly at his bars:

                                  DEL
                        Please, John. Oh Johnny, help him,
                        please help him, s'il vous plait.

              Harry and Dean join the group. Everybody watching now.

              Coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands, inhales sharply.
              The world hangs suspended for a moment. Coffey raises his
              face, contorting as if desperately ill, starts making those
              horrendous choking sounds in his throat...

                                  BRUTAL
                               (softly)
                        Oh, dear Jesus. The tail. Look at
                        the tail.

              They do. The tail is no longer weak and dying. It's snapping
              briskly back and forth, as if ready to play.

              Coffey makes that retching/gagging sound...and again exhales
              a cloud of swirling black "insects" from his nose and mouth.
              The men watch, speechless, as the bugs turn white and
              disappear.

              Coffey bends down, opens his hand. Mr. Jingles bounds off his
              fingers through the bars, racing past the guards' feet. They
              turn to see Del gather the mouse up, laughing and crying.
              Dean turns back to Coffey with a stunned whisper:

                                  DEAN
                        What did you do?

                                  COFFEY
                        I helped Del's mouse. He a circus
                        mouse. Goan live in a mouse city
                        down in...down in...

                                  BRUTAL
                               (numb)
                        Florida?

              Coffey nods, remembering.

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss Percy's bad. He mean. He step
                        on Del's mouse.
                               (softly)
                        I took it back, though.

              And with that, he lies back on his bunk and faces the wall.
              The others look to Paul, don't even know what to say.

                                  PAUL
                        Brute, come along with me.
                               (to Harry and Dean)
                        You fellas go on back to you
                        cribbage game.

              Harry nods numbly. Paul leads Brutal up the Mile...

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              ...and they enter to find Percy polishing Old Sparky's arms.

                                  PERCY
                        Don't start in on me. It was just
                        a mouse. Never belonged here in
                        the first place.

                                  PAUL
                        The mouse is fine. Just fine.
                        You're no better at mouse-killing
                        than anything else around here.

                                  PERCY
                        You expect me to believe that? I
                        heard the goddamn thing crunch.

              Paul steps closer, angry as we've ever seen him:

                                  PAUL
                        Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is
                        okay? After all our talks about
                        how we should keep the prisoners
                        calm? Aren't you relieved?

                                  PERCY
                        What kind of game is this?

                                  PAUL
                        No game. See for yourself.

              Beat. Percy stalks past them, heads out onto the Mile. Paul
              and Brutal just wait, saying nothing. Brutal picks up the rag
              left by Percy, resumes polishing chores on Old Sparky. Paul
              stretches, cracks his neck. The silence heavy...

              ...until Percy reappears.

                                  PERCY
                        You switched them! You switched
                        them somehow, you bastards!

                                  BRUTAL
                        I always keep a spare mouse in my
                        wallet for occasions such as this.

                                  PERCY
                        You're playing with me, the both
                        of you! Just who the hell do you
                        think you are--

              Brutal grabs him , slams him bodily into the electric chair.
              Paul bends close, gets right in Percy's face.

                                  PAUL
                        We're the people you work with,
                        Percy, but not for long. I want
                        your word.

                                  PERCY
                        My word?

                                  PAUL
                        I put you out front for Del, you
                        put in your transfer to Briar
                        Ridge the very next day.

                                  PERCY
                        What if I just call up certain
                        people and tell them you're
                        harassing me? Bullying me?

                                  PAUL
                        Go ahead. I promise you'll leave
                        your share of blood on the floor.

                                  PERCY
                        Over a mouse? You think anyone's
                        gonna give two shits?

                                  PAUL
                        No. But four men will swear you
                        stood by while Wild Bill tried to
                        strangle Dean to death. About that
                        people will care, Percy. Even your
                        uncle the governor will care.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Thing like that goes in your work
                        record. Work record can follow a
                        man around a long, long time.

              Percy looks from one man to another, knowing he's trapped.

                                  PAUL
                        I put you out front, you put in
                        your transfer. That's the deal.

              Percy thinks it over, nods. He tries to get up, but Paul keep
              him pinned...and pointedly offer his hand.

                                  PAUL
                        You make a promise to a man, you
                        shake his hand.

              Percy hesitates, shakes Paul's hand...

              HIGH WIDE ANGLE OF EXECUTION CHAMBER

              ...and Paul pulls him out of the electric chair as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - NEXT NIGHT

              Witnesses are trickling in, filling the seats. A storm is
              brewing, sending FLASHES OF LIGHTNING across the floors.

              INT. DEL'S CELL - NIGHT

              Del sits with Mr. Jingles in his lap, stroking the mouse
              between the ears. Paul, Brutal, and Harry appear at the bars.

                                  DEL
                        Hey, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles.

                                  PAUL
                        Eduard Delacroix, will you step
                        forward?

                                  DEL
                        Boss Edgecomb?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, Del?

                                  DEL
                        Don' let nothin' happen to Mr.
                        Jingles, okay?

              Paul nods--I promise. Del rises, steps to Paul.

                                  DEL
                        Here, take him.

              Del lifts his hand. Mr. Jingles steps off onto Paul's
              shoulder with no hesitation. Gently:

                                  PAUL
                        Del. I can't have a mouse on my
                        shoulder while...you know.

                                  COFFEY
                        I'll take him, boss. Jus' for now.
                        If Del don' mind.

                                  DEL
                        Yeah, you take 'im, John. Take him
                        til' dis foolishment done--bien!
                               (to Paul and Brutal)
                        After, you take him down to
                        Florida? To dat Mouseville?

                                  BRUTAL
                        We'll do it together, most likely.
                        Maybe take a little vacation time.

              Paul moves to Coffey's cell. The mouse skitters off Paul's
              shoulder onto Coffey's hand.

                                  DEL
                        People pay a dime apiece to see
                        him. Two cents for the kiddies.
                        Ain't dat right, Boss Howell?

                                  BRUTAL
                        That's right, Del.

                                  DEL
                        You a good man, Boss Howell. You
                        too, Boss Edgecomb. Wish I could'a
                        met you bot' someplace else.

              Del gives Mr. Jingles one last look, starts to cry.

                                  DEL
                        Au revoir, mon ami. Je t'aime, mon
                        petit.

              And they start to walk the Mile...

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Sweltering in the damp heat. Rain is pissing down, drumming
              the tin roof. People glance up uneasily as THUNDER BOOMS. A
              FAT LADY is staring grimly at the electric chair.

                                  FAT LADY
                        Hope he's good and scared. Hope he
                        knows the fires are stoked, and
                        that Satan's imps are waiting.

              ANGLE ON DOOR

              Del enters, horrified to see Percy waiting at Old Sparky.
              Paul gives Del's arm a reassuring squeeze, leads him
              forward...

              IN A TIGHT SERIES OF SHOTS:

              The clamps are applied. The straps are drawn tight.

                                  PERCY
                        Roll on one.

              The lights brighten on a RISING HUM. Witnesses look up.

              ON THE MILE

              Coffey looks up as the overheads flare hotter and hotter,
              whispers to the mouse in his hands:

                                  COFFEY
                        You be still, Mr. Jingles. You be
                        so quiet and so still.

              RESUME EXECUTION CHAMBER

                                  PERCY
                        Eduard Delacroix, you have been
                        condemned to die by a jury of your
                        peers, sentence imposed by a judge
                        in good standing in this state.
                        You have anything to say before
                        sentence is carried out?

              Del tries to speak. Doesn't quite manage the first time.
              Licks his lips and tries again.

                                  DEL
                        I sorry for what I do. I give
                        anything to take it back, but I
                        can't. God have mercy on me.
                               (whispers to Paul)
                        Don' forget 'bout Mouseville.

              Paul and Brutal nod--and are stunned as:

                                  PERCY
                        No such place. That's just a fairy
                        tale these guys told you to keep
                        you quiet. Just thought you should
                        know, faggot.

              The stricken look in Del's eyes tells us a part of him had
              known all along. Paul and Brutal would both like to deck
              Percy right about now, and he knows it--he gives them a "what
              are you gonna do about it" smile.

              Nothing they can do. Paul nods to Harry, who takes the black
              mask from the back of the chair and rolls it down over Del's
              head, leaving the top of his shaved head exposed.

              PERCY

              takes the sponge and bends down to the bucket of brine. The
              other don't see it, but we do:

              Percy only pretends to dip the sponge and soak it. It never
              touches the water. He straightens up and places the sponge
              atop Delacroix's head, hiding it with his hands.

              The cap is lowered. Paul and the others haven't yet realized
              what's happened. THUNDER BOOMS and LIGHTNING CRASHES as Percy
              hides a smile, steps back to address the condemned:

                                  PERCY
                        Electricity shall now be passed
                        through your body until you are
                        dead, in accordance with state
                        law. God have mercy on your soul.

              TIGHT ON PAUL

              as realization starts to dawn. He stares at the bucket, then
              across the floor to Delacroix, coming to terms with the
              evidence of his eyes--there's no water on the floor or
              dripping down the sides of Del's neck.

              Paul's eyes widen. A stunned beat of horror. He starts to
              open his mouth to scream "NO!", but Percy beats him to it
              with:

                                  PERCY
                        Roll on two.

              Van Hay flicks the switch. WHAM. The electricity hits home
              and Del rocks forward, riding the current.

              Then things start to go horribly wrong.

              The HUMMING loses its steadiness and starts to waver with a
              CRACKLING SOUND. Tendrils of smoke begin curling from under
              the cap, a mixture of burning hair and sponge. Brutal shoots
              Paul a horrified look. Paul responds with a harsh whisper:

                                  PAUL
                        It's dry!

              Delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair, his
              masked face snapping violently from side to side, his legs
              pistoning up and down in his restraints.

              There's a MUFFLED POP from under the cap, like a pine knot
              exploding in a hot fire. Smoke starts coming through the
              fabric of the mask, puffing upward. Del is being cooked
              alive. Paul spins to the partition, hollering--

                                  PAUL
                        JACK!

              --but Brutal grabs his arm, whispers fiercely:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Don't you tell him to stop. Don't
                        you do it. It's too late for that.

              Paul turns back, helpless. The other guards are trading wild
              looks, unable to believe what's happening. Even Percy looks
              aghast--he was expecting something, but not this.

              Del begins SCREAMING--the wild, hysterical sound of an animal
              being shredded alive in a hay baler. The HUMMING goes uneven
              and ragged, the lights rising and falling...

              ON THE MILE

              ...as Del's screams rise and fall with them, echoing up the
              corridor. Coffey's shaking and screaming too, as if feeling
              Del's pain. Mr. Jingles squirms out of his grasp and goes
              squeaking in terror toward the restraint room door...

                                  BILLY
                        HE'S COOKIN' NOW! THEY COOKIN' HIM
                        GOOD! NEAR ABOUT DONE, I RECKON!

              RESUME EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Wrong. Del's nowhere near about done. He's slamming back and
              forth in the chair hard enough to shake the platform,
              twisting hard against the leather restraints. We hear BONES
              BREAKING. A WOMAN'S SCREAMS. Witnesses start rising to their
              feet:

                                  WITNESSES
                        What the hell's happening to
                        him?...Are those clamps going to
                        hold?...Christ, the smell!...Is
                        this normal?

              The mask bursts into flame on Delacroix's face. Van Hay
              hollers through the wire mesh, horrified:

                                  VAN HAY
                        SHOULD I KILL THE JUICE?

                                  PAUL
                        NO! ROLL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ROLL!

              Harry scoops up the bucket of water to throw it.

                                  PAUL
                        No water! No water! You crazy?

              Harry backs off with a look of dazed understanding--you don't
              throw water on a man getting juiced. Right. He drops the
              bucket, races to get the chemical fire extinguisher instead.

              The flaming mask peels away, revealing Del's charring face.
              His eyeballs are misshapen globs of burning white jelly blown
              out of their sockets. The ATTENDING DOCTOR faints dead away.

              Pandemonium now in the room. People shouting and hurrying to
              exit, chairs falling over, women screaming:

                                  FAT LADY
                        Stop it, stop it, oh can't you see
                        he's had enough?

              Hal grabs Paul by the shoulder, spins him around.

                                  HAL
                        Why don't you shut it down?

                                  PAUL
                        He's still alive! You want me to
                        shut down while he's still alive?

              Hal is horrified at the thought. Del is jittering and
              screaming, rocking from side to side, smoke pouring from his
              nostrils and mouth, his tongue sizzling purple-black.

              The witnesses are crowding and shoving to get out, but the
              back door is locked. All they can do is cluster there.

              Paul sees Percy with his head turned away. He grabs him,
              forces his head around.

                                  PAUL
                        You watch, you son of a bitch!

              Harry steps up, the extinguisher in his hands. Waiting. Del
              finally slumps over. He still vibrating, but now it's just
              the effect of current flowing through his body.

                                  PAUL
                        Kill it!

              Van Hay kills the current. The HUMMING DIES. Brutal grabs the
              extinguisher from Harry, shoves it into Percy's hands.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You do it. You're running the
                        show, ain't you?

              Percy, sick and dazed, aims the extinguisher and hoses the
              smoking corpse. Hal is near the back, calming the crowd:

                                  HAL
                        It's all right, folks, it's all
                        under control. Just a power surge
                        from the storm, that's all,
                        nothing to worry about...

                                  PAUL
                        Dean, get doc's stethoscope.

              Dean drops to the doctor's bag, digs through it, hands up the
              stethoscope. Paul plugs them into his ears. People are
              moaning and sobbing at the back of the room:

                                  MAN
                        Oh my God! Is it always like this?
                        Why didn't somebody tell me? I
                        never would have come!

              Paul wipes some foam away from Delacroix's chest, places the
              stethoscope pad to the raw flesh. He nods to Brutal--it's
              over.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              Paul and the others bring the stretcher down, lay the corpse
              on the gurney. Percy starts stammering excuses:

                                  PERCY
                        I didn't know the sponge was
                        supposed to be wet--

              Brutal hauls off and slugs him. A scuffle ensues as the
              others grab Brutal and pull him off.

                                  PAUL
                        Brutal, no!

                                  BRUTAL
                        What do you mean, no? How can you
                        say no? You saw what he did!

                                  PAUL
                        Delacroix's dead, nothing can
                        change that, and Percy's not worth
                        it!

                                  BRUTAL
                        So he just gets away with it? Is
                        that how it works?

              Hal comes lunging down the stairs, furious:

                                  HAL
                        What the fuck was that? Jesus
                        Christ, three witnesses puked all
                        over the floor up there! And the
                        smell! I got Van Hay to open both
                        doors, but that smell won't come
                        out for five damn years, that's
                        what I'm betting! And that asshole
                        Wharton is singing about it! I can
                        hear him!

                                  PAUL
                               (quietly)
                        Can he carry a tune, Hal?

              This pulls the plug on the moment--Hal snorts, triggering
              laughter among the men, a wild release of tension and fear.
              Everybody starts feeling a bit saner again as it dies down:

                                  HAL
                        Okay, boys. Okay. Now what the
                        hell happened?

              All eyes go to Percy. Hal turns, sees Percy's bloody lip.

                                  HAL
                        Percy? Something to say?

                                  PERCY
                        I didn't know the sponge was
                        supposed to be wet.

              Beat. A look of utter contempt from Hal.

                                  HAL
                        How many years you spend pissing
                        on the toilet seat before somebody
                        told you to put it up?

                                  PAUL
                        Percy fucked up, Hal. Pure and
                        simple.

                                  HAL
                        Is that your official position?

                                  PAUL
                        Don't you think it should be?

              Hal considers it, nods.

                                  PAUL
                        He'll be putting in a transfer
                        request to Briar Ridge tomorrow.
                        Moving on to bigger and better
                        things. Isn't that right, Percy?

              Percy nods. Hal steps close, gives him a tight, icy smile.

                                  HAL
                        You're a little asshole, and I
                        don't like you a bit.
                               (off Percy's look)
                        Have that transfer request on my
                        desk first thing.

              Hal heads back up the stairs. Brutal shoves Percy aside and
              wheels Delacroix's body down the tunnel.

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Paul returns to find Wild Bill making up a song in his cell:

                                  BILLY
                               (singing)
                        Barbecue! Me and you! Stinky,
                        pinky, phew-phew-phew! Weren't
                        Billy or Jilly or Hilly or Roy--it
                        was a French-fried faggot named
                        Delacroix!

                                  PAUL
                        You're about ten seconds away from
                        spending the rest of your life in
                        the padded room.

              Billy falls silent. Paul continues down the Mile to Coffey's
              cell. Coffey's on his bunk, face streaked with tears. He
              wipes his eyes with the heels of his hands like an exhausted
              child.

                                  COFFEY
                        Poor Del. Poor old Del.

                                  PAUL
                        Yes. Poor old Del. John, are you
                        okay?

                                  COFFEY
                        I could feel it from here.

                                  PAUL
                        What do you mean? You could hear
                        it? Is that what you mean?

                                  COFFEY
                        He's out of it now, though. He's
                        the lucky one. No matter how it
                        happened, Del's the lucky one.

              Paul realizes he won't get a coherent answer.

                                  PAUL
                        Where's Mr. Jingles?

                                  COFFEY
                               (points vaguely)
                        Ran down there. Don't think he'll
                        be back.
                               (beat)
                        Awful tired now, boss. Dog tired.

              Coffey lays down, turns to face the wall.

                                  PAUL
                        Me too, John. Me too.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul enters in darkness, hangs his hat. He drifts into the
              kitchen, clicks on the radio. SOFT MUSIC BEGINS: Gene Austin
              singing "Did You Ever See A Dream Walking?"

              He pours a drink at the kitchen table, takes a sip, lays the
              glass down. Jan sleepily appears from the darkness behind
              him, entering the kitchen. He realizes she's there, glances
              back.

              She can sense the weight on his soul. She comes to him, folds
              his head into her arms. They stand that way, he drawing
              strength and she giving it, as the music plays on...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              SEQUENCE WITH MUSIC:

              INT. CHURCH - MORNING

              CAMERA TRACKS the pews to find Paul and Jan seated together
              in the congregation, voices raised in hymn...

              EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING

              Paul's Model T comes sputtering up the road. He and Jan are
              taking a drive, still in their Sunday best...

              EXT. HAL'S HOUSE - MORNING

              Paul and Jan wait at the front door. Jan holds a baking dish.

                                  PAUL
                        I hate this.

                                  JAN
                        I know.

              The door opens. Hal, looking tired, ushers them inside...

              EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING

              ...and they walk outside to find MELINDA MOORES sitting in
              the sun, frail and wasted, a blanket on her knees. She'd be
              beautiful if not for the cancer killing her.

              Paul is shocked at her appearance, hides it as best as he
              can. Jan covers this for him--she drops to Melinda's side
              with a warm smile and a kiss, takes the woman's frail hands
              in hers.

              Paul catches Jan's eye. The look he gives her says it all--I
              don't know what I'd do without you...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and we find Paul and Hal talking quietly over beers while
              the women visit b.g.:

                                  HAL
                        She's having one of her good days.
                        I thank God for that.

                                  PAUL
                        What a bad day?

                                  HAL
                               (beat)
                        Sometimes she's...not herself
                        anymore. She swears.

                                  PAUL
                        Swears.

                                  HAL
                        It just pops out, the most awful
                        language you can imagine. She
                        doesn't even know she's doing it.
                        I didn't know she'd ever heard
                        words like that...and to hear her
                        say them in her sweet voice...
                               (gazes off)
                        I'm glad she's having a good day,
                        Paul. I'm glad for you and Jan.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

              Paul is wide awake, staring at the dark. Jan can sense him
              brooding. She rolls over sleepily.

                                  JAN
                        Honey? If you don't say what's on
                        your mind, I'm afraid I'll have to
                        smother you with a pillow.

                                  PAUL
                        I'm thinking I love you. I'm
                        thinking I don't know what I'd do
                        if you were gone.

                                  JAN
                        Oh.

                                  PAUL
                               (beat)
                        I'm also thinking I'd like to have
                        the boys over tomorrow.

              Off Jan's look, we

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. DINING ROOM- DAY

              Brutal, Harry, and Dean are seated at the table with Paul and
              Jan. Serving plates are being passes, everybody digging in:

                                  THE MEN
                               (various, ad-lib)
                        Ma'am, you sure know how to fry up
                        some fine chicken...Brutal, don't
                        hog the taters now...Try that corn
                        yet? It's something special...

              Paul softly interjects:

                                  PAUL
                        You saw what he did with the mouse.

              This stops everybody cold. Dean puts his chicken down, wipes
              his hands. Looks are traded in the silence.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I could'a gone the rest of the day
                        without you bringing that up.

                                  DEAN
                        I could'a gone the rest of the
                        year.

                                  PAUL
                        He did it to me too. He put his
                        hands on me and took my bladder
                        infection away.

              The men absorb this. Brutal glances to Jan.

                                  JAN
                        When he came home, he was...all
                        better.

                                  DEAN
                        You're talking about an authentic
                        healing. A praise-Jesus miracle.

                                  PAUL
                        I am.

                                  BRUTAL
                        If you say it, I accept it. But
                        what's it got to do with us?

              Jan looks to Paul, realization starting to dawn:

                                  JAN
                        Melinda? Oh, Paul...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Melinda? Melinda Moores?

              Paul nods--that's who we're talking about.

                                  JAN
                        You really think you can help her?

                                  PAUL
                        It's not a bladder infection, or
                        even a busted-up mouse. But there
                        might be a chance.

                                  HARRY
                        Hold on now. You're talking about
                        our jobs. Sneak a sick woman onto
                        a cellblock?

                                  PAUL
                        Hal would never allow that. You
                        know him, he wouldn't believe
                        something unless it fell on him.

                                  BRUTAL
                        So you're talking about taking
                        John Coffey to her. That's more
                        than just our jobs, Paul.

                                  DEAN
                        Damn right. That's prison time if
                        we get caught.

                                  HARRY
                        Let's not discuss this like it's
                        even an option. Brutal, help me
                        out here...

              Brutal lets out a deep breath, considering. He looks to Paul.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I'm sure she's a fine woman...

                                  JAN
                        The finest.

                                  PAUL
                        What's happening to her is an
                        offense, Brutal. To the eyes and
                        the ears and the heart.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I have no doubt. But we don't know
                        her like you and Jan do...do we?

                                  PAUL
                        That's why it's a lot to ask.

                                  HARRY
                        It is. Let's not forget Coffey's
                        a murderer. What if he escapes?
                        I'd hate losing my job or going to
                        prison, but I'd hate having a dead
                        child on my conscience even more.

                                  PAUL
                        I don't think that'll happen...
                               (beat, softly)
                        ...in fact, I don't think he did
                        it at all.

              The men are stunned by this. Off their looks:

                                  PAUL
                        I just can't see God putting a
                        gift like that in the hands of a
                        man who would kill a child.

                                  DEAN
                        Well, that's a tender notion, but
                        the man's on death row for the
                        crime. Plus, he's huge. If he
                        tried to get away, it'd take a lot
                        of bullets to stop him.

                                  BRUTAL
                        We'd all have shotguns in addition
                        to sidearms. I'd insist on that.
                               (to Paul)
                        He tried anything, we'd have to
                        take him down. You understand.

                                  PAUL
                        I understand.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (beat)
                        So. Tell us what you had in mind.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                    "Night Journey"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. INFIRMARY BUILDING/DISPENSARY - NIGHT

              A FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays across a glass cabinet, scanning the
              contents. The beam pauses. A hand enters frame, unlocks the
              cabinet, pulls out a bottle of morphine tablets...

              ...and WE ANGLE TO Brutal as he shakes half a dozen pills
              onto his palm, pockets them, replaces the bottle on the
              shelf. He turns and slips five bucks to a NIGHTSHIFT ORDERLY.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I was never here.

                                  ORDERLY
                        Shit, for five bucks, you was
                        never nowhere.

              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              A MORPHINE PILL is being crushed to powder on the stainless
              steel gurney. TILT UP to Paul crushing the pills. Brutal
              carefully scrapes the powder onto a small sheet of paper...

              INT. PAUL'S INNER OFFICE - NIGHT

              Percy is parked in Paul's chair with his feet up, reading a
              book titled: "CARING FOR MENTAL PATIENTS."

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Harry and Dean are playing cards at the duty desk, tension
              thick, cards slapping softly as the seconds tick by. Paul and
              Brutal finally show up toting bottles of RC cola:

                                  BRUTAL
                        Fellas thirsty? Fresh out of the
                        icebox.

                                  DEAN
                        Oh, thanks. That's swell.

                                  HARRY
                        Yeah, hot in here.

              They begin popping the caps off, swigging cola. The sound of
              it brings Billy to his bars.

                                  BILLY
                        Hey. Hey, I'm'a get some too.

                                  BRUTAL
                        My ass you get some too.

                                  PAUL
                        You think you deserve any?

                                  HARRY
                               (checks a clipboard)
                        Day report says he's been okay.

                                  BILLY
                        Hell, yes, I been behaved. C'mon,
                        now, don't be stingy hogs.

              Paul shrugs to Brutal--why not? Brutal pops the top off a
              bottle, passes it to Paul. Paul grabs a tin cup, sets it on
              the desk...and we see it contains the morphine powder. He
              pours the cola, swirls it around...

              ANGLE THROUGH COFFEY'S BARS

              ...as Coffey looks up, sensing something happening. He peers
              up the Mile as Paul walks to:

              BILLY'S CELL

              Billy reaches for the cup, but Paul keeps it out of reach.

                                  PAUL
                        You gonna stay behaved?

                                  BILLY
                        C'mon, you clunk, gimme that.

                                  PAUL
                        You promise me, or I'll drink it
                        myself right here in front of you.

                                  BILLY
                        C'mon now, don't be that way. I be
                        good.

              Paul lets him take the cup. Billy knocks it back, draining it
              in three huge swallows. He lets out an awesome belch.

                                  PAUL
                        Cup.

                                  BILLY
                        We'll break out the fire hose and
                        take it anyway. And you will have
                        drunk your last R.C. cola. Unless
                        they serve 'em down in hell.

              Billy's smile fades. He hands the cup through the bars. Paul
              takes it, turns and heads back to--

              THE DUTY DESK

              --where Brutal, Harry, and Dean have been watching the entire
              exchange with their hearts in their throats...

                                                       DISSOLVE:

              ...and we find Billy staring glassy-eyed at the ceiling. He
              keels over on his bunk. ANGLE to Paul and Brutal stepping to
              the bars with Harry and Dean.

                                  PAUL
                        Anybody wants to back out, now's
                        the time. After this, there's no
                        turning back.
                               (off their looks)
                        So? We gonna do this?

              A voice comes softly from down the way:

                                  COFFEY
                        Sure. I'd like to take a ride.

              Their heads come slowly around, staring at Coffey in shock.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (to Paul)
                        Guess were all in.

              INT. PAUL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

              Percy looks up from his book as the door opens. Paul enters
              with Brutal and Harry, ominously hemming the desk.

                                  PERCY
                        What is this?

              Paul pulls the canvas straitjacket from behind his back.

                                  PAUL
                        Payback.

              Percy jumps up and tries to the execution chamber, but Harry
              grabs him, spins him back. A wild scuffle ensues as:

                                  PERCY
                        Let go of me! Let go!

                                  PAUL
                        Settle down, Percy!

              Percy tries to jerk away, crashes into the desk. The book he
              was reading falls to the floor--

              --and a "Tijuana Bible" is revealed within the pages. It's a
              pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the '30's,
              featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or
              movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts. This one has
              Olive Oyl getting it doggy-style from Popeye. The word
              balloon over his head features his famous laugh: "Uk-uk-uk-
              uk!"

                                  BRUTAL
                        Oooo, Poicy! What would your
                        mother say?

                                  PERCY
                        Let go, you ignoramus! I know
                        people! Big people!

                                  PAUL
                        So you've said. C'mon, stick out
                        your arms like a good boy.

                                  PERCY
                        I won't. And you can't make me.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You're dead wrong about that, you
                        know.

              Brutal grabs Percy by the ears, twisting hard. Percy lets out
              a shriek--not just of pain, but a dismayed understanding that
              he's not going to bluster his way out of this one.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You gonna put your arms up? I'll
                        rip your ears off. Use 'em for tea
                        caddies. You know I will.

                                  PAUL
                        The man's ripping your ears off,
                        Percy. I'd do as he says.

              Percy jerks his arms up before him. They get the straitjacket
              on him within seconds. Percy turns to Paul on the verge of
              tears. Softly:

                                  PERCY
                        Please, Paul. Don't put me in with
                        Wild Bill. Please.

                                  PAUL
                        You would think that.

              Paul gives him a hard, angry shove...

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              ...and they bring him down the Mile to the restraint room
              door. Brutal takes Percy's holster and baton.

                                  BRUTAL
                        You'll get 'em back, don't worry.

                                  PERCY
                        That's more than I can say about
                        your jobs. All your jobs! You
                        can't do this to me! You can't!

              Paul steps forward with a roll of strapping tape.

                                  PAUL
                        Let you in on a little secret. We
                        can and we are.

              He slaps the tape over Percy's mouth and shoves him back into
              the restraint room. Percy stands breathing heavily through
              his nose, making muffled mmmmph-mmmph! sounds under the tape.

                                  PAUL
                        You're going to have a few hours
                        of quiet time now, so you can
                        reflect on what you did to Del.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (grins)
                        If you get lonely, think about
                        Olive Oyl...
                               (thrusting his hips)
                        ...uk-uk-uk-uk!

              And they slam the door, shutting Percy into darkness.

              A WALL-MOUNTED GUN SAFE

              is unlocked, shotguns pulled out. The men load up, heading
              down the Mile as:

                                  PAUL
                        One more time--what do you say if
                        somebody comes by?

                                  DEAN
                        Coffey got upset, so we put him in
                        the restraint room. They hear any
                        noise, they'll think it's him.

              They come to Coffey's cell.

                                  COFFEY
                        We goan for the ride now?

                                  PAUL
                        That's right.

              The cell is unlocked. Coffey emerges. Paul motions them
              along, still grilling Dean:

                                  PAUL
                        What about us?

                                  DEAN
                        You're over in Admin, going over
                        Del's file. Brutal and Harry are
                        in the laundry doing their wash--

              A skinny white arm suddenly shoots out from Wild Bill's cell
              and grabs Coffey by the wrist. The men gasp, shocked to see
              Billy on his feet, grinning and weaving like a punch-drunk.

              Coffey's reaction is beyond simple surprise; he's actually
              trembling at Billy's touch as if some electrical circuit were
              engaged. His eyes are wide and horrified, as if he'd just put
              his hand in a basket full of snakes. He tries to pull away,
              but Billy has him tight, that mysterious circuit blazing.

                                  BILLY
                               (slurring wildly)
                        Where you fink you're goin'?

              Coffey responds softly, with utmost horror:

                                  COFFEY
                        You're a bad man.

                                  BILLY
                        S'right, nigger. Bad as you'd want.

              Paul plucks Billy's hand off Coffey's arm--and Coffey
              flinches back as the circuit is broken.

                                  BILLY
                        Whooeee. Whole room's spinning.
                        Like I'm shit-ass drunk. I have me
                        some shine or what?

              He turns and staggers back to his bunk, muttering all the way:

                                  BILLY
                        Niggers oughtta have they own
                        'lectric chair. White man oughtn't
                        havta sit in no nigger 'lectric
                        chair, nossir...

              He goes face-first onto his bunk. Coffey is still staring.

                                  COFFEY
                        He's a bad man.

              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

              Coffey is brought in...and freezes in horror at the sight of
              Old Sparky. A whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        They're still in there. Pieces of
                        them, still in there. I hear them
                        screaming.

              All eyes go to the electric chair. It sits shrouded in shadow
              like an ominous throne. Never before has this place felt so
              haunted to the men. It makes the hairs on the neck stand up.

                                  PAUL
                        John, come along! Right now,
                        y'hear? C'mon! Toward that door!

              Coffey finally responds, pulling away...

              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              ...and they come down the steps. They realize Coffey will
              have to stoop all the way down the tunnel. Paul pats the
              gurney.

                                  PAUL
                        Lie down on this.
                               (off Coffey's look)
                        It'll be easier for you and no
                        harder for us.

              Coffey eases carefully onto the gurney, lying on his back.
              His knees hang over the edge and his toes touch the ground,
              but it works. They push him along, traversing the pools of
              light.

              Coffey actually starts to smile. He reaches out his arms,
              fingertips touching the tunnel walls as they go by.

                                  COFFEY
                        Say. This is fun.

              EXT. PRISON WALL - NIGHT

              A massive iron door SQUEALS open onto a little-used fenced
              enclosure. Paul and the others bring Coffey up from the
              tunnel below, emerging into the night. Coffey's breath
              catches as he gazes wondrously up at the stars, pointing:

                                  COFFEY
                        Look, boss! It's Cassie, the lady
                        in the rocking chair!

                                  PAUL
                        Shhh. John, you have to be quiet
                        now.

                                  COFFEY
                               (whispering)
                        You see her? You see the lady?

                                  BRUTAL
                        We see her, John.

              Harry goes first, hugging the shadows as he pulls his keys to
              unlock the gate...

              WIDE SHOT OF PRISON

              ...while TOWER GUARDS huddle in their enclosure atop the
              walls. An occasional SPOTLIGHT cuts the darkness. FIREFLIES
              dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see.

              Four dark figures detach from the shadows, hurrying across
              the lonely country road into the fields on the far side...

              EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

              Coffey's hand scoops up some fallen leaves. TILT UP to his
              face as he crunches them under his nose, inhaling their smell.

              He see the guards throwing him anxious looks. He misreads
              this, holds out his hand so they can smell too. They do it,
              just to make him happy.

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, big boy, keep moving.

              A FEW FIREFLIES come winking through frame as the group
              presses on...

              ANOTHER AREA/WOODS

              The trees are growing sparser, opening onto fields. MORE
              FIREFLIES are flitting into view, trailing in their wake...

                                  BRUTAL
                        How far is it?

                                  HARRY
                        Just up ahead...

              Harry brings them to a thicket of trees. They start removing
              branches and boughs, uncovering a battered old FARMALL TRUCK
              hidden in the brush.

              The men pause. Even more fireflies are swirling around them,
              growing in number. It's getting downright weird.

              Coffey laughs softly, drawing their attention. A childlike
              smile has utterly transformed his face. He raises his hand,
              letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers.

                                  COFFEY
                        Hey there, little firefly. Where's
                        Mrs. Firefly this evening?

              Another firefly joins the first, both now dancing and
              blinking around his fingers. Coffey laughs again.

                                  COFFEY
                        Oh, there you is. You come out to
                        play too?

              The men stand gaping. The fireflies are flitting to Coffey as
              if to a beacon. He waves his hands slowly, fireflies blinking
              and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust.

              They begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing
              planet orbiting a sun, their light kicking a mellow sheen off
              his ebony skin. Coffey's eyes meet Paul's.

                                  PAUL
                        They seem...drawn to you.

                                  COFFEY
                        I love 'em, is why. They don't
                        think no hurtful thoughts. They's
                        just happy to be. Happy little
                        lightning bugs...

              The men don't know whether to be enchanted or terrified.
              Harry gives Paul a look--can we go? Please?

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy.

              Coffey clambers up on the stakebed. Paul and Brutal join him.
              Harry gets in behind the wheel, jabs the starter button...

              ON THE STAKEBED

              ...while Coffey sits with his back to the cab.

                                  PAUL
                        John? Do you know where we're
                        taking you?

                                  COFFEY
                        Help a lady?

                                  PAUL
                        That's right. Help a lady. But how
                        did you know?

                                  COFFEY
                        Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I
                        don't know much'a anything. Never
                        have.

              The truck pulls out. Coffey waves as the fireflies get left
              behind, dwindling away like stars.

                                  COFFEY
                        Bye, fireflies. Bye.

              WIDE ANGLE OF COUNTRYSIDE

              The truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road, countless
              fireflies swirling in its wake...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              EXT. MOORES HOUSE - NIGHT

              Headlights come over the rise. The truck appears, rumbling
              down toward the house. The world is isolated and still.

              IN THE TRUCK CAB

              Harry stops and cuts the engine, leaving the headlights on.
              Silence now, save for the trilling of crickets.

              IN THE STAKEBED

              Paul and Brutal both look terrified now that they're actually
              here. An urgent whisper:

                                  BRUTAL
                        We can still turn back.

              Paul hesitates, wanting to do just that, but:

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss, look. Someone's up.

              Lights are coming on inside the house. Coffey rises and steps
              down from the truck, pulling Paul along. Brutal follows them.

                                  BRUTAL
                        This is a mistake. Christ, Paul,
                        what were we thinking?

                                  PAUL
                        Too late now. Harry, keep John
                        here until we call you.

              Paul and Brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside
              the house keep clicking on. The last one finally comes on
              over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin
              barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night.

                                  HAL
                        Who the hell goes there at two-
                        thirty in the goddamn morning?

                                  PAUL
                        Hal, it's us! It's Paul and
                        Brutal--it's us!

              The door swings wider, revealing Hal's face gaunt and haggard
              in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them:

                                  HAL
                        Paul, what are you doing here at
                        this hour? Jesus, it's not a
                        lockdown, is it? Or a riot?

                                  PAUL
                        Hal, God's sakes, take your finger
                        off the trigger...

              Hal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard.

                                  HAL
                        Are you hostages? Who's out there?
                        Who's by that truck?

              Coffey steps into the glare of headlights with Harry tugging
              on his arm, trying to hold him back. Hal cocks both hammers.

                                  HAL
                        John Coffey! Halt! Halt right
                        there or I shoot!

              His aim wavers as a woman's voice comes from upstairs:

                                  MELINDA (O.S.)
                        Hal? Who are you talking to, you
                        fucking cocksucker?

              A frozen moment. Hal mortified. Paul gives him a look--is
              that Melinda?

              Hal's shotgun shifts back to Coffey--but Paul steps in front
              of the muzzle.

                                  PAUL
                        No one's hurt. We're here to help.

                                  HAL
                        Help what? I don't understand. Is
                        this a prison break?

                                  PAUL
                        I can't explain what it is. You
                        just have to trust me.

              Coffey comes up the steps, brushes Paul aside, stops before
              the warden. Hal blinks, his thoughts suddenly fuzzy--it's
              that benign hypnotic effect Coffey has.

                                  HAL
                        What do you...want?

                                  MELINDA
                        Hal! Make them go away! No
                        salesmen in the middle of the
                        night! No Fuller brushes! No
                        French knickers with come in the
                        crotch! Tell them to take a flying
                        fuck in a rolling d...d...

              We hear the sound of GLASS BREAKING, then she begins to sob.

                                  COFFEY
                               (a whisper)
                        Just to help. Just to help, boss,
                        that's all.

                                  HAL
                        You can't. No one can.

              Coffey pulls the shotgun gently from Hal's grasp, hands it to
              Paul. Coffey moves past Hal into the house...

              INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

              ...and comes up the hallway toward the stairs.

                                  HAL
                        Don't you go up there! Don't you
                        do it!

                                  COFFEY
                        Boss, you just be quiet now and
                        let me be.

              Coffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels,
              heading up toward that quavering voice:

                                  MELINDA (O.S.)
                        Stay out of here! Whoever you are,
                        just stay out! I'm not dressed for
                        visitors, you rat's asshole!

              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

              Coffey enters, trailed by the others. Paul pauses, horrified.

              The woman propped in bed barely resembles Melinda Moores
              anymore--she looks made up like a Halloween witch, her livid
              skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles, one corner of her
              mouth twisted. Yellowish bile stains her chin and the front
              of her nightgown. Her hair has gone white and straw-like, her
              eyes glowering at Coffey with lively, irrational interest:

                                  MELINDA
                        Oh, so big! Pull down your pants!
                        Let's have a look!

              Hal groans with despair. Coffey just stands there for a
              moment, watching her from a distance, then approaches the
              bed...

                                  MELINDA
                        Don't come near me, pigfucker.

              ...but as he draws closer, a change occurs. Her features
              soften, her eyes become more sane and aware.

                                  MELINDA
                        Why do you have so many scars? Who
                        hurt you so badly?

                                  COFFEY
                        Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

              Coffey sits on the edge of the bed. The lights seem to flare
              hotter and brighter. Tears are forming in Melinda's eyes.

                                  MELINDA
                        What's your name?

                                  COFFEY
                        John Coffey, ma'am. Like the
                        drink, only not spelt the same.

              She lays back, staring at him with shining fascination. The
              world seems to be slowing down, growing very still indeed...

              ...and he starts bending slowly toward her.

                                  COFFEY
                        Ma'am?

                                  MELINDA
                        Yes, John Coffey?

                                  COFFEY
                        I see it. I see it.

              He comes closer...closer still...

                                  COFFEY
                        You be still now. You be so quiet
                        and so still.

              He brushes her forehead with his lips...the gentlest whisper
              of a kiss...then moves his mouth down to hers. For a moment
              we can see one of her eyes staring past him, filling with an
              expression of surprise...

              ...and then her face is lost to view as Coffey puts his lips
              on hers. We hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling
              the air deeply from her lungs. Something hot and glowing
              starts passing between them, drawn on his breath...

              The men watch. The house seems to shudder in that moment, as
              if the entire world has shifted an inch to the right...

              DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR

              ...and the grandfather clock stops ticking, the pendulum
              stopping dead, the glass face cracking neatly up the center...

              BEDROOM

              ...and a windowpane cracks. Then another. A picture falls off
              the wall. A lightbulb bursts, showering glass.

              Paul smells smoke, realizes the fringed coverlet of the bed
              has caught fire. Moving like a man in a dream, he reaches for
              the waterglass on the nightstand, douses the flames.

              Coffey keeps kissing Melinda in that deep and mysterious way,
              inhaling and inhaling, her hand held in his like a tiny white
              bird. For a moment we actually hear something screaming, as
              if some willful imp were being extracted by force...

              ...and then it's over. Coffey raises his head, revealing:

              Melinda's beautiful face. Her mouth no longer droops. Color
              is coming back to her hair. Her skin is shining with life.

              Coffey regards her raptly for a moment or two, then starts
              coughing violently.

              He turns away and drops to his knees, hacking like a man in
              the last stages of tuberculosis.

              Paul and his men are expecting Coffey to spit out the "bugs",
              but he doesn't--he just keeps coughing, deep and hard, barely
              finding time to snatch in the next breath of air.

              Hal goes to his wife, beyond stunned, sits at her side. She
              looks back at him with amazement, her face like a dirty
              mirror that's been suddenly wiped clean.

              John's coughing grows even worse. Brutal drops to his side
              and slaps his broad, spasming back.

                                  BRUTAL
                        John! Sick it up! Cough 'em out
                        like you done before!

              Coffey just keeps retching, eyes watering from the strain,
              spit flying from his mouth.

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's choking! Whatever he sucked
                        out of her, he's choking on it!

              Paul starts toward them. Coffey crawls away, pressing himself
              into a corner with his face against the wallpaper. He's still
              making gruesome deep hacking sounds, but getting it under
              control. He weakly waves Paul off--let me be.

              Paul looks to the bed. Hal sits with Melinda, stroking her
              brow. Color is blooming in her cheeks even as we watch.

                                  MELINDA
                        How did I get here? We were going
                        to the hospital in Indianola,
                        weren't we? We stopped and you
                        bought me a packet of posies...

                                  HAL
                        Shhh. It doesn't matter. It
                        doesn't matter anymore.

                                  MELINDA
                        Did I have the X-ray? Did I

                                  PAUL
                        Yes.

              They both look at him.

                                  PAUL
                        It was clear. There was no tumor.

              Hal bursts into tears. Melinda sits up, comforting him. Her
              eyes are drawn to the corner.

                                  MELINDA
                        Who is that man?

              Coffey is struggling to rise. Brutal does his best to help.

                                  PAUL
                        John? Can you turn around? Can you
                        turn around and see this lady?

              Coffey turns. His face is ashen gray, seriously ill.

                                  MELINDA
                        What's your name?

                                  COFFEY
                        John Coffey, ma'am.

                                  MELINDA
                        Like the drink, only not spelled
                        the same.

                                  COFFEY
                        No, ma'am. Not spelt the same at
                        all.

              She pushes the covers aside to rise. Hal tries to stop her...

                                  HAL
                        Melly, no...

              ...but she pushes his hand gently aside. Hal watches in
              wonder as she stands, takes a first tentative step...and
              walks to Coffey. She gazes up and touches his face.

                                  MELINDA
                        I dreamed of you. I dreamed you
                        were wandering in the dark, and so
                        was I. We found each other. We
                        found each other in the dark.

              She undoes her necklace, holds it up for him. He hesitates,
              glances to Paul. Paul nods--it's all right. Coffey lowers his
              head. Melinda affixes the delicate chain around his neck.

                                  MELINDA
                        It's St. Christopher. I want you
                        to have it, Mr. Coffey, and wear
                        it. He'll keep you safe. Please
                        wear it for me.

                                  COFFEY
                        Thank you, ma'am.

                                  MELINDA
                        Thank you, John.

              Her arms go around his neck, hugging him tightly as if she
              might never let go.

              EXT. MOORES HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul and the men hustle Coffey out the front door toward the
              truck, helping him as best they can. He's weak as a baby,
              knees threatening to give out at any moment.

                                  PAUL
                        C'mon, John, stay on your feet.

                                  HARRY
                        Christ, he goes down, we'll need
                        three mules and a crane to pick
                        him up again...

              They get Coffey to the truck and throw their backs into it,
              helping him crawl up onto the stakebed. He rolls over on his
              back. Harry hops up, covers him with an old blanket. Brutal
              pulls aside, speaking low:

                                  BRUTAL
                        He'll never sit in Old Sparky. You
                        know that, don't you?
                               (off Paul's look)
                        He swallowed that stuff for a
                        reason. I give him a few days. One
                        of us'll be doing a cell check and
                        there he'll be. Dead on his bunk.

                                  PAUL
                        If that's his choice, he's earned
                        it.
                               (beat)
                        Let's get him back on the Mile.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:

                                  "Coffey on the Mile"

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Dean starts babbling with relief as they return:

                                  DEAN
                        Am I glad to see you! You were
                        gone so long! Wild Bill's making
                        noises like he's gonna wake up...
                               (notices Coffey)
                        What the hell's wrong with him?

                                  BRUTAL
                        He's hurting, Dean. Hurting bad.

              Dean jumps in, helps them steer Coffey into his cell.

                                  PAUL
                        John, we're gonna set you on your
                        bunk now. Ready?

              Coffey nods, sits heavily on the bunk. He lowers his head,
              breath rasping like a rusted hinge. The guards step out.

                                  DEAN
                        What about Mrs. Moores? Was it
                        like the mouse? Was it a...you
                        know...a miracle?

                                  PAUL
                        Yes. Yes it was.

              Paul scans their faces. Smiles are traded. An exultant beat.

                                  HARRY
                        Damn. I think we got away with it.

                                  BRUTAL
                        We still gotta convince a certain
                        somebody to keep his trap shut.

                                  PAUL
                        Get his stuff.

              Dean hurries off to retrieve Percy's holster and baton.
              Brutal unlocks the restraint room door, swings it open. Percy
              is revealed sitting against the wall, glaring, his mouth
              still taped. Paul crouches down. Brutal joins him.

                                  PAUL
                        I want to talk, not shout. I take
                        the tape off, you gonna be calm.

              Percy nods. Paul takes hold of the tape, preparing to yank.

                                  BRUTAL
                        My mother always said if you do it
                        fast, it won't hurt so much.

              Paul rips the tape off. Percy's eyes water with pain.

                                  BRUTAL
                        I guess she was wrong.

                                  PERCY
                        Get me out of this nut-coat.

                                  PAUL
                        In a minute.

                                  PERCY
                        Now! Now! Right n--

              Paul slaps him hard, knocks him sideways. Percy looks up,
              blinking in surprise. Paul grabs him, yanks him back up.

                                  PAUL
                        You shut up and listen. You
                        deserved to be punished for what
                        you did to Del. You'll accept it
                        like a man, or we'll make you
                        sorry you were ever born. We'll
                        tell people how you sabotaged
                        Del's execution--

                                  PERCY
                        Sabotaged!

                                  PAUL
                        --and how you pissed yourself like
                        a frightened little girl. Yes,
                        we'll talk, that's a given--but,
                        Percy, mind me now...we'll also
                        see you beaten within an inch of
                        your life.

              Percy blinks, unable to grasp that.

                                  PAUL
                        We know people, too, are you so
                        foolish you don't realize that?
                        People with friends and loved ones
                        doing time in this prison. People
                        who'd be happy to amputate you
                        nose or your penis just so someone
                        they care about could get an extra
                        three hours in the exercise yard
                        every week.
                               (off Percy's look)
                        Let bygones be bygones. Nothing's
                        hurt so far but your pride...and
                        nobody need ever know about that
                        except the people in this room.

                                  BRUTAL
                        What happens on the Mile, stays on
                        the Mile. Always has.

              A long pause. Softly:

                                  PERCY
                        May I be let out of this coat now?

              They pull him to his feet, undo the straps. He shrugs out of
              the straitjacket and adjusts his clothes, trying to maintain
              a shred of dignity.

                                  PERCY
                        My things?

              Dean hands them over. Percy smooths his hair and puts his hat
              on, starts strapping on his holster belt.

                                  PAUL
                        Think it over, Percy.

                                  PERCY
                        Oh, I intend to. I intend to think
                        about it very hard. Starting right
                        now.

              Percy exits the restraint room. Brutal whispers to Paul:

                                  BRUTAL
                        He'll talk. Sooner or later.

              Paul nods with weary resignation--yeah, I know.

              ON THE MILE

              Percy pauses near Coffey's cell, careless as always, getting
              his holster buckled--and a massive black arm grabs him
              through the bars. His SCREAM brings Paul and the others from
              the restraint room.

              Coffey's face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks
              like he's trying to push his head through. He draws his lips
              back, baring his teeth in an awful sneer...

              Percy whacks him with his baton. Coffey barely seems to feel
              it. He curls his free hand around the back of Percy's head,
              pulling him ever closer...

              ...and Percy's screams are muffled as their mouths come
              together. Coffey begins exhaling as if he'd held his breath
              for hours. Percy jerks like a fish on a hook, but can't get
              away. The men jump in, try to pry Percy loose, hollering for
              Coffey to let him go.

              The black "insects" are flowing from Coffey to Percy,
              swirling into his mouth, up his nose, down his throat.

              Several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down
              the Mile. Percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and
              clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again.

              And then Coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's
              tasted something bad. The color has returned to his skin.

              Percy, however, is ashen gray. His expression is blank as a
              sheet of paper, not a trace of awareness in his eyes.

              The men are stunned. Paul raises his hand to Percy's face,
              snaps his fingers. Nothing. He tries again, clapping loudly.
              Percy reacts slightly, eyes fluttering, swaying a bit.

                                  PAUL
                        Easy, easy. You all right?

              Percy says nothing. He turns and walks slowly up the Mile,
              his movements vacant and disjointed. He comes to a swaying
              stop at Wild Bill's cell...and turns slowly to look in.

              Wild Bill is coming painfully around, groggily clutching his
              head. He looks up, see Percy.

                                  BILLY
                        What'a you looking at, you limp
                        noodle? You wanna kiss my ass or
                        suck my dick?

              Nothing for the longest moment. Percy just staring...

              ...and then he pulls his gun and empties it into Wild Bill as
              fast as he can pull the trigger. BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!
              Bill takes all six rounds in the chest, reeling back across
              the cell. He hits the wall and slides down, leaving a smear,
              his face registering a final look of stunned surprise.

              Paul and the other tackle Percy and bring him down, wrestling
              the gun out of his hand. Dean is almost weeping:

                                  DEAN
                        Oh God, oh God, no...

              Percy is flat on his back, staring up at nothing. The black
              "bugs" come drifting out of nose and mouth, swirling in the
              air over his head. They turn white and disappear.

              The men are speechless. Paul turns, sees Coffey sitting on
              the floor at his bars, watching.

                                  COFFEY
                        Punished them bad men.

                                  PAUL
                        Why Wild Bill? Why?

                                  COFFEY
                        I saw in his heart. When he grab
                        my arm, I saw what Wild Billy
                        done. Saw plain as day. Can't hide
                        what's in your heart.

                                  PAUL
                        What? Saw what?

              Coffey reaches toward him, straining through the bars.

                                  COFFEY
                        Take my hand, boss. You see for
                        yourself.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Paul, no!

              Paul hesitates, torn between reason and Coffey's pleading
              eyes. A whisper:

                                  COFFEY
                        My hand.

              Paul can't help it. He has to. Their hands come together.
              Paul lurches wildly as that circuit starts blazing between
              them...

                                  PAUL
                        No...please...

                                  COFFEY
                        Gots to, boss. Gots to give you a
                        little bit of myself. A gift,
                        like. A gift of what's in me so
                        you can see...

              ...and Paul sees:

              The Detterick twins. Kathe and Cora. Laughing and playing
              hopscotch in the dust under a later afternoon sun...

              A dinner table. Family having supper late in the day, basket
              of biscuits being passed. Twelve year old Howie Detterick
              taking it, passing it on...

              An hand with a paint brush slopping bright red paint on the
              side of a barn...

              Kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares, turning
              and starting back, laughing in the sun...

              The paint brush slopping more paint, dripping like blood...

              Paul jerks and twists, trying to pull away, trying to break
              the circuit, but he can't, not till all is seen and done:

              Marjorie Detterick calling from the porch for everybody to
              come eat, supper's ready...

              A hammer pausing. Klaus looking down from atop the barn...

              The Detterick twins finishing their hopscotch, gathering
              their jump ropes from the dust, running across the yard...

              The basket of biscuits being passed to little Cora, who takes
              a biscuit and passes it on...

              Klaus coming down the ladder, calling to his daughters. The
              little girls running past the man with the paint brush, who
              turns and smile as they go by...it's Wild Bill.

              The basket of biscuits is passed one last time. A hand pulls
              one out, raises it for a bite. It's Wild Bill, smiling at the
              little girls as conversation flows around the table...

              Paul screams, trying to pull away, but:

              The porch door is kicked off its hinges just before dawn, a
              figure looming in the doorway. Kathe wakes, her scream cut
              short as the man's fist punches her hard in the face...

              Paul trembles violently as if riding the lightning himself,
              pleading for it to stop, but there's one last thing:

              Wild Bill looms over the terrified little girls like a
              horrendous boogeyman, whispers to Kathe:

                                  BILLY
                        You lover your sister? You make
                        any noise, know what happens? I'll
                        kill her instead of you.
                               (to Cora)
                        And if you make any noise, I'll
                        kill her.

              And he drags them out into the coming dawn...

              ...as Coffey lets Paul go. Paul is gasping, back in the real
              world where his men are staring at him with wide eyes.

                                  COFFEY
                        He kill 'em with they love. They
                        love for each other. You see how
                        it is?

              Paul nods, numb. Tears are flowing down Coffey's face. Softly:

                                  COFFEY
                        That's how it is ever' day. That's
                        how it is all over the worl'...

                                                       CUT TO:

              WILD BILL

              lies dead, staring with glassy eyes. A FLASHBULB POPS,
              rimming him with harsh blue light...

              INT. E BLOCK - DAWN

              ...as Hal arrives, wearing his pajama top under his overcoat.
              He sees the POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER taking pictures. The guards
              are giving statements to GROUPS OF COPS, everybody murmuring:

                                  DEAN
                        ...well, I dunno, he just snapped,
                        I guess...

                                  HARRY
                        ...s'right, one minute he's fine,
                        the next--blammo...

                                  BRUTAL
                        ...bastard grabbed him through the
                        bars a few days back, scared the
                        boy so bad he wet himself...

              Hal turns, sees:

              PERCY

              sits handcuffed on the floor of the Mile, eyes glassier than
              Wild Bill's. TWO COPS are trying to snap him out of it:

                                  COP #1
                        Son! Son! Can you hear me?

                                  COP #2
                        Speak up if you can hear us! We
                        gotta ask you some questions!

              A MEDIC is raising Percy's eyelid with his thumb, shining a
              penlight, getting no reaction.

                                  MEDIC
                        I think this boy's cheese slid off
                        his cracker.

              HAL

              sees Paul, motions him aside to talk privately:

                                  HAL
                        I'll cover you as much as I can,
                        even if it mean my job, but I have
                        to know. Does this have anything
                        to do with what happened at my
                        house? Does it, Paul?

              Paul looks Hal in the eye. As with Bitterbuck, the lie comes
              easy:

                                  PAUL
                        No.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

              TRACKING A PAIR OF FEET shuffling into the room in hospital
              slippers, escorted by TWO ORDERLIES. The patient is brought
              to a window. The orderlies turn to leave...

              ...and we BOOM UP to reveal Percy, catatonic, staring out the
              same window where we met Wild Bill...

              EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

              ...and we WIDEN SLOWLY from Percy at the window to reveal his
              last stop in life. It's emblazoned on the gate: BRIAR RIDGE
              MENTAL HOSPITAL. He finally got that transfer.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK

              TIGHT ON PAUL as softly:

                                  PAUL
                        It makes sense. I read the file.
                        Hal even said it himself. Wharton
                        rambled all over the state last
                        few years, causing trouble. Hell,
                        longer than that. Been at it since
                        he was ten. Vandalism. Petty
                        theft. Setting fires.

              ANGLE SHIFTS to include Jan, Brutal, Harry and Dean. They're
              in the brambly patch that borders the woods behind the house.
              The sun is setting, turning the horizon fiery.

                                  JAN
                        You saw him. You actually saw this
                        Wild Bill person take those girls.

                                  PAUL
                        Their father hired him on for a
                        few days last spring, help repair
                        the barn. Cheap labor, just
                        another drifter...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Only not.

                                  PAUL
                        Sick bastard came back a month
                        later, just before dawn. Took the
                        girls...did what he did. Coffey
                        found them afterwards and tried to
                        help. It was too late.

                                  JAN
                               (absorbs this)
                        Then you can stop it. The
                        execution, I mean. Get Coffey a
                        new trial.

                                  PAUL
                        Based on what, honey? Some kind of
                        magical vision I had?

                                  JAN
                        Show this farmer--what's his name,
                        Detterick?--show him a picture of
                        Wild Bill.
                               (off their looks)
                        Why not? If Wharton was there...if
                        the farmer can identify his
                        picture and they know he was
                        there...

                                  BRUTAL
                        Him being there in May doesn't
                        mean he came back and killed those
                        girls in June. Even if he was
                        committing other crimes.

                                  PAUL
                        They got their killer as far as
                        they're concerned.

                        Hell, Coffey's own lawyer would
                        come throw the switch if we let
                        him.

                                  JAN
                        Then lie.

                                  PAUL
                        Lie? About what?

                                  JAN
                        Tell them Wharton confessed to the
                        crime. Brutus, you can back him
                        up, say you heard it too. You can
                        say that's what set Percy off. He
                        shot Wharton because he couldn't
                        stand thinking of what happened to
                        those two little girls, it snapped
                        his mind...
                               (seeing their looks)
                        ...what? What now?

                                  DEAN
                        We never reported anything like
                        that. We would've, too, everybody
                        knows it. It's part of our job.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Besides, confessing don't make it
                        so. Slugs like Wild Bill lie about
                        everything. Crimes they committed,
                        women they had, even the weather.

                                  JAN
                        But he was there! He painted their
                        barn! He ate dinner with them!

                                  PAUL
                        All the more reason he might take
                        credit for the crime. He's gonna
                        fry anyway, so why not boast?

              Jan stands thinking for a moment, then:

                                  JAN
                        All right. Then you've got to get
                        John Coffey out on your own.

                                  HARRY
                        Ma'am?

                                  JAN
                        You did it once, didn't you? Only
                        this time, don't bring him back.

              Dean blinks, stunned by this notion. Gently:

                                  DEAN
                        Ma'am, your son's grown up and
                        moved away. My kids are just
                        starting kindergarten. Will you be
                        the one to explain to them why
                        their daddy's in prison?

                                  JAN
                        Work out a plan. Make it look like
                        a real escape.

                                  HARRY
                        Better be a plan an imbecile could
                        dream up. Nobody'd believe it
                        otherwise.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Even if we did think of something,
                        it wouldn't do any good.

                                  JAN
                        Why not? Just why the hell not?

                                  PAUL
                        Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch
                        baldheaded black man with barely
                        enough brains to feed himself. How
                        long you think it'd be before he
                        was recaptured? Two hours? Six?

              Jan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand. Softly:

                                  JAN
                        Do you mean to kill him, you
                        cowards? Do you?

              Paul tries to take her hand. She wrenches away, furious.

                                  JAN
                        Don't touch me! Next week this
                        time you'll be a murderer, no
                        better than that man Wharton, so
                        don't touch me!

              She runs off toward the house, starting to sob as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT  PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

              Paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours, at his regular
              place, sipping his beer. Irving Berlin's "Remember" PLAYS
              SOFTLY on the radio. Jan comes down, looking miserable and
              exhausted.

                                  JAN
                        I'm so sorry I called you a
                        coward. I feel worse about that
                        than anything I've ever said to
                        you in our whole marriage.

                                  PAUL
                        Even that time we went camping and
                        you called me Old Stinky Sam?

              She can't help smiling at that. He returns the smile, offers
              her a sip of beer. She takes it, sits.

                                  JAN
                        Does Hal know? That Coffey's
                        innocent, I mean?
                               (Paul shakes his head)
                        Can he help? Does he have the
                        influence to do something about
                        this?

                                  PAUL
                        No.

                                  JAN
                        Then don't tell him. If he can't
                        help, don't tell him. Ever.

                                  PAUL
                        I won't.

                                  JAN
                               (beat)
                        There's no way out of this for
                        you, is there?

                                  PAUL
                        No. I've been thinking about it,
                        too, believe me.
                               (beat)
                        Tell you the truth, honey. I've
                        done some things in my life I'm
                        not proud of, but this is the
                        first time I've ever felt in real
                        danger of hell.

                                  JAN
                        Hell? Oh Paul...
                               (touches his face)
                        Talk to him. Talk to John. Find
                        out what he wants.

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              Coffey sits quietly in his cell, a solitary firefly flitting
              in circles around his finger. Paul and the men appear. The
              firefly flits away, vanishing through Coffey's tiny window.

                                  COFFEY
                        Hello, boss.

                                  PAUL
                        Hello, John.

              Brutal unlocks his cell. Paul enters.

                                  PAUL
                        I guess you know we're coming down
                        to it now. Another couple of days.
                               (beat)
                        Is there anything special you'd
                        like for dinner that night? We can
                        rustle you up most anything.

              Coffey gives it some careful thought.

                                  COFFEY
                        Meatloaf be nice. Mashed taters
                        with gravy. Okra, maybe. I's not
                        picky.

                                  PAUL
                        What about a preacher? Someone you
                        could say a little prayer with?

                                  COFFEY
                        Don't want no preacher. You can
                        say a prayer, if you want. I could
                        get kneebound with you, I guess.

                                  PAUL
                        Me?

              Coffey gives him a look--please.

                                  PAUL
                        S'pose I could, if it came to that.

              Paul sits, working himself up to it:

                                  PAUL
                        John, I have to ask you something
                        very important right now.

                        I know what you gonna say. You
                        don' have to say it.

                                  PAUL
                        I do. I do have to.
                               (beat)
                        John, tell me what you want me to
                        do. You want me to take you out of
                        here? Just let you run away? See
                        how far you can get?

                        Why would you do such a foolish
                        thing?

              Paul hesitates, emotions swirling, trying to find the right
              words.

                                  PAUL
                        On the day of my judgement, when
                        I stand before God, and He asks me
                        why did I kill one of his true
                        miracles, what am I gonna say?
                        That is was my job? My job?

                                  COFFEY
                        You tell God the Father it was a
                        kindness you done.
                               (takes his hand)
                        I know you hurtin' and worryin',
                        I can feel it on you, but you
                        oughtta quit on it now. Because I
                        want it over and done. I do.

              Coffey hesitates--now he's the one trying to find the right
              words, trying to make Paul understand:

                                  COFFEY
                        I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on
                        the road, lonely as a sparrow in
                        the rain. Tired of not ever having
                        me a buddy to be with, or tell me
                        where we's coming from or going
                        to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of
                        people being ugly to each other.

                        I'm tired of all the pain I feel
                        and hear in the world ever' day.
                        There's too much of it. It's like
                        pieces of glass in my head all the
                        time. Can you understand?

              By now, Paul is blinking back tears. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        Yes, John. I think I can.

                                  BRUTAL
                        There must be something we can do
                        for you, John. There must be
                        something you want.

              Coffey thinks about this long and hard, finally looks up.

                                  COFFEY
                        I ain't never seen me a flicker
                        show.

                                                       CUT TO:

              TIGHT ON COFFEY'S FACE

              gazing with wide-eyed, open-mouthed wonder, the light of a
              motion picture projector flickering on his skin...

              INT  PRISON AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

              ...while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance up there on the
              big screen, images flowing in magical black and silver tone.

                                  FRED ASTAIRE
                               (singing)
                        Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my
                        heart beats so that I can hardly
                        speak...

              Paul and the men are scattered about in the otherwise empty
              auditorium, also watching.

              PROJECTION BOOTH

              Toot operates the projector, peering through the tiny window
              into the theater. He yawns, glances at his watch. Late.

              IN THE AUDITORIUM

              Fred and Ginger are now in the most passionate and graceful
              part of the dance. Irving Berlin's music swells.

              COFFEY

              can't believe what he's seeing. He's so excited his breath is
              caught in his throat. Softly:

                                  COFFEY
                        Why, they's angels. Angels. Just
                        like up in heaven...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT

              FOUR PAIRS OF FEET come marching up the Green Mile.

              ANGLE ON COFFEY

              Paul appears at the bars with Brutal, Harry, and Dean.
              Nothing is said. Coffey knows why they're here. He rises as
              Brutal unlocks the cell, slides the door open. Coffey steps
              out, looks around at their dazed and sad faces.

                                  COFFEY
                        I be all right, fellas. This
                        here's the hard part. I be all
                        right in a little while.

              Paul indicates St. Christopher medal around John's neck:

                                  PAUL
                        John, I should have that just for
                        now. I'll give it back after.

              John lets him take the necklace. Paul pockets it. They start
              to walk the Mile as:

                                  COFFEY
                        You know, I fell asleep this
                        afternoon and had me a dream. I
                        dreamed about Del's mouse.

                                  PAUL
                        Did you, John?

                                  COFFEY
                        I dreamed he got down to that
                        place Boss Howell talked about,
                        that Mouseville place. I dreamed
                        there was kids, and how they
                        laughed at his tricks! My!

              He laughs at the memory of it, then grows more serious:

                                  COFFEY
                        I dreamed those two little blonde-
                        headed girls were there. They 'us
                        laughing, too. I put my arms
                        around 'em and sat 'em on my
                        knees, and there 'us no blood
                        comin' outta their hair and they
                        'us fine. We all watch Mr. Jingles
                        roll that spool, and how we did
                        laugh. Fit to bus', we was.

              Behind them, Dean stifles a sob.

              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE

              Coffey kneels. Paul joins him, self-conscious and uncertain.

                                  PAUL
                        What should we pray for, John?

                                  COFFEY
                        Strength?

              Paul nods--strength it is. Dean surprises Brutal and Harry by
              also kneeling. Brutal and Harry hesitate...then join them.

                                  PAUL
                        God, please help us finish what
                        we've started, and please welcome
                        this man, John Coffey--like the
                        drink, but not spelled the same--
                        into heaven and give him peace.
                        Please help us to see him off the
                        best we can and let nothing go
                        wrong. Amen.

              Paul starts to rise, but Coffey takes his hand.

                                  COFFEY
                        I know a prayer I once heard. Can
                        I say it?

                                  PAUL
                        You go right ahead, John. Take all
                        the time you need.

              Coffey closes his eyes, frowning in deep concentration.

                                  COFFEY
                        Baby Jesus, meek and mild, pray
                        for me...

              And Paul sees:

              Kathe and Cora Detterick kneeling together in the enclosed
              porch that night, just before their bedtime:

                                  KATHE AND CORA
                        ...and every child. Be my
                        strength, be my friend...

              And then the vision is gone as:

                                  COFFEY
                        ...be with me until the end. Amen.

              Coffey rises, offers Paul his hand, helps him up.

              EXECUTION CHAMBER

              Full house tonight. Bill Dodge is waiting at Old Sparky.

              Silence as Coffey is led in, all eyes on him. Klaus and
              Marjorie Detterick are in the front row. She mutters:

                                  MARJORIE
                        Die slow, you bastard.

              COFFEY

              is faltering as Paul and Brutal bring him to the chair.

                                  COFFEY
                        They's a lot of folks here hate
                        me. A lot. I can feel it. Like
                        bees stinging me. It hurts.

                                  BRUTAL
                        Feel how we feel, then. We don't
                        hate you--can you feel that?

              Coffey tries to take comfort in it, but flinches as:

                                  MARJORIE
                        Kill him twice, you boys! You go
                        on and kill that raping baby-
                        killer twice, that'd be fine!

              She dissolves into tears. Klaus pulls her against his
              shoulder, looking dazed by the whole thing.

              Paul and Brutal turn John around, sit him down. Paul notices
              Dean crying again, his back to the witnesses. They kneel to
              apply the leg clamps, while Brutal and Harry secure the arms.

                                  PAUL
                        Wipe you face before you stand up,
                        Dean.

              Dean nods, wiping his face with the sleeve of his coat. They
              rise, stepping back. This time, Paul's out front:

                                  PAUL
                        Roll on one.

              Van Hay cranks the generator. The lights flare hotter and
              brighter. It's just like in Melinda's bedroom the night
              Coffey cured her with a kiss. Airless and bright, dreamlike.

                                  MARJORIE
                        Does it hurt yet? I hope it does!
                        I hope it hurts like hell!

                                  PAUL
                        John Coffey...you have been
                        condemned to die in the electric
                        chair by a jury of your
                        peers...sentence imposed by a
                        judge in good standing in this
                        state. Do you have anything to say
                        before sentence is carried out?

              John hesitates, nods.

                                  COFFEY
                        I'm sorry for what I am.

                                  MARJORIE
                        You ought to be! Oh, you monster,
                        you damn well ought to be!

              Brutal takes the mask from the hook to draw it over Coffey's
              head. Coffey looks to Paul with terrified, pleading eyes.

                                  COFFEY
                        Please, boss, don't put that thing
                        over my face. Don't put me in the
                        dark, I's afraid of the dark.

                                  PAUL
                        All right, John.

              Brutal puts the mask back, proceeds with the sponge.

              IN TIGHT ANGLES

              The cap is lowered, the straps drawn. Coffey is breathing
              fast, terrified, muttering under his breath:

                                  COFFEY
                        ...heaven...I'm in heaven...
                        heaven...heaven...heaven...

              THE WITNESSES

              sit and wait, barely breathing.

              JACK VAN HAY

              is poised at the switch, wondering why the order won't come.

              PAUL

              is staring at Coffey, unable to say the words.

                                  BRUTAL
                               (whispers)
                        Paul. You have to say it. You have
                        to give the order.

              Paul can't. He reaches out and touches Coffey's hand. Their
              fingers clasp. In that moment, staring into his eyes, Paul
              hears the last thought that ever goes through Coffey's head:

                                  COFFEY
                               (whispered V.O.)
                        He kill 'em with they love. That's
                        how it is ever' day. All over the
                        worl'...

              Their fingers disengage. Paul steps back, eyes still locked
              with Coffey's, and says the hardest words he's ever spoken:

                                  PAUL
                        Roll on two.

              Van Hay throws the switch. Coffey surges forward, fingers
              splayed and jittering past Old Sparky's arms.

              Lights begin blowing out all over the Mile, raining shattered
              glass and sparks. Some of the witnesses scream.

              A thin line of blood comes trickling out of Klaus Detterick's
              nose. He reaches up, absently wipes it away.

              Coffey's eyes are locked on Paul's, riding the lightning all
              the way. He finally slumps. Van Hay kills the current.

              Coffey's expression is peaceful, as if sleeping. A final pair
              of tears drift gently down his cheeks.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

              Paul ever so carefully replaces the St. Christopher's medal
              around Coffey's neck. They wheel him down the tunnel.

                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. PAUL'S MODEL T - NIGHT

              Paul drives home, his heart numb.

              EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

              Paul pulls in, cuts the engine. He sits for a moment, then
              gets out and heads for the house.

              The door opens. Jan steps out in her nightgown and robe to
              meet him on the stairs. She takes him in her arms.

              Paul can't hold it back anymore. He breaks down sobbing
              against her as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. NURSING HOME SUNROOM - PRESENT DAY

              It's late in the day as:

                                  PAUL
                        That was the last execution I ever
                        took part in. Just couldn't do it
                        anymore after that. Brutal either.
                        We both transferred out, took jobs
                        with Boys' Correctional.
                               (beat, nods)
                        That was all right. Catch 'em
                        young, that became my motto. Might
                        even have done some good.

              ANGLE SHIFTS TO Elaine listening. Uncertain.

                                  PAUL
                        You don't believe me.

                                  ELAINE
                        I don't imagine you would lie to
                        me, Paul. It's just that...

                                  PAUL
                        ...It's quite a story.

                                  ELAINE
                        Yes. Quite a story.
                               (pause)
                        One thing I don't understand. You
                        said you and Jan had a grownup son
                        in 1935. Is that right?
                               (Paul nods)
                        But if that's true...

                                  PAUL
                        The math doesn't work, does it?

              She shakes her head. Paul thinks for a moment, comes to a
              decision.

                                  PAUL
                        You feel up to a walk?

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. GEORGIA PINES - DAY

              The rain has mostly stopped. Brad Dolan, back in street
              clothes, gets in his pickup truck and drives away...

              INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

              ...while Paul and Elaine watch from a window.

              EXT. GEORGIA PINES - DAY

              This time, we see two red specks trudging slowly up the ridge
              toward the treeline.

                                                       CUT TO:

              EXT. WOODS - DAY

              Paul brings Elaine along the wooded path into view of the
              storage shacks. They're both wearing ponchos.

                                  PAUL
                        There. It's in there.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul? This thing you want to show
                        me. Is it scary?

                                  PAUL
                        Scary? No. Not really.

              He gives her a smile, offers his hand. She takes it.

              INT. SHACK - DAY

              We see Paul approach through the grimy window as before, this
              time bringing Elaine. ANGLE SHIFTS to the door as they
              arrive, creaking open on rusty hinges to reveal them.

              They enter. Elaine looks around at the musty nooks and
              crannies, wondering what they're doing here. Paul touchers
              arm, directs her attention:

                                  PAUL
                        There.

              Elaine moves closer, sees it on the dusty floorboards:

              An old cigar box.

              For a moment, she doesn't know what to make of it.

                                  PAUL
                        Hey. Wake up, old boy. Wake up.

              Elaine's breath catches in her throat...

              ...as a pair of bright oilspot eyes peer over the edge of the
              cigar box. It's a mouse. His fur, once brown, is now all gray.

                                  ELAINE
                        Paul? It isn't...it can't be...

              Paul gets down on the floor, holds out his hand.

                                  PAUL
                        Come over here, boy. Come on over
                        her and see this lady.

              The mouse tries several times to get over the side of the
              cigar box before he finally makes it. He comes to them,
              hobbling and crippled with arthritis. Paul pulls a slice of
              toast from his pocket, breaks off a small piece for the mouse.

                                  ELAINE
                        That can't be Mr. Jingles.

              Paul says nothing, just pulls a spool from his pocket. Mr.
              Jingles might be old, but he's as obsessed as ever. He gets
              ready to fetch, eyes riveted to the spool. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        Messieurs et mesdames. Beinvenue
                        au cirque du mousie.

              Paul tosses the spool. The mouse limps painfully after it. He
              reaches it, goes around...and has to lay down to catch his
              breath. Elaine starts forward, but Paul holds her back.

              After a moment, Mr. Jingles finds his feet again. He rises
              and starts nosing the spool back to Paul.

                                  ELAINE
                        Oh, Paul. Don't make him do it
                        again. I can't bear to watch.

                                  PAUL
                               (softly)
                        But he loves it so much.

              He glances around at the shack with a sad smile.

                                  PAUL
                        This isn't exactly the Mouseville
                        we had in mind...but we make do,
                        don't we, old fella?

                                  BRAD (O.S.)
                        As I live and breathe!

              They gasp and spin. Brad Dolan stands in the doorway.

                                  BRAD
                        Fooled you, didn't I Got yourself
                        a little love nest here, I see...

              He pauses, seeing Mr. Jingles.

                                  BRAD
                        ...what the fuck? Is that a mouse?

                                  PAUL
                        Don't hurt him, okay? Okay?

                                  BRAD
                        It's a goddamn mouse, y'old fool,
                        they carry all kind'a disease...

              Brad grabs an old garden hoe--the blade's rusted, but still
              sharp enough to cut a mouse in two.

                                  BRAD
                        ...now step aside.

              Paul rushes in front of Brad, fists clenched, yelling:

                                  PAUL
                        You leave him alone, Percy! You
                        leave him alone, or by God I'll--

              Brad gives Paul a hard shove, pins him against the wall.

                                  BRAD
                        Who you calling Percy? Name's
                        Brad, you senile fucker. And I'm
                        gonna nail that mouse, you can
                        take that to the everfucking bank.

              Elaine is suddenly at Brad's elbow, seething with fury:

                                  ELAINE
                        How dare you? Get out!

                                  BRAD
                        Piss off, you wrinkeldy old bitch.
                        Me and Paulie are talking.

                                  ELAINE
                        His name is Mr. Edgecomb. If you
                        ever call him Paulie again, your
                        days of employment at Georgia
                        Pines will end.

                                  BRAD
                        Who the hell you think you are?

                                  ELAINE
                        I am the grandmother of the man
                        who is currently Speaker of the
                        Georgia House of Representatives.
                        A man who loves his relatives, Mr.
                        Dolan. All it would take is a
                        phone call.

              Brad's smile falters. Elaine steps closer.

                                  ELAINE
                        At first I thought I'd let you be.
                        I'm old, and that seemed easiest.
                        But when my friends are threatened
                        and abused, I do not let it be.
                               (icy beat)
                        Now get out, or you won't work
                        another day here. Not another
                        hour. I swear it.

              Brad eases his grip on Paul...and backs off.

                                  BRAD
                        Don't know what you're getting so
                        het up about. Just a damn mouse.

                                  ELAINE
                        Get out, you ignorant man. What
                        little mind you have is ugly and
                        misdirected.

              Brad flushes red, heads for the door. He pauses.

                                  BRAD
                        Don't bother coming back here
                        tomorrow...Mr. Edgecomb Gonna be
                        a new lock on this door. This is
                        off-limits to residents, no matter
                        what Mrs. My Shit Don't Stink has
                        to say about it.

              And off he goes. Paul tries to control the shaking in his
              hands, looks to Elaine.

                                  ELAINE
                        Little trick I learned from Percy
                        Wetmore.

                                  PAUL
                        Is your grandson really Speaker of
                        the House?

                                  ELAINE
                        He is.

              Paul bends down, picks Mr. Jingles up.

                                  PAUL
                        You gonna thank the lady? She just
                        saved your old mousie hide.

              The mouse stretches his neck forward, nose twitching,
              smelling Paul's breath. Paul looks to Elaine. Softly:

                                  PAUL
                        I think Mr. Jingles happened by
                        accident. I think when we
                        electrocuted Del, and it all went
                        so badly...well, John could feel
                        it, you know...and I think a tiny
                        part of whatever was inside of him
                        just leapt out...
                               (beat)
                        Me, I was no accident. John had to
                        give me a little part of
                        himself...a gift, like...so I
                        could see for myself what Wild
                        Bill had done. When John did that,
                        a part of whatever power worked
                        through him spilled into me.

                                  ELAINE
                        He...what? Infected you with life?

              Paul looks at the mouse, strokes him gently between the ears.

                                  PAUL
                        That's as good a word as any. He
                        infected us both, didn't he, Mr.
                        Jingles. With life.
                               (beat)
                        I'm a hundred and five years old,
                        Elaine. I was forty the year John
                        Coffey walked the Green Mile.

                                  ELAINE
                        ...oh my God...

              CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN on Paul as:

                                  PAUL
                        I haven't even had a cold since
                        1935. I've had to watch my friends
                        and loved ones die off through the
                        years...Hal and Melinda...Brutus
                        Howell...my wife...my son...
                               (beat)
                        ...and you, Elaine. You'd die,
                        too, and my curse is knowing I'll
                        be there to see it...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

              Paul, dressed in a dark suit, comes up the aisle. ANGLE
              SHIFTS to reveal Elaine Connelly lying in the open casket.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        ...that's my punishment, you see?
                        My punishment for letting John
                        Coffey ride the lightning...for
                        killing a miracle of God...

              Paul lays a rose atop the casket.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        ...you'll be gone, like all the
                        others, and I'll have to stay...

              EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

              Paul stands at the graveside as the casket is lowered.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        I'll die eventually, I imagine. I
                        have no illusions of immortality.
                        But I will have wished for death
                        long before death finds me.

              He turns and walks away.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        In truth, I wish for it already.

              INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT(1935)

              Empty and silent. Young Paul walks the Mile alone, listening
              to the quiet. He pauses, seeing something. A whisper:

                                  PAUL
                        Mr. Jingles?

              It is Mr. Jingles. The little mouse is peering from under the
              restraint room door. He's come home, looking bedraggled. Paul
              bends down, gently picks him up.

                                  PAUL
                        Where you been, boy? I've been
                        worried about you. You hungry?

              Paul turns and head back up the Green Mile, carrying the
              mouse cupped in his hands as we

                                                       MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

              Young Paul transforms into Old Paul in the dissolve, the
              corridor of the Green Mile becoming the corridor of the
              nursing home. He's walking along, holding the little mouse
              the same way he did over sixty years ago.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        I lie in bed most nights, thinking
                        about it. And I wait...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

              Paul lies awake, staring at the moon outside his window.

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        I think about all the people I've
                        loved, now long gone.

                        I think about my beautiful Jan,
                        and how I lost her so many years
                        ago. I think about all of us
                        walking our own Green Mile, each
                        in our own time. But one thought,
                        more than any other, keeps me
                        awake most nights...
                               (beat)
                        ...if he could make a mouse live
                        so long, how much longer do I have?

              He looks over at the nightstand...

                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                        We each owe a death, there are no
                        exceptions, but sometimes, oh God,
                        the Green Mile is so long...

          HONG KONG - AN OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE
          Crowded. Filled with oriental and British merchants.
          You can buy anything here. Electronics. Food. Any-
          thing.

          RAND PELTZER
          walks through the owd. An American businessman.1-He
          wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished
          good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old.
          Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people
          and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL,
          WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite
          smile.

          RAND
          Hi. I'm from out of town...
          on business from the U.S.
          The woman nods and smiles.

          AN ORIENTAL MAN
          passes by. He is very old. Deep wrinkles. Long white
          hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing
          Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop.

          RAND
          (explaining to
          Oriental woman)
          I'm looking for a present...
          for my son.
          The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She
          holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head.

          RAND
          He's not really involved in
          sports...
          The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony
          "Walkman". Rand again shakes his head.,

          RAND
          No. I want something unusual...
          something he can't get at home...
          something different..

          
          

          .2.

          A HAND
          reaches out and grabs Rand's arm. Startled, he turns.
          The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's
          eyes.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I can help you.
          He leads Rand away from the booth.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I offer something very different.
          Very unusual.
          Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Follow me.
          He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow. Rand
          pauses, skeptical.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Come. Take a look. It will cost
          you nothing.
          (a beat)
          You won't be disappointed.
          The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and follows.

          INSIDE
          Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs.
          At the top, they enter a room.

          INT. ROOM

          Dark. No windows. No furniture. Filled with cardboard
          boxes and wooden crates.
          Rand crinkles his nose. It su,Qlls bad in here.
          The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb. He leads the
          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.
          The Oriental picks up a small, metal box. A HIGH PITCHED
          GIGGLE echoes from inside the box.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          Rand is very puzzled.
          The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens
          the box.
          A TINY CREATURE is inside'.
          The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on
          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered
          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The
          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.
          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,
          square teeth.
          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.
          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything
          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney
          character.
          The Oriental claps his hands.
          The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder.
          The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the
          creature.
          The Oriental claps his hands again.
          The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand
          with those cute green eyes'.

          RAND
          (to the Oriental)
          What is it?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It is called ' Mogwai ' .
          (a beat)
          A very rare and intelligent animal.
          I found it in the fields near my
          home It will obey all orders.
          It learns fast.
          The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          (Chinese,; English

          SUBTITLES)

          

          

          

          

          4
          --Mogwai leaps to the ground. It scurries across the floor,
          to a wooden crate.
          Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate. It tears off a
          chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man..
          He takes the fish. Mogwai hops back into the box.
          Rand shakes his head. Amazed by the animal.
          he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs
          own his chin. He smiles at Rand.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          And if you are ever in need of
          a song...
          He claps his hands to the creature.

          ORIENTAL MAN.
          (Chinese; English

          SUBTITLES)
          Music.
          Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It's
          beautiful.
          Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.

          RAND -
          How much?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          One hundred American Dollars.
          Cash.
          Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives
          them to the man.
          The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps
          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute
          giggle.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It never sleeps. It will eat any-
          thing... but prefers raw meat.

          (PAUSE)
          It must always be kept indoors during
          the day. It lives in shadow. It
          hates bright light. Direct sunlight
          will kill it.
          Rand nods. He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it
          into the box. Rand puts the box under his arm. The
          Oriental smiles

          

          

          

          

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Your son will enjoy his new friend.
          Rand smiles and exits. The Oriental takes a bite from
          his raw fish.

          CUT TO:..

          INT. HONG KONG AIRPORT

          Rand is on the pay telephon His baggage rests beside
          him.
          Mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box. The creature's
          bright eyes shine from inside.

          RAND
          (into the phone)
          Yes, Fred. The Tai-Chan account
          is definite. MmmHmm. My plane
          l eaves in twenty minutes. See
          you in Pennsylvania.
          He hangs up. He picks up his bags and walks to the check-
          in counter.

          THE CHECK-IN GIRL
          tags Mogwai's box and puts it on the conveyer belt.
          Rand watches the box disappear through the baggage chute.

          CHECK-IN GIRL
          Don't worry, sir. Your pet will
          be safe.
          Rand smiles.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SKY

          The jet flies through the clouds.

          INT. AIRPLANE

          Rand is eating his airline dinner. AN ORIENTAL STEWARDESS
          walks up and refills his coffee. He looks at her.
          with the word 'Mogwai'?

          

          

          

          

          6.
          She nods.

          RAND
          What does it mean?

          STEWARDESS
          Devil.
          She moves to the next passenger.
          Rand stares. Surprised. Confused.

          BILLY PELTZER
          a bank teller, writes out a receipt for a customer.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          Billy is 26 years old. His sturdy build and good looks are
          buried beneath wire rimmed glasses, slicked dirty-blonde
          .hair, a red sweater vest, a loose fitting checkered shirt,
          baggy corduroys and worn loafers.
          râ¢ Finishing the transaction with his customer, Billy looks to
          the line of waiting people.

          BILLY
          Next.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          an elderly woman, walks to Billy's window. She's a real
          prude. Tight lips. Heavy make-up. Bleached hair. Cheap
          fur coat. She hands Billy a personal check.

          TRACY ALLEN
          another teller, works beside Billy. Tracy is pretty. Big
          brown eyes. A sexy smile. Long dark hair. Perfect figure.
          25 years old.
          Tracy counts out some cash to a customer. She's trying
          to concentrate, to keep her mind on work.. But it's diffi-
          cult when

          GARY LUCIA
          the bank security guard, is trying to make her laugh. He
          stands by the bank entrance, making funny faces at Tracy.
          Gary is 30 years old. Former high school jock. Dark,
           thick hair. Deep brown eyes. Muscular. A strong, handsome
          face.
          Meanwhile, Billy gives the check back to Mrs. Deagle.

          BILLY
          I can't cash this, M'am. Your
          last check hasn't cleared.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't you recognize me?

          BILLY
          No, M'am. I'm sorry...

          

          

          

          

          8.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          (loud, so everyone can

          HEAR)
          My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle! My
          husband manages the.Sparkle Market!
          We've been banking here for sixteen
          years!

          BILLY
          T at's very nice, M'am. But your
          c eck hasn't cleared and...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          That's the problem with this world.
          It's a mess because of people like

          JI$

          BILLY
          It's not my.fault your check didn't
          clear, M'am,

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't get smart with me, oung man.

          BILLY
          I wasn't getting smart, I was...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          (shouting,-looking

          AROUND)
          Where's the president? I want to
          see the bank president!
          Billy rubs his eyes. Tense. Embarrassed.
          Everyone watches the scene. Tracy. Gary. The customers.

          ROLAND FRESCO
          the bank's Vice President, walks over to Billy and Mrs.
          beagle. Roland is tall, slender with thin grey hair and
          a pencil thin moustache. Friendliness and courtesy are
          his job. He smiles at Mrs. Deagle.

          ROLAND
          What seems to be the problem,
          M'am?

          MRS. DEAGLE
          My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This
          young teller is being very rude! I
          demand that you fire him!

          

          

          

          

          9
          Roland looks at Billy. Billy rolls his eyes. Roland
          smiles.

          ROLAND

          (COMFORTING)
          Now,-Mrs. Deagle...I'm sure this
          isn't that serious. I'm sure an
          apology would fix things right
          up. Wouldn't it?
          The woman shrugs.' Roland turns to Billy.

          ROLAND
          Apologize to the woman, Billy.
          Billy leans to Roland.

          BILLY
          (angry whisper)
          I. didn't do anything wrong.

          AA;

          ROLAND
          (doesn't care, the
          customer comes first)
          Just apologize.
          Roland.leans back and smiles at Mrs. Deagle.
          Billy looks at her. He doesn'-t want to do this.
          Everyone in the bank is watching him, waiting for him
          to take a stand.
          Billy sighs. He needs his job.

          BILLÂ°
          (forcing himself)
          I'm sorry, Mrs. Deagle.
          She nods and smiles. Roland puts his hand on the woman's
          shoulder.

          ROLAND
          Come back to my desk, Mrs. Deagle.
          I'll personally take care of your
          banking problems.
          Roland walks back to his office with Mrs. Deagle.
          Gary chuckles. Tracy goes back to work.
          Billy just sits. Angry. Humiliated. He calls the next
          customer.

          INT. BANK - LATER

          Billy puts on his brown winter coat and green scarf.
          He picks up his dog eared copy of "The Once And Future
          King". He walks to the bank lobby.

          TRACY
          stands in the lobby, putting on.her coat. Billy moves to
          help her.

          BILLY
          Let me.
          He helps her on with the coat.

          BILLY
          You look very pretty today.

          TRACY

          (FLATTERED)
          Thanks, Billy.

          BILLY
          I mean.. .not that you don't look
          pretty every day...But you look
          especially pretty today.

          TRACY

          (CHUCKLES)
          You're cute.
          Gary walks up. He puts his arm through Tracy's.

          GARY
          Let's go. I'm hungry.
          (notices Billy)
          Hey, Peltzer...Whydidn't you stand.
          up to that old bag, today?

          11.
          Billy shrugs. Embarrassed.
          Gary notices the book. He takes it from Billy's hand.

          GARY
          What's this?

          BILLY
          It's a book. You read 1t.
          Billy exchanges a smile with Tracy. Gary isn't amused.

          GARY
          I know that, asshole. I meant
          what's it about?

          BILLY
          King Arthur. . .Sir Lancelot... Knights
          of the Round . Table... Dragons...

          GARY
          Aren't you a little old for that
          kinda' junk?

          BILLY

          Beats T.V.

          GARY-
          (gives Billy the

          BOOK)
          I'll take 'Monday Night Football'
          over this crap any day.
          (takes Tracy's arm)
          C'mon. Let's go.
          Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away.
          Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side.
          He lifts the sword and lunges forward. At Gary.
          Billy sits at a table. Alone. He's reading his book. He
          eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He's fas-
          cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny
          section.. He laughs.

          

          

          

          

          12.
          Gary notices Billy. Gary nudges the others.

          GARY
          What a nut. Laughin' to himself.
          That's the kind of guy who'll shoot
          a president.

          TRACY

          (DEFENSIVE)
          I don't see anything wrong with him.
          I'm sure he's very intelligent.

          GARY
          Yeah, and those are the guys who
          always crack. The real smart guys.
          6ti (pause)
           He's gotta be a psycho. 26 years old,
          still lives with his parents. Doesn't
          have a girlfriend. He's always alone.
          Real weirdo.
          The others agree. Tracy doesn't. She likes Billy.
          Billy continues to read, totally caught up in his book.
          Totally caught up in his fantasy.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BILLY'S FORD PINTO - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          Billy drives home from work. He moves slow. The snow
          still falls. The roads are icy.

          CAR RADIO (V.0.)
          .And the snow keeps coming, folks.
          Looks like we're gonna have a White
          Christmas. Another three inches is
          expected tonight...
          Billy looks out of his side window and sees

          PETE FOUNTANE
          walking home from school. Pete is 16 years old. A chunky,
           pleasant baby faced kid. With his bright orange down jacket,
          Pete resembles a tiny snowman.
          Suddenly, Pete.slips on the ice. Bam. Right on his ass.
          His school books scatter over the ground.

          

          

          

          

          13.
          Billy stops the car. He gets out and hurries to Pete.

          BILLY
          Pete...You okay?
          Pete nods. Billy helps him up. Pete brushes himself off.
          Billy is amused by the boy.

          BILLY
          You want a ride home?

          PETE
          Thanks. That'd be nice.
          Billy helps Pete pick up his schoolbooks.

          CUT TO:

          INT. CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Billy drives, while trying to tell a story to Pete.

          THUSIASTIC)
          Lancelot raises Excalibur and...
          Wham! He knocks the Black Knight
          down ! Then with-another swing...
          Wham! He finishes him off!

          PETE
          (impressed by
          Billy's storytelling)
          Wow...
          Billy digs into his pocket and gives Pete the copy of
          "Once And Future King".

          BILLY
          Here. You can borrow it.
          Pete takes the book.

          PETE
          Hey, Billy...You know so much about
          Vikings and stuff...You should
          write one of these stories yourself.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          PETE
          Really?

          BILLY

          Table'. A Trilogy Of Honor.,

          PETE
          Sounds gre t. When can I read it?

          BILLY

          (CHUCKLES)
          I've only got about 70 pages done...
          But as soon as it's published, you'll
          get one of the first copies. Speci-
          ally autographed by the author.
          Pete smiles. Billy makes a turn. He pulls into the parking
          lot of

          DOUGAL'S ANTIQUES
          A huge, three story home, with an antique shop set up on
          the first floor.
          Billy and Pete get out of the car and enter the store.

          DORRY DOUGAL
          the 64 year old storekeeper, stands behind the counter.
          Dorry is husky, bald on top, with thick patches of red hair
          on his temples. A huge, red moustache sits beneath his
          bulbous nose. His arms are thick, hairy. A strong Irish-
          man.

          DORRY
          Good afternoon to you, Billy.

          BILLY
          Hi, Dorry.
          (eyes light)
          Is it ready yet?
          Dorry smiles. He reaches to a shelf behind the counter.
          He removes ,a long object, wrapped in a piece of green cloth.
          He rests it on the counter.

          

          

          

          

          15
          Billy watches with.wide eyes. Pete is curious.
          Dorry slowly unwraps the object. Inside the cloth, is a
          long silver sword, with a gleaming blade and an engraved
          steel.holster.. - Pete is impressed..

          DORRY
          (to Pete)
          It's an authentic replica of an
          Eleventh Century sword.
          Billy's eyes examine every inch of the sword. It's
          beautiful.

          DORRY
          I got most of the rust off...But
          there were a couple spots that
          wouldn't budge.
          Billy runs his finger along the blade.

          DORRY
          Careful. It's sharp.
          A big smile covers Billy's face.- He's in love with the
          sword.

          BILLY
          What do I owe you?

          DORRY
          Two hundred. You can pay me twenty
          a week.
          Billy pulls a twenty from his wallet and pays Dorry.
          Billy carefully wraps the sword and puts it under his
          arm.

          BILLY
          Thanks, Dorry.

          DORRY
          My pleasure, son.
          Billy and Pete exit the store.

          blends in with the others. But it's a little nicer,
          better kept. A row of colored lights is draped across
          the snowy shrubbery.
          Billy's Pinto pulls into the drive. He gets out, sword
          under his arm. He enters the house.

          A small hallway, leading to a stairway.

          BARNEY

          She hears Billy enter. She quickly pops a valium from
          a small pill bottle. She calls to her son.

          LYNN
          Billy? Is the'.t you honey?

          BILLY

          Billy enters. He rests the sword on his bed. He unwraps
          it. He picks up the sword.
          He turns to the mirror and poses with the sword. He holds
          it at a few differentangles, trying to decide which looks
          best for him.
          He takes a few swings with the sword.
          He stops and smiles to himself. A real warrior.

          Billy sits at the table, eating dinner with Lynn.

          LYNN
          How was work?

          BILLY
          Okay.

          LYNN
          Have you asked that Tracy girl
          out yet?

          LYNN
          I was just curious.

          Yeah,.well it's none of your
          business.
          Nervous,Lynn popsvalfum with her wine.

          .{ LYNN

          (OFFENDED)
          I guess it's none of my business
          that your clothes are washed and
          ironed, or that you have a hot
          meal on the table...

          BILLY
          No. It isn't. I'm old enough
          to take care of that stuff myself.
          I'm old enough to get a place of
          my own.

          LYNN
          Don't start that again. Your
          Father's coming home tonight.

          BILLY
          Good. I think we should talk
          about it.

          LYNN
          It'll put him in a bad mood.

          BILLY
          No, it'll put you in a bad mood.
          Lynn and Billy exchange a glare. They look down at their
          food.
          A few silent, uncomfortable moments pass.
          Lynn looks back to Billy. She smiles. Time for the
          tender approach. She touches his hand.

          LYNN
          Billy, honey...

          BILLY
          (moves his hand
          from hers)
          Stop calling me 'honey'.

          have to struggle like we did.
          We want to help, until you can

          BILLY
          Bit it's gonna take me another-
          year to finish my novel. . .and what
          if it doesn't get published?

          LYNN
          It'll get published.

          BILLY
          But what if it doesn't? Are you
          gonna take care of me until I'm
          old and grey, working on my 25th
          unpublished novel?...

          LYNN
          If it takes that long, yes.

          BILLY

          (FRUSTRATED)
          Don't you understand?.. .I've got
          to 'leave now! I rve got to try and
          make it on my own now!
          Before Lynn.can reply, A VOICE INTERRUPTS.

          RAND (O . S . )
          Is anybody home?
          Lynn stands and whispers to Billy.

          LYNN
          Please, let's forget about this.
          Just for tonight. Okay?
          Billy pauses. Finally gives in and nods.
          Lynn stands. She pops another valium and exits to greet
          her husband. We hear them, exchange an excited ".hello".
          They kiss and laugh, glad to be in each other's arms.
          Billy just sits. Burning.

          INT. FRONT HALLWAY

          Rand hugs his wife. Barney is jumping up and down, tugging
          at Rand's coat.
          Suitcases rest on the floor.' Beside them, is, Mogwai's
          plastic case.
          Billy enters. Rand sees him.

          RAND

          (SMILES)
          Billy .. ,
          Billy walks to his Father. They embrace.

          BILLY
          (happy to see him)
          Hi, Dad.
          They hold each other for a second. Lynn closes the front
          door. Rand picks up Mogwai's case. Lynn turn's to her
          husband.

          RAND
          (takes Lynn's hand)
          Not now. I've got a surprise for
          both of you. Come on.
          He leads them into the living room. Lynn and. Billy exchange
          a puzzled glance. They follow Rand.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Rand dims the lights. He motions for Billy and Lynn to
          sit on the sofa. They do. Barney sits on Billy's lap.
          Rand sits in front of them, on a leather easy chair. He
          rests Mogwai's case on his lap. He opens the case.
          Mogwai leaps out, onto the coffee table.
          Lynn and'Bill are startled. They stare at the creature in
          wonderment.
          Barney hates it. He growls at Mogwai.

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Rand lights a cigarette. He turns to Mogwai and claps
          his hands. The creature picks up an ash tray and carries
          it to Rand. Mogwai hops onto Rand's lap.
          Lynn and Billy are amazed...

          BILLY
          (staring at Mogwai)
          What is it? A.monkey? A rat?.

          RAND
          Your new pet.

          BILLY

          (UNCERTAIN)
          Mj Oh, yeah?...
          Mogwai starts to sing, humming in that unearthly falsetto.

          BILLY
          What's that?

          RAND
          He's singing.

          BILLY
          Sounds kind of creepy.
          Barney still growls.

          RAND
          Barney! Be a good dog and go up-
          stairs!
          Barney reluctantly hops off Billy's lap and exits.
          Lynn stares at Mogwai.

          LYNN
          I think he's just darling.
          Mogwai.
          Rand holds the creature out to Billy.

          C'mon. He won't bite.
          Billy forces himself to take the creature. Mogwai nestles
          close to Billy. Rand smiles at his son.

          RAND
          He likes you.
          Billy looks nauseous. Lynn stands.

          LYNN
          You two look so cute together.
          I have to take a picture.
          Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a
          Kodak Instamatic.
          Mogwai is on Billy's shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy
          hates it.

          RAND -
          I want you to take good care
          of him.
          Lynn focuses the camera on Billy and Mogwai.

          LYNN
          Okay smile.
          Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still licks his cheek.
          Lynn snaps the picture. Flash!
          Mogwai lets out a high scream. Frightened of the bright
          light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally scratching Billy's
          cheek.

          BILLY
          Little bastard.
          Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature,
          comforting it

          reason to get upset. The little
          fellow's scared. He hates bright
          light..
          Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on
          his face. He looks -at t em.
          There's blood on hisï¿½4ingertips.
          Billy looks at Mogwai.

          Above Billy., The creature begins to sing.
          Billy tries to ignore Mogwai's singing. No good. It gets
          on his nerves. Billy slams his hand on the desk top. He
          glares at the creature.

          BILLY
          Shut up.
          Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing.
          Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct
          light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles
          up to Billy's arm. He jumps back.

          BILLY
          Get off of me.
          Mogwai just looks at him.

          Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It
          sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's
          too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the
          floor.
          Billy turns.
          Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened.
          Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.

          BILLY
          (angry, to Mogwai)
          You stupid little...
          Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill
          the tiny creature.
          Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It
          is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery.
          Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and
          picks up the.creature.

          BILLY

          I'm sorry.. .just try to be more

          What's in there?
          Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto

          PETE
          What is it?

          BILLY
          A present from my Dad.
          Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.

          PETE
          It's neat.
          Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops
          from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie
          and starts to eat.

          PETE
          C'mon...My Mom will never know.
          I'll hide it under my bed.
          Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily
          knocks over the water bottle.
          A few drops of water splash Mogwai.
          The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched
          scream.
          Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared.
          Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with
          water begin to bubble... .expand...'
          Billy can't believe his eyes.
          Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more,
          getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode.
          Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated.
          The spots burst.

          FOUR NEW CREATURES
          popout. Clones of Mogwai.
          The spots on Mogwai's body bond together and disappear, as
          if they were never there.
          There are now five identical creatures on the desktop.
          Billy and Pete share a shocked glance.
          Billy grabs the water bottle. He has to be certain that
          he wasn't halucinating. He splashes a little more water
          on one of the new creatures.
          The process begins again. The creature's body,contorts.
          A few lumps form. The lumps expand until...they burst.

          new world.
          Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk

          BILLY
          (still dazed)
          Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so.
          Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group.
          It cries out. In a high, piercing scream.
          The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature
          and bring it back to their group.

          PETE

          (SCARED)
          Maybe I won't take one.
          The creatures have moved to the brownies. They rip the
          brownies to pieces, devouring them. They're giggling.

          Clawing. Screeching.

          PETE
          Yeah...that's what happened when
          I tried to take one.

          If one is separated. The others

          Distant sounds are heard. Animal-like noises. Gurgling.
          Slurping. Chewing.
          Billy wakes. He sits up in bed. The sounds continue.
          He looks around the room.
          The creatures are gone.
          Billy notices his room door.

          He gets out of bed. He looks at his sword, hanging above
          the bed. He takes the sword from the wall. He walks out
          of the.room.

          Billy walks. Sword in hand.
          The noises get louder. Crisper. Clearer.
          Nervous, Billy descends the dark stairs. He arrives at

          The sounds are coming from the living room.

          Billy enters. He looks to the floor. Beneath the'Christmas
          tree.
          The creatures surround Barney.
          They have killed the dog.
          Billy tries to move. He's frozen.
          The creatures are eating the dog.
          They look up at Billy.
          Their bright green eyes are fiery.
          Blood covers their mouths.
          They smile.

           The tr p door opens. Billy and Rand climb inside. They
           .both carry flashlights.
          They s ine the lights through the attic, looking for the
          creatu es. They see nothing.
           Billy spots something. He nudges his Father.
           There are NINE INDIVIDUAL PODS, stuck to various places-on
          the floor. The pods are 16 inches long, 12 inches in dia-
           meter. They are wrapped with a vein-like wire and covered
          with a thick, syrupy glaze.

          RAND
          What in the hell?...
          Billy picks up a broomstick andl pokes one of the things.
          Won't budge. Hard as a rock.

          BILLY
          Damn things are stuck to the
          floor.
          Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head
          and swings down, hard. Against the pod.
          The bat snaps in two.
          The pod is unblemished.
          Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look
          at each other. Puzzled.

          Exactly. Those things in the
          attic-are cocoons. Inside,. the
          creatures are going through some
          sort of change...a metamorphosis.

          BILLY
          Why did they attack my dog?

          ROY
          Simple. They're animals. They
          were hungry. Aside from water,
          food is their main concern.

          RAND
          How long until they hatch?

          Billy, don't be hasty...You've
          stumbled onto a new life form.
          What comes out of those cocoons
          could be a major scientific
          discovery...

          Now what do we do?

          RAND
          I get back from Seattle on
          Wednesday. I'll call some con-
          struction people. They'll come
          in next week and cut these things
          out of the floor.

          BILLY
          I don't think we should wait. Let's
          do it ourselves.

          RAND
          No. It's late. I've got an early
          plane to catch.

          Something leaps out and grabs Lynn by the throat.
          A creature. We can't see it clearly. - It moves too fast.
          It is hiddenby the shadows.
          Other dark figures come at Lynn. More creatures. They
          want their share of the food.
          Lynn watches in horror as the creatures surround her head.
          She screams.

          EXT. ATTIC

          Lynn's body jumps and twists. Her feet kick as she is
          pulled up into the attic.
          There are a few seconds of silence.
          Then we hear the sounds.
          Chewing. Swallowing. Giggling.

          BILLY
          sprints down his driveway.
          He arrives at the porch of his home.
          He opens the front door.

          Scattered giggling echoes from inside.
          Billy flips on the'front hall..light..
          A few tiny shadows scatter. They dash into other rooms.
          Afraid of the light.
          Billy'slowly enters. He's scared.
          He looks to the top of the stairs.

          BILLY
          Mom?...
          More giggling.
          Shaking'. Nervous. Billy climbs the stairs.
          At the top, he quickly flips on the bright hall light.
          Something darts up into the darkness of the attic. Escap-
          ing the light.
          Billy spots the open attic door.
          He walks beneath it.
          He looks up into the dark attic.

          BILLY.
          (shaking voice)
          Mom?...

          AN OBJECT
          is thrown out of the attic. It lands at Billy's feet.
          He jumps back. He looks at the object.

          LYNN'S VALIUM BOTTLE
          Stained with her blood.
          Billy picks it up.
          A giggle from the attic.

           He clutches the sword.
           He takes a deep breath and flips out the hall light.
           Darkness.
          Billy waits. A few seconds pass.

          A CREATURE
          leaps from the attic, into the hallway.
          Billy jumps back.
          Mogwai snarls at him.
          Mogwai has changed.
          It stands two feet tall.
          The brown fur is gone, replaced by rock hard, rippled armor.
          The arms and legs are muscular, covered with the same armor.
          The paws have been replaced by claws. The fingernails are
          sharp.
          The tail is long and pointed. Reptilian. It thrashes
          back and forth.
          Sharp white horns have replaced the ears.
          The green eyes are larger. They bulge. Evil. Angry.
          A:huge mouth distorts the face with its wide grin. The
          countless teeth are long and sharp. Gleaming white. Fresh
          blood drips from them.
          The giggle remains, undercut with a hungry animalistic growl

          INSIDE
          Billy sees Lynn's body. She lies on the floor. Dead.
          Billy walks to her.
          Lynn is covered with bites and scratches.
          Billy looks away. Angry. Saddened.
          He notices the cocoons. All hatched.
          Sounds echo from downstairs. Thumps. Giggles.
          Billy's face goes white with fear. There's more.
          He dashes out of the attic.

          UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
          Billy walks slowly. Clutching his sword. Ready for an
          attack.
          He descends the stairs.

          A CREATURE
          leaps from the overhead chandelier. It lands on Billy's
          back.
          The creature tries to bite Billy's neck.
          Billy slams his blade 'nto Mogwai. He whacks the creature.
          Again and again.
          Finally, Mogwai falls to the floor.
          Billy brings down his blade. Hard.
          It slices Mogwai's head off. The creature's body quivers.
          It dies.
          Billy moves to the living room.

          LIVING ROOM
          Dimly lit. The fireplace burns. The Christmas tree lights
          flash.
          Billy enters.

          AN OBJECT
          flies at Billy from across the room. He ducks.
          A DINNER PLATE smashes against the wall behind him.
          Billy looks to the

          CHINA CABINET.
          A CREATURE sits on the middle shelf. Giggling. It throws
          another plate at-Billy.
          He bats the plate away with his sword.
          Mogwai continues to throw plates at him.
          Billy dodges the plates, making his way to the China Cabinet.
          There, he lunges forward with his sword. Bullseye. Mogwai
          is stabbed. Straight through the chest.

          The creature screams, writhing in pain. It falls from the
          China shelf to the floor. Dead.
          Billy slowly moves across the room. His eyes dart back
          and forth, looking for creatures.'
          He walks by the fireplace.
          Three large RED VELVET STOCKINGS hang from the mantle.
          Each one is inscribed with a name: BILLY, RAND and LYNN.

          A-CREATURE
          pops out of each stocking. Growling. Snarling.
          Startled, Billy jumps back.
          The three creatures hop to the floor and move towards

          BILLY:
          He clutches his sword. Tight.
          Two creatures leap at him.
          He spears one in mid-air.
          He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the
          ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists
          the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood.
          The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg.
          It takes a bite from his calf.
          Billy cries out in pair.
          Mogwai stays on. Biting hard.
          Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace.
          Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go.
          Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring
          flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to
          a crisp.
          Billy removes his steaming sword.
          The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead.
          Billy checks his leg. A small bite.
          He walks to the kitchen.

          Billy stands quietly!'in the doorway.

          TWO CREATURES
          are inside. They don't notice Billy.
          One has crawled into the large blender. It laps up the
          left over white icing.
          The other sits on the table. It nibbles on the Santa cookies.
          Billy looks at the bl!ende1r. It's' unplugged.
          Billy moves quickly. He dashes across the room and plugs
          in the blender. It starts with'a loud whirr.
          The startled creature spins inside.. Mogwai's screams
          die as it is chopped into a green mush.
          The remaining creature growls at Billy.
          Billy lunges forward with his sword.
          Mogwai leaps out of the way, onto the kitchen cabinet.
          Billy turns to the creature.
          Mogwai stands in front of the open microwave oven.
          Billy pokes at the creature with his sword.
          Mogwai takes a few steps back.
          Billy still pokes at Mogwai, forcing the creature into
          the oven.
          Billy quickly closes theoven door.
          Mogwai is trapped inside.

          Billy flips the oven switch to "bake". The microwave

          Inside, Mogwai screams and pounds against the glass door.
          Soon, the creature falls.' Its body quivers. The armor-,.
          like skin bubbles and pops. Mogwai boils to death.
          Bill wipes the swea from hs brow and exits the kitchen.

          LIVING ROOM
          Billy enters. He looks at the dead creatures. He sighs.
          Relieved. They're all gone.
          Billy rests his sword against the wall. He picks up the
          telephone and dials "0".

          BILLY
          Yes, could you connect me with
          the Sheriff's Office?...

          A SWIFT SHADOW
          moves across the floor, behind Billy.

          BILLY
          Hello? ...Is this Sheriff Lucia?...

          A CLAW
          tears the phone cord from the wall.

          Billy turns. Face to face with Mogwai.
          Billy glances to his sword. A few feet away. Against
          the wall.
          Mogwai takes a step closer.
          Billy reaches for the sword.
          The creature leaps and lands on Billy's chest, knocking
          him to the floor. {
          .Billy wrestles with the creature. He tries to grab the
          sword, but Mogwai is clawing and biting at him.
          Billy's hand finally reaches the sword. He snatches it.
          He brings down the blade, into the creature's arm.
          Mogwai jumps back. Wounded.
          Billy stands. He raises his sword to finish off the creature.
          Mogwai dodges theblade, jumping to the window ledge.
          Billy moves toward the creature.
          Mogwai smashes through'the window, escaping into the night.
          Billy hurries out of the house.

          OUTSIDE
          The blizzard is starting up.
          Billy arrives at the broken window. He looks to the ground
          and sees

          MOGWAI'S FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW
          They stretch across the backyards of suburbia, disappearing
          into the darkness.
          Following the footprints, Billy runs after the creature.
          a cute, blonde-haired, blue-eyed 8 year old
          backyard. She is building A snowman.

          Before Peggy can scream, Mogwai grabs her.
          The creature pulls Peggy inside the snowman.
          Peggy puts up afight. But she isn't strong enough. Her
          little feet kick as she is pulled inside of the snowman.

          BILLY(
          arrives in Peggy's backyard. He sees the young girl's
          legs kicking from the snowman's torso.
          Billy rushes over. He grabs Peggy's legs. A tug of war.
          Billy pulls Peggy out of the snowman.

          Billy quickly attacks the snowman with his sword.
          He swings and swings until "Skippy" is nothing but a pile
          of snow.
          But there is no sign of Mogwai.
          Billy spots footprints leading away from the snowman.
          Mogwai has escaped.
          Billy runs after the footprints.
          Peggy watches him disappear around the corner of the house.
          Peggy's Mother opens the door. She is puzzled by the pile of

          He opens the window and climbs inside.

          Divided into two sections. One side: A basketball court.
          The other: A swimming pool.
          It's dark. Billy enters.

          TWO GREEN EYES BURN
          from the far side of the gym.- Mogwai sits at the top of
          the stacked bleachers.
          Billy doesn't see the creature. He shines his flashlight
          across the gym floor.

          BILLY

          The flashlight stops on the gymnasium light box. The box

          A BASKETBALL
          rolls to a stop at Billy's feet.
          Mogwai's giggle echoes through the gymnasium.
          Billy looks into the vast darkness.

          BILLY
          Colme on out...you bastard...
          It is silent again. Billy is frightened. He walks
          faster, moving to the light box.
          Billy hears another sound. He shines the light to another
          area.
          Again. Nothing.
          Billy starts to tremble. He runs to the light box.
          gets there and quickly flips open the box.
          Billy drops the flashlight and sword.
          The creature's sharp fingernails clutch onto Billy's chest.
          Billy falls backward, with Mogwai holding onto him.
          They tumble into the swimming pool. The deep end.

          THE. WATER
          Billy separates himself from the creature. He swims to the
          side of the pool and gets out.
          He runs and picks up his sword. He looks at the scratches
          on his chest. They bleed. But he'll live.

          SUDDENLY
          A small rumbling sound echoes from
          Billy locks to the pool.
          The water is moving. Bubbling. Rippling
          Billy is scared. He runs to the exit doorway.
          The rumblinggets.louder. The pool's water gets
          violent.

          It is followed by anoth'r creature.
          They are followed by three more.
          Then five more. Eight more. Ten more.
          They keep coming. In droves.

          BILLY
          watches from the doorway.

          BILLY

          (SHOCK)
          Oh my God.

          HUNDREDS OF CREATURES
          are now coming out of the pool.- The huge amount of water
          forces them to multiply at an-incredibly fast rate.

          have a very active imagination. My

          My Mother is dead. So is my friend.
          I am not imagining things.
          Billy glares at Frank. The Sheriff sighs. He looks at
          Officer Brent.

          BILLY
          They're inside.
          Brent checks his pistol. It's loaded.

          BILLY

          walks to the building's front door. Locked. He smiles.
          He takes astep back, draws his gun and shoots off the

          Pistol drawn, Brent walks down the hallway, to the gym
          doors.
          He can hear the sounds from inside. Gurgling. Breathing.
          Giggling.
          He takes a drink from his hip flask. He enters the gym.

          INSIDE
          Brent is shocked by what he sees.

          HUNDREDS OF PAIRS OF BURNING GREEN EYES
          fill the gymnasium, shining in the darkness. Like a
          starry night.

          DROVES OF MOGWAI
          are still coming out of the swimming pool.
          Brent is frozen. He tries to scream.
          The creatures notice him. Several move towards him.
          Brent fires his pistol. Useless. There are too many
          creatures.

          BILLY
          He hears the gunshots. He moves faster, desperately
          hacking at the handcuff chain with his sword.

          They feast.

          Sweating. Nervous. Hacking away at the handcuff chain.
          Brent's screams fade in the background.

          THE Y.M.C.A.'S FRONT DOORS BURST OPEN
          Droves of creatures pour out into the night.

          BILLY
          panics. He hacks at the chain. Harder. Faster.

          THE CREATURES
          move toward the police car.

          BILLY
          finally breaks the handcuff chain. He quickly moves to
          the driver's seat and starts the car.

          The car screeches to a stop. Billy gets out. Sword in

          knocks. Hard.

          ,No, it's this Peltzer kid. He
          thinks we're gonna get: eaten up
          by wild animals. And he's
          carrying a sword.

          MR. DEAGLE
          Did you say 'Peltzer'? Billy
          Peltzer?

          1 Yeah...

          MR. DEAGLE

          He's a nut. Went crazy in the

          Billy just stands there. Defeated. Frustrated.

          A CREATURE
          hisses. Behind Billy.
          Billy turns. Mogwai leaps at him.
          Billy raises his sword and swings.
          He knocks the creature down. He stabs Mogwai.
          Mogwai dies with a long scream.
          Billy looks up and sees

          THE PACK OF CREATURES
          moving down Main Street. They have arrived. Looking for
          food.
          Many break into the house across the street. There are

          Billy slams the car door. It severs the creature4si-rand..
          Several creatures surround the car.

          Officer-Brent?.

          BILLY (V.0.)
          He was kiljed by.ithe creatures.
          What? Whe

          THE POLï¿½CE C AR
          is blanketed by creatures, trying to get in at Billy.
          Billy screams into the radio mike.

          BILLY
          (panic, screaming
          into the radio mike)
          The creatures are all over town...
          breaking into houses... killing
          people... You've got to get help!...

          THE READ WINDOW SMASHES.
          The creatures start to rip away at the glass.
          A creature's arm smashes through the passenger window.
          Billy drops the radio mike.

          SHERIFF (V.0.)
          Peltzer?!?...Peltzer?!?...
          Billy thinks fast. He flips on the siren and flashing
          roof lights.

          THE CREATURES
          are scared of the bright lights. They scatter away from
          she car.

          BILLY
          starts the engine. He squeals out of the driveway.

          (SMILING)
          Sounds like he really flipped
          out this time.
          Frank stands. He straps on his gun holster.

          FRANK
          Looks like I'm gonna have to
          straighten this out myself. Want
          to go for a ride?

          GARY
          (eyes light)
          Can I drive?
          Frank. reluctantly nods. Gary stands.

          GARY

          (SARCASTIC)
          But, Frank...With everybody out...
          Who's gonna be here to answer the
          Emergency phone calls?

          (FALSETTO)
          'Help! The little gremlins are
          eating my baby!'
          Gary laughs hard at his joke. They exit the police station.

          CAMERA STAYS BEHIND
          in the deserted police station. We hear Frank and Gary get
          into the car and drive off.

          THEN
          A telephone rings. And another phone rings. And.another.
          People need help.

          BILLY
          Shaky. Nervous. Behind the wheel of the police car.

          OUTSIDE
          The creatures are making their way down M in Street.
          They are everywhere.
          On rooftops. Front lawns. Smashing through windows.
          Breaking into homes.
          Scattered human screams echo through the night.
          People are dying.
          Mogwai is taking over the. town'.

          BILLY
          looks through his windshield. Up ahead, he sees

          TRACY
          screaming for help, from a third floor window of her home.

          BILLY
          steers the police car into her driveway. He squeals to
          a stop.
          He grabs his sword and gets out of the car.

          OUTSIDE
          Billy runs to below Tracy's window. He shouts to her.

          BILLY
          Tracy!...It's me! Billy!

          TRACY
          stands in her bedroom. The bedroom door is closed. Locked.
          The creatures pound against it.. They want in.

          

          

          

          

          77
          Tracy shouts down to Billy.

          TRACY
          Billy! These things are all over
          my house... I'm trapped!
          (a beat) 1
           There's a ladder beside the garage...
          Billy runs to the garage side. e reaches down and picks
          up a rusty aluminum ladd r.

          I
          He puts the ladder up to Tracy's window and climbs to her.

          INT. TRACY'S ROOM


          THE BEDROOM DOOR BURSTS OPEN.
          Two creatures stand there Growling. 'Hungry. They,
          move to Tracy.
          She screams.
          Billy gets to Tracy. He quickly pulls her out of the
          window. They begin to climb down the ladder.

          ON THE GROUND BELOW
          a creature jumps onto the ladder.
          Tracy. is startled. She nearly falls. Billy grabs. a. better
          hold of her. He drops his sword. It falls to the ground
          and lands in the snow.
          The creature looks up and sees Billy and Tracy. A few
          feet above. Mogwai begins to climb the ladder, going
          after them.
          Billy and Tracy start to climb up the ladder.
          But the two other creatures come out of Tracy'.s bedroom
          window. They see Billy and Tracy below. They climb oft
          after them, down the ladder.
          Billy and Tracy are trapped. Sandwiched between the
          creatures.
          Billy looks to his sword on the ground. So far away.

          

          

          

          

          REV. 4/30/82 78
          Thinking fast, Billy pulls the ladder back.
          It sways. He pulls harder.
          The ladder tilts to the ground. Falling.
          The three creatures are thrown to the ground, into the
          deep snow.
          Billy and Tracy ride the ladder down. The snow breaks
          their fall.
          The creatures dig their way out of the snow. They move
          towards Billy and Tracy.
          Billy snaps up his sword and jumps to his feet. Ready
          to fight. He keeps one protective arm around Tracy.
          The creatures surround them. Waiting for the right moment
          to attack.
          One of the creatures moves forward.
          Another leaps behind Billy.
          Billy lunges forward and spears the first creature.
          He quickly reels around, slicing the other creature in
          two.
          Both creatures lie in the snow. Dead.
          Billy turns to the last Mogwai. With two swings of his
          blade, he kills the creature.
          Billy wipes the green blood off his sword with his coat
          sleeve. Breathless, he looks at Tracy .
          Hair .hangs in his eyes. Blood runs down the side of his.
          sweaty, unshaven face. His dark brown eyes stare at Tracy.
          The transformation from meek bank clerk to sexy hero is
          complete.
          He embraces her. They run to the police car and get inside.
          Billy'starts the car. He and Tracy drive off into the
          night.

          Gary drives. Frank sits beside him. Gary flips on the siren
          and lights. He smiles. Like a little kid. Frank reaches
          over and.turns off the siren. Gary complains.

          GARY

          But this is an emergency. We
          gotta warn everybody! The gremlins
          are coming!
          Gary laughs. Frank sighs

          GARY
          So when are you gonna make me
          Deputy?

          FRANK
          When you grow up.

          GARY
          Why don't you fire Brent. He's
          nothin' but a drunk. I'could do
          a lot better.
          They arrive at the outskirts of town. Frank notices some-
          thing up ahead.
          He can see the shadows of the creatures. Crawling on
          houses. Running across the front lawns.
          Frank motions for Gary to slow down.

          FRANK
          Something looks weird.
          (rolls Jown. his

          He sticks his head out the window to look out.

          A CREATURE
          leaps onto the car's passenger' side. The creature grabs
          Frank' arm. He tries to shake off the creature.
          Gary gl nce over. Shocked. Horrified.
          Mogwai takes a huge bite out of Frank's arm. He screams.
          Gary turns to help him.

          THE POLICE-CAR
          slides on the ice. It slams-into a guard rail, flips over
          a ditch and spins to a stop.

          CUT TO:

          BILLY'S CAR
          Billy drives, as fast as possible through the heavy snow.
          He's headed out of town. Tracy sits beside him. She
          looks out the window..

          OUTSIDE
          The rows of once peaceful, cheerful homes are now the
          scenes of frenzied horror.
          People run out into the night, screaming for help, only
          to be dragged to the ground by creatures.
          Ravaged bodies lie in the snow. Frozen.
          An ambulance is overturned on the roadside.
          Phone lines are town down.
          The creatures have made their way across town. They now
          attack the last few houseson the block.

          Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out.

          OUTSIDE
          He closes the door. Tracy is safe inside.
          Billy walks to the.sheriff's car. He stays in the safety
          of the headlight's beam.
          Billy stops a few feet from the sheriff's car.
          The passenger side is crushed. The driver's side is
          barely damaged, save for a dented, jammed door.
          Gary pounds against-the door. He wants out.
          Billy grabs the car handle. He pulls hard. The door
          pops open. He pulls Gary out.
          Gary gets to his feet. He's okay. Billy looks inside
          the car.
          Billy closes the door.

          BILLY
          C'mon. Just stay in the light.
          They're afraid of the light.

          Billy hops into the driver's seat. He rests the sword
          beside him.--He--starts the car and continues to drive.,
          Gary gives Tracy another kiss. He needs her comfort.
          Billy just stares ahead, at the snowy road.

          CUT TO:

          DOUGAL'S ANTIQUE STORE - ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN
          Closed.. But the upstairs lights are on. Someone is
          home.
          Everything here looks calm. Untouched. Safe.
          The police car pulls into the driveway.

          INSIDE
          Billy turns to Gary and Tracy.

          BILLY
          We're just outside of town...
          Doesn't look like the creature's
          got here yet.
          (a beat)
          Let's go inside and warm up.
          They exit the police car.

          DORRY
          comes to the door. He sees the worn, hollow faces of Gary
          and Tracy. He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy.

          Dorry bandages Billy's calf. Gary sits with Tracy on
          the sofa.
          Billy finishes telling the full story to everyone.

          BILLY
          .and they originate from this
          marketplace in Hong Kong.
          Dorrystands and shakes his head.

          DORRY
          Hard to believe. Like Satan's
          come to walk the earth.

          BILLY
          (looks at everyone)
          You see...they''re drawn to water.
          Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll
          be leaving town, and heading for the
          water tower-which means they'll have
          to pass by here tonight.
          (a beat)
          We have to get help. These things
          have to be kept under control. If
          they get to the water tower .they
           could spread all over the St ate...
          maybe the Country. They're like
          inhuman divining rods.

          GARY
          Why didn't you think of that before,
          Peltzer?

          BILLY
          I did. But nobody would listen.

          GARY .
          Maybe if you weren't such a nut
          people would believe you.

          anywhere.
          Gary still glares at Billy.

          GARY
          This is your fau t, Peltzer.

          BILLY
          That's not true.

          My brother's dead because of

          The people in town. They're

          (ANGRY)
          Stop it.

          GARY
          You did it. You killed all
          those people.. You're. a murderer,
          Peltzer.
          Billy lunges at Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting.
          Dorry and Tracy break it up.

          TRACY
          If we want to stay . alive... We
          have to stick together.
          Billy turns away. Cooling off.
          Gary is comforted by Tracy. But she keeps her eye on
          Billy. Dorry looks at everyone.

          DORRY
          We should get in touch with
          the authorities.

          Gary's cigarette lighter illuminates the room. Everyone
          stays quiet. They listen.
          THE GIGGLING of several creatures echoes from outside.

          BILLY
          They're here.
          A frightened Gary holds Tracy.

          GARY
          Now what do we do?
          The giggling gets louder. Closer. Billy turns to Dorry.

          BILLY
          Do you have a place without win
          dows?... .A place where we could be
          safe?
          Dorry pauses to think.

          Dorry sits beside them in anï¿½old rocking chair.
          Billy pulls up an old wooden'chair.

          LOUD NOISES, CRASHES. BANGS, THUMPS, GIGGLES..
          They echo from OFFSCREEN. The creatures rummage through
          the antique store.

          CLOSE-UP - BILLY, GARY, TRACY, DORRY
          listening to the sounds. Frightened.

          DORRY
          Mischevious little devils,
          aren't they?
          No one disagrees.
          Tracy suddenly notices something. She cries out.

          Thinking fast, Billy moves to a large cabinet. He
          turns to Gary.

          I've only been this scared two
          other times in my life. Once
          was when I got drafted. The
          other, was when I was six years
          old.
          (everyone listens)
          It.was Christmas Eve. My sisters
          and I were decorating the tree
          with our Mother. We were singing
          caroles...happy ...excited...
          waiting for Dad to get home from
          work.
          (a beat)
          A few hours passed, and we started
          to worry. Dad wasn't home yet. My
          Mother called the office. They said
          he left.

          (PAUSE)
          After about a week... the police gave
          up. My Mother was close to a nervous
          breakdown... The rest of us weren't
          eating.. .we couldn't sleep.. .Every-
          thing was falling apart.

          (PAUSE)
          It was snowing outside. The house
          was cold. I threw some logs on
          the fire.--..That's when I noticed
          the smell.
          (a beat)
          The firemen came. They broke
          through the chimney top. We were
          all waiting, expecting them to
          pull out some dead cat or bird...
          Instead, they pulled out my Father.

          (PAUSE)
          He was dressed in a Santa Claus
          suit. He had been climbing down
          the chimney on Christmas Eve,
          his arms loaded with presents.

          DORRY (CONT'D)
          He was going to surprise us.

          (PAUSE)
          The coroner said that he lost
          his footing. He slipped and
          broke his neck. Died instantly.
          His body was lodged in the narrow
          chimney shaft.

          (PAUSE)
          ,That how I found out there was
          no Sahta Claus.
          Everyone has a chilled look on their faces. Dorry just
          stares.
          Billy stands and clears his throat..

          BILLY
          Well...I think you should all
          try and get some sleep.
          (a beat)
          I'll watch the door.
          Everyone agrees. Billy moves his chair in front of the
          door.
          .Dorry relaxes.inhis rocking chair.
          Gary stretches out on the sofa, expecting Tracy to cuddle
          with him. Instead,"she walks:over to Billy.

          TRACY
          Billy...
          He looks at her. She gives him a comforting smile.

          TRACY
          I just wanted to say thanks...
          I mean...If it wasn't for you, I
          don't know what any of us would
          have done.
          Billy smiles.

          TRACY
          is it okay if I sleep here? On
          the floor beside you?...I'd feel
          a lot safer.
          Billy nods. Tracy moves a carpet next to Billy's chair.
          She lies on the carpet. She closes her eyes.
          Gary watches from the sofa. Jealous.

          

          

          

          
          Dorry has fallen asleep in his chair.
          Billy sits. Sword on his lap. He guards the door.
          Sounds still echo-from downstairâ¢s,.throughout the antique
          store.

          CLOSE-UP - BILLY
          The horror of it all finally hits him.
          His eyes fill with tears.
          He cries. Alone.

          FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

          sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds the sword on
          his lap.
          The others are asleep.
          Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He
          wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword.
          Everyone else wakes from the sound.

          BILLY
          (looking at their
          scared faces)
          Everything's okay...I just
          dropped my sword.

          Tracy folds her arms.

          The police car is parked outside. Many of the restaurant
          windows are broken. A few deserted cars are in the parking
          lot.

          INSIDE
          The creatures have been here.
          The dead body of an old man is slumped across a table.
          A half eaten Big Mac is still in his hand.
          In a booth, sits a dead family: Mother, Father, boy and
          girl. Their food still sits-in front of them. Untouched.
          A dead cashier girl lies on the counter.

          BILLY, TRACY, GARY AND DORRY
          sit at a table in the rear of the restaurant. Away from
          the grisly sights.-
          They eat burgers and fries. Gary takes a bite of his
          burger and nods to Billy.

          It's.possible. But it's more
          important to get at the creatures.
          We've got the advantage now. It's
          daylight.

          GARY I
          You know where they are, Peltzer?

          BILLY
          No...But they're all gathered in
          one place. And the sun rose before
          they could make it to the water
          tower. So they must be holed up
          between here and there.

          Okay...just remember;.We've got
          to stick together. And keep close

          of the light.
          Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight.

          Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the
          two shirts together. He winds them into a cord.
          He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to
          pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds

          The CLANG of Billy's sword hitting the pipe is heard.
          Several of the creatures group together. They move from

          Billy gives one final hit to. the gas line. The connection
          snaps. He stuffs the line with his and Gary's shirt. He
          turns the gas back on and lights the end of the crumpled.
          shirt with a match. The flame slowly creeps up the shirt,
          to the line.

          Gary points to a rear exit.

          That leads outside.

          SEVERAL CREATURES

          Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight.

          ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching.
          Tearing.
          Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures
          off Dorry.
          Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick
          lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai.
          Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some
          of the Mogwai at bay.
          Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas
          line.
          Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry.
          More creatures come through the door.
          Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs

          He stands across the street from the theater. Watching.

          BILLY AND TRACY
          emerge from behind the building. They walk towards Gary.
          Billy walks up. He's holding Dorry's body. He lowers
          the body-to the ground. He glares at Gary.

          BILLY
          You bastard. You ran out on us.
          Left us alone. To die.
          Billy drops his sword and jumps Gary. They fall to the

          Gary knees Billy in the groin. Billy is bent over,
          catching his wind.
          Gary snatches the sword. He lunges at Billy with the
          blade.

          TRACY
          Gary! ...No!...
          Billy dodges the bladï¿½.
          Gary moves closer to Billy. The sword is inches away
          from Billy's chest.
          Gary swings. Billy steps back. The tip of the sword
          scratches across his chest.
          Tracy cries out.
          Gary lunges at him again. Billy is scratched across the

          Billy is backed against,a building wall.
          Gary pulls back his sword, ready to spear Billy..

          A CREATURE
          leaps out of the darkness and grabs Gary by the throat.
          Gary screams. He drops the sword.
          Another creature attacks Gary. Followed by another.
          And another.
          They bring him to the ground. They eat. He dies.
          Billy quickly picks up his sword, before the creatures
          get to hi_m and Tracy. He grabs her hand. They.run to
          the police car.

          Tracy examines Billy's shoulder. A deep cut.

          THE CREATURE ON THE BACK SEAT
          opens its eyes. It lets out a high pitched, wounded cry.
          Tracy picks up the sword, ready to kill the creature.
          Billy stops her.

          BILLY
          Wait...
          He looks out the rear window.

          THE PACK OF CREATURES
          are following the police car.

          BILLY
          looks at the creature on the back seat. It still cries
          out in that high pitched scream.

          BILLY
          (to Tracy)
          Hear that? He's calling his
          friends for help. They're
          following us. As long as
          he's alive and screaming... they'll
          come after him.

          BILLY
          We can't kill him. He's our

          away from the water tower.

          back seat)
          Just keep an eye on the thing...

          Tracy keeps the swo d on the cre ture. Billy guns the

          Billy and Tracy get out. They look tired. Worn. They've
          been driving all night. Billy pumps gas into the car.

          THE WOUNDED CREATURE
          still lies on the back seat. Mogwai still screams in
          its high pitched wail.

          TRACY
          looks into the distance.

          THE PACK OF GREEN EYES

          it and carries the box back to the car.

          BILLY
          grabs the creature. Mogwai is still wounded and dazed.
          But it manages to bite and scratch at Billy.
          Tracy holds the tool box open. Billy forces Mogwai inside.
          He closes the tool box and locks it shut.
          Mogwai is trapped inside. The creature pounds against
          the metal. Its loud cry echoes from inside.
          Billy checks the car's engine.

          BILLY
          Damn! He ripped out the
          coil wires! The car won't
          run without them!

          TRACY

          keep it.
          He walks to his van -and rests the tool box on the front
          passenger seat.

          THE WORKER
          driving home in his van. Later that afternoon. The radio
          plays a Country tune.

          THE TOOL BOX
          rests on the seat beside him.

          SUDDENLY
          the tool box begins to shake. Something pounds against it
          from inside.

          THE WORKER
          pulls his van to the roadside. He stares at the shaking
          tool box. His eyes are wide. Scared.
          The worker grabs the tool box. He gets out of his van.

          OUTSIDE
          The tool box shakes and rattles in the worker's hand.
          Frightened, he throws the box-over a hilly, wooded area
          at the side of the road.

          THE TOOL BOX
          tumbles down a steep hill.
          It lands at the bottom and bounces into a

          LAKE
          The tool box stays afloat for a few seconds. Then it
          slowly sinks into the lake water.

          The tool box sinks to the bottom of the lake.

          1 EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - MORNING 1

          The same crowded Chinatown street where Rand Peltzer first
          found Gizmo the Mogwai. As LOCALS bustle past, ANGLE FAVORS
          the stairs to the basement curiosity shop.

          2 INT. MR. WING'S STORE

          MR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the
          Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day.
          As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs.

          3 EXT. STREET 3

           PEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short.
           ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed
           -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows.
           FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the 
           limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three
           big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car.
           INT. MR. WING'S STORE tj.
           Mr. Wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep
           into the store.

           Mister Wi Daniel Clamp would
           like to see you.

           The men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of
          the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen
          fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New
          York's most successful real estate developer.

          CLAMP (ON TV)
          Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's
          out through to key issues, okay?
          I'm prepared to increase my offer
          substantially.

          (BEAT)
          Now, Mister Wing, you're attached
          to your business. I appreciate
          that. I'm attached to my own
          business. I develop the biggest
          buildings in New York, and you
          sell, ah, little things. Fine.
          But I'm not just talking about
          money here.
          On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel
          beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the
          grandiose of a huge office building,..

          "The Clamp Chinatown Center --
          Where Business Gets Oriented."
          When I put up a building, it's the
          biggest -- it's the newest -- it's
          the best. People are going to be
          killing each other to get into
          this building --
          The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove
          of the store.

           GIZMO (O.S.)
           Tee vee!

           CLAMP (ON TV)
           Now,'we've been able to reach an
           understanding with everyone on the
           block -- except for you. Let me
           show you what I willing to do
           for you -- a s tand and

           Mr. Wing regards the video image impassively. 


           CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.)
           Please IF us know when you've 
          made a decision, Mister Wing. You
          know, I believe that there's
          always an area of agreement that
          two people can reach.
           The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the 
          wereen, replacing Clamp's image.

          MR. WING
          Yes -- a man can always agree with
          others. It is more difficult to
          agree with oneself.

          FORSTER
           Does that mean you -- 
          He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that
          sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he
          answers Forster.

      

          MR. WING
          I'm sorry. Please tell Mister
          Clamp that the answer is no.

          FORSTER
          Keep the TV.
          As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the
          TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to
          change the TV CHANNEL.
          With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE
          from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie

          CAMERA:

          STALLONE

          become war.
          Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an
          arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a
          HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES.

          GIZMO (0.3.)
          Neat!

          But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and
          angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo.

          MR. WING

          18 INT. OFFICE AREA.----''s 18
          The advertising department of Daniel Clamp's empire occupies
          modern, "open-plan" offices -- endless beige partitions form
          tiny CUBICLES full of "ergonomic" furniture. Unseen speakers
          pipe in "WHITE NOISE" -- low-volume static to insulate
          conversations.

          PLANT, and, pinned to the cubicle wall, Billy's DRAWING of the
          main street of Kingston Falls.
          On Billy's drawing board is an illustration of Clamp's

          Marla looks over Billy's shoulder at the drawing.

          He's about to sit down to work, when Daniel Clamp's lieutenant Forster and
          his clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT come down the row of cubicles, looking
          around.

          caged ANIMALS, his attention is captured by a SOUND from the

          scientist, who's on his way in.

          You know, in some parts of the 
          world, there are millions of bats. 
          They could make terrific 
          messengers, like pigeons...

          WALLY 
          That's what we're working on, sir. 
           They arrive at a cage where a resting BAT hangs upside down. An
           intravenous TUBE, sticking out of the bat's flesh, is connected 
          to a drip bottle whose label bears a shining SUN logo.

          But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo
          into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier
          a mess.

          Billy goes through a small anteroom and a second door, into the
          bathroom, where he leans against the door, catching his breath.
          He starts to lift the cover on the cage, then remembers to turn
          the LIGHTS down. He lifts the cover --
          A boy and his Mogwai! EMOTIONS flood over their faces --
          recognition, relief, shared secrets and memories. Billy props
          the cage on a sink, takes Gizmo out.

          BILLY
          Hey, guy...did you miss me?
          Gizmo does EYE MOVEMENTS -- shyly hedging, then admitting it.

          BILLY (CONT.)
          Yeah, me too. Let's put you up
          here. We don't want to get any
          water on you.

           BILLY (CONT.)
          Oh. I'm sorry. But then --
           He stops at a sudden SOUND -- VOICES in the anteroom between the
          bathroom and the hail.

           BILLY (CONT.)
          Quick -- get in here.
           He slips Gizmo into the tool box, above his protesting TWITTERS.

          and the blob of water ROLLS DOWN the illustration board...
          .down the side of the desk...
          Gizmo looks up, but too late. From his POV, the blob of paint-
          tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. It HITS him --
          -- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in
          â¬.g., CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. The
          janitor leaves, and Gizmo SCREAMS, as -- THWIP! THWIP! -- two
          tiny FURBALLS shoot out of his body and land in the open DRAWER
          of a nearby filing cabinet.
          THWIP! The painful Mogwai replication continues, and a third
          furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.
          THWIP! The fourth and final offspring shoots from Gizmo's body,
          and -- as Gizmo watches in horror and pain -- BOUNCES crazily
          around the office area, a little Superball of fur.
          As Gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn
          Mogwai HANDS reach out of the filing cabinet drawer, gripping

          S
          the top edge from inside.

          Mogwais are revealed, standing in the drawer: GEORGE AND LENNY,
          an inseparable pair. Lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while
          George is small, with a criminal caginess -- he gets Lenny to do
          everything for him.
          Gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed
          start to ROCK back and forth -- but is distracted as the
          BOUNCING FURBALL hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets
          up onto a DESKTOP.
          To SOUND FX of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball
          rolls into a desk corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds --
          upside-down. This is DAFFY, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic
          Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate
          with the great Daffy Duck.
          In the first seconds following birth, Daffy goes daffy over the
          very fact of being alive. He sees his little hands and feet
          unfold,. and gives a WHOOP

          Mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach.

          George and Lenny drop down to the carpet to join Mohawk, as
          Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT
          opening low on the wall behind him.
          Lenny grabs Gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in

          Clamp's office is huge, immaculate, and fully outfitted with
          high-tech gadgets. The WINDOW looks down on a bank of CLOUDS
          pierced by the tips of New York LANDMARKS -- the Chrysler
          Building, etc.
          Clamp hits the switch on a desk INTERCOM.

          As he talks, Clamp goes over to a bank of VIDEO MONITORS on his
          wall. Some of them display spy-camera views around the
          building, while others are tuned to Clamp Cable channels. One
          of these catches Clamp's eye: it's showing It's_a Wonderful Life
          in black and white.

           Clamp's SECRETARY pushes the last of his morning's mail into the #

           the Vice President of the United States and starting "Thank you #
           for your generous contribution..." #
          As the letter turns into paper spaghetti, the secretary leaves
          the shredder on, turns to her computer, and starts typing down
          Clamp's dictation. SPOT her prim pink SWEATER hanging on the

          The secretary takes a hurried bite of a SANDWICH, then goes back

          CLAWS of an otherwise O.S. GREMLIN slip a spring-loaded
          MOUSETRAP under the top slice of bread.
          The claws withdraw from sight just as the secretary turns to
          pick up the sandwich again. She takes a bite -- and, though her

          water at Clamp --
          -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him.
          Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the
          empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the
          wall.
          The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his
          face, like a kid panicked by a moth --
          -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is
          caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do

           Gremlin down into the machine --

          GRANDPA FRED
          .tonight we've got a classic
          horror movie, from Grandpa Fred's
          special dungeon --
          Fred is interrupted by a MOAN -- not the normal weak moan on
          the tape, but a genuinely scary GREMLIN moan.
          He turns around, and sees a grinning GREMLIN emerge from behind
          the prop tombstone. As Fred heads back there, two other
          GREMLINS join the first one, and the three of them watch him
          intently.

           DIRECTOR (O.S. )
           Fred, what's the story with those
          -- things?

           GRANDPA FRED
          Uh.. .I don't...
          One of the Gremlins takes the reel of film from Fred, unreels
          a little from the loose end and holds it up. A second Gremlin
          looks at a frame -- mimes terrified shock, then CLUTCHES his
          chest and falls back onto the floor. The of e%.Gremlins LAUGH.

          Uh -- that ' s right, it ' s real '
          scary --
           The other two Gremlins put their f alongside Fred's and make
          scary snarls. They like it here

          DIRECTOR (O.S.)
          Boy, that's creepy. Okay,
          rolling...

          GRANDPA FRED
          Uh -- Grandpa Fred and his Friends
          have something horrible in store
          for you tonight...
           The Gremlins nod in gleeful agreement.

          Sunlight kills these things.
          That's why they're still in here.
          But when it's sundown -- or when
          they think it is -- they'll all get
          together in one place, so they can
          go out. They'll all be in the

          Billy squeezes Kate tighter, with Gizmo cuddled between them.
          The door to the building opens again -- and Billy's father, the
          inventor RAND PELTZER, comes in.

          little sooner.

          CLAMP
          What is it?
          Rand indicates Gizmo, who's being held by Billy.

          Gizmo looks at Rand, and nods somberly, Stallone-style. Billy
          holds him up, and Rand SPRAYS the chemical over his body.

          A family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow
          sleeping off the end of a long winter.

          EXT. A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING

          The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground,
          and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the
          early morning light.

          INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

          PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall
          gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall,
          talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he
          points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME

          CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape,
          flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad
          lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross
          the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.

          INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

          Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but
          from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out
          of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's
          pointing to -- a national weather map.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME

          The country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets
          heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the
          confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio.

          INT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING

          We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
          volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers
          from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed
          memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award
          statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
          on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.
          As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small
          sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
          blanket.
          GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
          head in the door.

           HAWLEY
           Christ, what a pit. Phil"
          The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley.
          It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.

           PHIL

           (SLEEPY)
           What?

           HAWLEY
           It's February first, Phil. You
           know what tomorrow is?
          Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,
          rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but
          clearly a guy with a lot of personality.

           PHIL
           (catching on)
           Oh, no! Not again.
          He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.

           PHIL
           Forget it! I'm not going.

          

          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9
          Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local
          news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as
          WPGH - Pittsburgh.
          Phil ducks into the studio.

          

           -3-

          

          

          INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

          Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
          corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather
          stats up on a chart.

           PHIL
           Get away from me. I'm working.

           HAWLEY
           So what's the outlook? We gonna
           get that blizzard?
          Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
          "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
          to the title.

           PHIL
           No way. All that moisture coming
           up from the Gulf is going to miss
           us completely and take a dump on
           Harrisburg.

           HAWLEY
           (with authority)
           Good, 'cause you're going up to
           Punxsutawney to cover the
           groundhog story tomorrow morning
           and I want you back here in time
           to do the five.

           PHIL
           Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will
           you! I covered the goddamn
           groundhog last year and the year
           before that.

           HAWLEY
           And you'll do it :next year and
           the year after, too. When I
           worked in San Diego, I covered
           the swallows coming back to
           Capistrano for ten years in a
           row.

           PHIL
           You should've killed the guy who
           made you do that.

           HAWLEY
           I wanted to do it.

           PHIL
           Then you should've killed
           yourself. I don't want to get
           stuck with the groundhog for the
           rest of my life.

          

           -4-

          

           HAWLEY
           It's a cute story. He comes out,
           he looks around, he wrinkles up
           his little nose, he sniffs around
           a little, he sees his shadow, he
           d oesn't see his shadow-- it's
           nice. People like it.

           PHIL
           Many people are morons.

           HAWLEY
           Just do it.

           PHIL
           What'11 you give me?
          Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a
          very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.

           HAWLEY
           (to Phil)
           I'll give you Rita.
           (calls her over)
           Rita, could you come here for a
           second? I got a little job for
           you.
          Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,
          personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,
          a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this
          point to realize it.

           PHIL

           (TEASING)
           You can't send Rita out on a
           story like this. She's just a
           cub, a pup, still wet behind the
           ears. Look at her. Her ears are
           sopping wet. This needs a
           Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a
           big story. People need to know.

           RITA

           (INTRIGUED)
           What's the story?

           HAWLEY
           The Punxsutawney Groundhog
           Festival.

           RITA
           Gil, if it's all right with you
           I ' d rather follow-up on the
           nurses' strike.

          

           -5-

          

           HAWLEY
           You can do the nurses when you
           get back. Just take the squeaky
           wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
           get him back in one piece. Okay?

           RITA
           Yeah, okay.
          Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She
          knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,
          she finds him appealing in an odd way.

           PHIL

           (PLEASANTLY)
           You know, this could be extremely
           interesting.

           RITA
           I've never done a weather story
           before. What's Punxsutawney
           like?

           PHIL
           Oh, it's an enchanted place. A
           magical world. It's the
           Constantinople of the whole
           Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
           Drainage system.

           RITA
           Do you always joke?

           PHIL
           About 70 to 80% of the time.
           Inside I'm actually a very shy
           and sensitive person.

           RITA
           A lot of people around here think
           you're not very sincere.

           PHIL
           Tell me the names of these
           people.

           RITA
           I'll line up a crew and
           transportation. If you don't
           feel like driving, we can all go
           up in the van together.

           PHIL
           I think I'll take my own car.
           I ' m not that fond of my fellow
           man.

          

           -6-

          

          

           RITA

           (EXITING)
           Nice attitude.

           PHIL
           Nice face.
           (calls after her)
           Why don't you ride up with me?

           RITA
           No, thanks.
          STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired
          correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.

          

          INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATER

          Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
          two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number
          of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
          himself on the TV monitor.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           They don't really think of me as
           a weatherman around here. More
           of a "personality," but with the
           credibility of a first-class
           broadcast journalist. Once you
           look at my tape I think you'll
           see what they mean.
          Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for
          a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about
          this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
          scary.

           STEPHANIE

           (BITTERLY)
           I just want to know one thing:
           did I do something wrong or are
           you just tired of me or what? I
           have to know.
          Phil sighs.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           Dan, can I call you back? I've
           just been handed something and I
           better get on it...

           (KINDLY)
           You didn't do anything wrong,
           Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of
           you. It's just that I don't have
           time for a real relationship
           right now. I told you that the
           first time we went out.

           STEPHANIE
           (getting close)
           Everybody says that at the
           beginning of a relationship.

           PHIL
           (gently pushing her

           AWAY)
           I'm different. I really meant
           it! Things are really starting
           to move for me now. I ' m not
           going to be doing the weather for
           the rest of my life. I was just
           talking to the CBS guy about a
           network job. I want that. This
           is just the beginning for me. I
           can't waste any more time.

           STEPHANIE
           Are you saying our relationship
           was a waste of time?

           PHIL
           Our relationship? We went out a
           total of four times! And only
           twice did anything happen. It
           was fun but I don't see that as
           a big commitment.

           STEPHANIE
           (closing in again)
           I had our charts done. My
           astrologer says we're extremely
           compatible. There may even be
           some past lives involvement here.

           PHIL
           See? So we've already done this.
           Let's move on. Next case.

           STEPHANIE
           You know what's wrong with you,
           Phil? You're selfish. You don't
           have time for anyone but
           yourself.

          

           -8-

          

           PHIL
           That's what I ' m trying to tell
           you. You don't want to be with
           me. You can do better. Look,
           Stephanie, if I ever said or did
           anything to mislead you I'm sorry
           for that, but right now I have to
           do this groundhog thing and I
           don't have a handle on it yet.
          He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
          puts on his jacket.

           PHIL (CONT.)
           I'll tell you what. I ' m going to
           do some serious thinking while
           I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?
          He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her

          A VAN marked ".Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane
          highway through the winter landscape of West Central
          Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter.
          Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and

           the night in Punxsutawney all

          everybody gets out.

           PHIL
           I hate this place. I stayed here
           two years ago and I was

           No thanks, I've seen Larry eat.
           Why don't you ditch Larry and let

           dump some locally heavy snow,
           possibly blizzard conditions with

          As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a
          shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs
          like a donkey.

           NED
           Hey, look out for that first
           step! It's a doozy!
          Phil looks at him with murderous contempt.

          EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN

          A big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a
          residential street. They are gathered around a large mound of
          dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For
          a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
          An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
          cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this
          sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters.

          

           -17-

          

          
          Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and
          glances around. Larry, the cameraman, just looks bored.

           RITA
           How could he be late?

           LARRY
           Prima donnas.

           RITA
           It's just so-- inconsiderate.

           LARRY
           What happens to some people?
           They're born nice. They grow up
           nice. You put 'em on TV and -
           bam! Prima donnas.
          Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd.

           RITA
           Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil.
           Over here!
          Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark
          near the rail fence.

           RITA
           Where've you been?

           PHIL
           I got hung up with some jerk I
           went to high school with. So,
           did you sleep okay without me?
           You tossed and turned, didn't
           you?
          Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.

           RITA
           You're incredible.

           PHIL
           Who told you?

           RITA
           Ready when you are.
          Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself
          against the fence.
          The Groundhog Club Officials in top hats, striped trousers and
          cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses Punxsutawney
          Phil.

           RITA
           Looks like they're starting.

           LARRY
           Rolling.
          Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly
          snaps into announce mode.

           PHIL
           (to camera)
           Once a year, the eyes of the
           nation turn here, to this tiny
           hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch
           a master at work. The master?
           Punxsutawney Phil, the world's
           most famous weatherman, the
           groundhog, who, as legend has it,
           can predict the coming of an
           early spring.
          Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good.
          A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and
          ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it
          and retreats.

           PHIL
           And here's the big moment we've
           all been waiting for. Let's just
           see what Mr. Groundhog has to
           say.
          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
          the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about
          as far away from the cameras as he can get.

           PHIL
           Hey! Over here, you little
           weasel!
          Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
          a close-up of the groundhog's back. The groundhog stands there
          a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a
          squeak and runs back into the hole.

           PHIL
           Great shot, huh, folks? Well,
           that was certainly worth the
           trip. Now we'll be hearing from
           Mr. Buster Greene, President of
           the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,
           the so-called Seer of Seers who
           will interpret for us.
          BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat,
          walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.

           He came out, and he saw his
           shadow. Sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.

           PHIL
           (sarcastic, to camera)
           Well, that's it. Sorry you
           couldn't be here in person to
           share the electric moment. This
           is one event where televison
           really fails to capture the
           excitement of thousands of people
           gathered to watch a large
           squirrel predict the weather, and
           I for one am deeply grateful to
           have been a part of it.
           Reporting for Channel 9, this is

          Larry cuts the camera.

           RITA

           That's as sweet as I get. I'm

          As he exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn't expecting
          the throw and bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground.

          to his table and sits down across from him.

           That was really lousy.

           RITA
           Yes, I do. As far as I ' m
           concerned there are no little

           reporters with big egos who think
           they're too good for the job they
           have to do.

           PHIL
           (trying to look hurt)
           You really don't know me very
           well, do you. 'Cause if you did
           you could never say something
           like that about me. I care!
           Call me a cockeyed optimist but
           I happen to think there's more to
           this job than just getting my
           ugly mug on the boob tube every

           RITA
           Is that so.

           PHIL
           Yes, that is so.
          Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond.
          Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment.

           PHIL
           So as far as us getting together,
           would you say the glass is half
           empty or half full?
          Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
          and makes his way over to their table.

           He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and
           notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the
           traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing
           moves.
           He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a

           shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin
           up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks

          Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes
          into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS
          flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding
          but she won't budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux,
          comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the BEST
          MAN restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away.

           know, blizzard thing --

           SIDEKICK
           That "blizzard thing?"
          Phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if
          trying to wake himself up, vaguely disturbed by the repetition
          of the broadcast.

           SIDEKICK (CONT.)
           Oh, here's the report: the
           National Weather Service is
           calling for a big blizzard
           thing."

           DEEJAY
           Yes they are, but there's another
           reason today is very special --

           SIDEKICK
           Especially cold --

           DEEJAY
           Especially cold, okay, but the
           big question on everybody's lips --
          Phil supplies the next line in unison with the radio.

           SIDEKICK AND PHIL
           Chapped lips --

           DEEJAY
           -- on their chapped lips, right --
           Do you think Phil's going to come
           out and see his shadow?

           SIDEKICK
           Punxsutawney Phil.
          Some vague doubt causes Phil to go to the window.

           DEEJAY
           That's right, rodent lovers!

           IT'S--

           BOTH DEEJAYS
           Groundhog Day!
          SOUND EFFECT of GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS as Phil pulls back the
          curtains and looks out.

          HIS POV
          The street is full of people heading toward Gobbler's Knob,
          exactly as they did the day before.

           PHIL

           What the hell?

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. BED AND BREAKFAST - DAWN

          Phil rushes out into the corridor, hastily tying his tie, his
          suit jacket and overcoat over his arm. As he heads for the
          breakfast room, the same Chubby Man passes.

           CHUBBY MAN
           Morning.

           PHIL
           Morning.

           CHUBBY MAN
           Think it'll be an early Spring?

           PHIL
           (stops, irritated)
           Didn't we do this yesterday?

           CHUBBY MAN

           (INTIMIDATED)
           I don't know what you mean.
          Phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into
          his eyes.

           PHIL
           Don't mess with me, pork chop.
           What day is this?

           CHUBBY MAN

           (TERRIFIED)
           Febr uary second--Groundhog Day!
          Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the
          poor man.

           PHIL
           Okay. Sorry. I'm having a bad
           day.
          Phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted.

           CHUBBY MAN
           (to himself)
           I'll say.

          

           -28-

          

          INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Phil enters the old library of the house and finds everything
          exactly as it was the day before. Mrs. Lancaster spots Phil as
          she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           (completely confused)
           D i d I? I don't know--

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Would you like some coffee?

           PHIL
           Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a
           little strange.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           ( as she pours)
           I wonder what the weather's going
           to be like for all the
           festivities.

           PHIL
           Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs.
           Lancaster?

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Is that the Italian dessert with
           the brandy and the chocolate
           mousse?

           PHIL
           No, that's spaghetti. Never
           mind.
          He heads for the door, still in a daze.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Oh, will you be checking out
           today, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL

           (VAGUELY)
           I don't know. I don't think so.
           I'll tell you after I wake up.
          Phil exits.

           CUT TO:

          

           -29-

          

          EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Phil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up
          from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps
          of the house. He accosts a PASSERBY.

           PHIL
           Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's
           everybody going?

           PASSERBY
           To Gobbler's Knob. It's
           Groundhog Day!
          The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open-
          mouthed. Then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if
          trying to clear it and starts off down the street.

          

          EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS

          Phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD
          BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront.

           NED RYERSON (O.C.)
           Hey, Phil!
          Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude.

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
           that was you!
          Phil just stares at him and keeps walking.

           NED
           My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't
           say you don't remember me, 'cause
           I sure as heck-fire remember you.
           Well?

           PHIL
           Ned Ryerson?

           NED
           Bing! First shot right out of
           the box. So how's it going, ol'
           buddy?

           PHIL
           To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m
           not feeling real well. Could you
           excuse me?

           NED
           Now it's funny you should mention
           your health 'cause you'll never
           guess what I do.

          

           -30-

          

           PHIL
           (very distressed and
           desperate to get away
           from this guy)
           Do you sell insurance, Ned?

           NED
           Bing again! You're sharp as a
           tack today. Do you have life
           insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you
           do, I bet you could use more --
           who couldn't?" -- but I got a
           feeling you don't have any. Am
           I right?

           PHIL
           (really annoyed now)
           Did I say "fuck off, " Ned? I
           can't talk to you right now.
          He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep,
          slushy puddle he stepped in the day before.

           NED

           (BRAYING)
           Hey, look .out for that first v
           step. It's a doozyi
          Phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off
          toward Gobbler's Knob.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT . GOBBLER ' S KNOB - DAWN
          The crowd is gathered as before for the big moment.
          In the press area, Rita is having the same dialogue with Larry,
          when she spots Phil heading into the crowd.

           RITA
           Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil!
           Over here!
          Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of
          the Knob, gesturing for her to follow.
          Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward
          Phil. She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in
          the snow with his foot. She notices immediately that he is
          uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair
          mussed.

           RITA
           Where ' ve you been?

          

           -31-

          

           PHIL
           (nervous, sweat ing)
           I've got to talk to you. I think
           I'm losing my mind.

           . RITA
           I know you're losing it. What
           are you doing over here? The
           camera's over there.

           PHIL
           Slap me, Rita.

           RITA
           What is this?

           PHIL

           (INSISTENT)
           Just slap me-- hard.
          She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek.

           PHIL
           I said hardl

          . . .. ... .RITA .
           I can't!

           PHIL
           Do it!
          Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard.

           PHIL
           (his cheek smarting)
           Better. Almost too hard, Rita.

           RITA
           Are you drunk?

           PHIL
           No, drunk is more fun. Can I be
           serious with you for a minute?

           RITA
           I don't know. Can you?

           PHIL
           Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m
           having a problem-- no, I may be
           having a problem.

           RITA
           What are you trying to say?

          

           -32-

          

           PHIL
           I'm trying to say that if I was
           having a problem, just
           hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know
           that you're someone I could count
           on in a crisis.

           RITA

           (WORRIED)
           What did you do last night?
          The crowd begins to hush.

           LARRY
           We better get started. We're
           going to miss it.

           PHIL
           Were not going to miss it.
           (indicating the other

           REPORTERS)
           They're going to miss it.

           RITA

           (EMPHATIC)
           Phil. We've been out here for an
           hour. We're cold and tired.
           Let's just get this and get out
           of here.

           PHIL
           Okay, put it here.

           RITA
           What?

           PHIL
           Put the camera here .
          Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all
          of the other cameras are set up .

           RITA
           Phil , there is no tomorrow on
           this one. It's Groundhog Day.

           PHIL
           We were in the wrong spot
           yesterday .

           RITA

           (IRKED)
           W ha t? Yesterday? What are you
           talking about?

           PHIL
           Just trust me. Put the camera
           here .

          

           -33-

          

          
          Rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and
          gives up.

           RITA
           Larry!
          She charges off toward the cameras.
          In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to
          their cameras, dribbling on about how "He could appear any
          second now." Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to
          Phil.
          Larry hurriedly sets up the camera.

           LARRY
           You want me to roll tape?

           RITA
           (to Phil)
           Are you going to get on your
           mark?

           PHIL
           No hurry.
          Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to
          their cameras and pointing towards the mound.

           LARRY

           (DESPERATELY)
           Everyone else is rolling!
          Rita looks helplessly at Phil.

           RITA
           I'm begging you, all right?
           Gould we please just do this?
          Phil glances down at his watch.

           PHIL
           Okay, let's do it.
          He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder.

           PHIL
           Roll tape.

           LARRY

           (MUMBLING)
           Prima donnas.
          Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself
          against the fence.

           LARRY
           Rolling.

          

           -34-

          
          Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this
          time it's a bit tentative.

           PHIL
           (to camera)
           We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again--
           and you know what that means.
           Everybody's here on Gobbler's
           Knob waiting in the cold for the
           appearance of the most famous
           groundhog in the world,
           Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to
           tell us just how much more of
           this we can expect.
          The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door,
          then opens it and retreats.
          Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
          prediction, recalling the previous day.

           PHIL
           My forecast is we're going to see
           the groundhog peek its head out
           of its hole, look around a little
           bit, then he's going to come out,
           scamper over to this general
           area, look at the crowd for a
           second, make a little burping
           noise and run back into the
           ground.

           RITA
           (whispers to Larry)
           That's it. I'm going to kill
           him.
          Phil looks at his watch.

           PHIL
           O k ay ? And here we go--
          Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in.
          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
          steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
          directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body
          casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the
          camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
          Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
          brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil.
          Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog
          burrow.

          

           -35-

          

           RITA

           (HISSES)
           Phil!
          Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the
          mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before.

           BUSTER
           He came out, and he saw his
           shadow. Sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in
          disappointment.
          Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in
          a fog, without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita.

           RITA
           (at a loss)
           For Channel 9 News, this is Rita
           Hanson in Punxsutawney.
          She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her
          finger across her throat.

          INT; PHIL'S ROOM
          Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           I know there's a blizzard, but I
           have to get a call through to my
           doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a
           medical emergency. . . .No, don't
           give me the Punxsutawney Fire
           Department. When do you think
           the long distance lines will be
           working again?. . . But what if we
           don't have a tomorrow? We didn't
           have one today, my friend...
           Hello...Hello?
          He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to
          ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls
          the covers up over his head. A moment later, he sits up, takes
          a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the
          pieces back on the nightstand. Then he lies back down and
          retreats back under the covers.

          CLOSE UP - CLOCK
          The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The
          radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I
          Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN

          Phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the
          nightstand. The pencil is whole again. Completely stunned by

          store.

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - LATER

          Phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed. Out fall a couple
          of big paintbrushes, a small sledgehammer, a handsaw, a
          crowbar, plastic goggles and assorted other tools. He puts on
          the goggles, grabs a hammer and some nails and starts nailing
          the door shut.

          EXT. CORRIDOR - LATER

          Mrs. Lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the
          hall outside Phil's room, listening at the door and looking
          very worried. Loud music is playing inside the room.
          From inside the room, they hear the sound of loud hammering,
          wood splintering and glass breaking.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
          in the room. He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
          the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
          sink.
          Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
          to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing
          heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
          going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
          head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
          mirror with his sledgehammer.
          Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
          madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
          room with it.
          As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,
          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
          feathers.
          Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can
          hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
          We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
          the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
          reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
          and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil
          sleeping on the bed.
          He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No
          paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy
          as the day he checked in.
          He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His
          hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.
          The song ends and the deejays come on. Phil says every word
          right along with them, shocked into a state of complete
          wonderment.

           . . . S o according to Mr. Groundhog
           I guess we can expect six more
           weeks of winter. It's not very
           scientific, but it sure is fun.

           It was good. A little smarmy for

           sells.

           PHIL
           Could I talk to you about a
           matter that is not work related?

           RITA

           Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the
           punchline.

           PHIL
           No, really. It's like today
           never happened. I shaved my head
           last night, today its all grown
           back. I could probably cut off
           my limbs, one by one, and - pop!
           They'd grow back. Just like a

           some course in school that

          as he screeches around the corner.

          

          INT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS

          Phil is having a great time. Gus and Ralph are whooping it up
          like kids on a roller coaster.

           PHIL
           This is great, Ralph!

           RALPH
           Oh, hey, take a left!
          Phil passes the intersection.

           RALPH
           You missed it!

           PHIL
           No problem --

          

          EXT . MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          Phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding U-turn, goes up
          on the curb, across a couple of lawns, takes out a mailbox and
          a STOP sign and bounces back onto the street.
          A POLICE CAR parked in front of the hardware store pulls out
          and takes off after him.

          

          INT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS

          Phil swerves in and out of oncoming traffic. Gus is starting
          to look a little green.

           PHIL
           So many rules --

          

           -47-

          

           RALPH
           You can say that again.

           PHIL
           "Don't do this--"

          

          EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

          The Buick demolishes a parked car.

           PHIL (V.O.)
           "Don't do that -- "
          He mows down a row of parking meters.

          POLICE CAR
          It comes screaming around a corner in hot pursuit of the Buick

          

          INT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS

          Ralph hears the siren and looks back at the police car.

          
           All right! Try and stop us, you
           mothers !

           PHIL
           No more rules!

           RALPH
           No more rules!

          

          EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

          A second police car joins the chase.

           RALPH
           (looking back)
           That's two!

           PHIL
           Having a good time?

           RALPH
           I'm having a great time!
          Phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour. Gus is looking
          even worse from the liquor and the motion of the car.

           GUS
           Hey, uh --

           PHIL
           Phil.

          

           -48-

          

           GUS
           Yeah, Phil-- like the groundhog.

           PHIL
           Right.

           GUS
           Hey, Phil? How're we going to
           get out of this?

          THEIR POV - THE INTERSECTION AHEAD
          Two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways,
          completely blocking the road. Officers stand in the roadway,
          motioning for Phil to stop.

           PHIL

           (CALMLY)
           Gus, you're just going to have to
           trust me on this one.
          He tromps the gas pedal to the floor. Gus's eyes go wide with
          terror.
          The police dive out of the way.

           PHIL AND RALPH
           Yahooooo!

          THEIR POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
          The Buick crashes head on into one of the police cars.

           BLACK OUT:

          C LOSE UP - CLOCK
          The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing
          "I Got You, Babe."
          Phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed. He
          is in his room at the bed and breakfast, everything exactly the
          same as before. He hops out of bed and quickly examines
          himself for signs of physical injury. Nothing. The music ends
          and the two deej ays come on.

           DEEJAY
           Okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's COOOLD out there
           today.
          Phil talks out loud along with them.

           PHIL AND SIDEKICK
           It's cold out there everyday.
           What is this-- Miami Beach?

          

           -49-

          
          The deejays laughs. Phil laughs, too, exhilirated at having
          survived the car wreck, still very confused and perplexed, but
          just beginning to see the possibilities of his unique
          situation. He starts dressing in a hurry.

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Phil rushes into the breakfast room just as Mrs. Lancaster
          comes out of the kitchen with the coffee. Everything is
          exactly the same as before.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           W o u l d you--
          Phil interrupts, answering all her questions before she even
          asks them.

           PHIL

           (URGENTLY)
           Yes, I would like some coffee;
           the weather is going to be cold
           and overcast with blizzard
           conditions moving in later today;
           and yes, I will be staying an
           extra day.

           MRS. LANCASTER

           (BAFFLED)
           Why thank you.

           PHIL
           Mrs. Lancaster, has anyone been
           around here looking for me this
           morning? Maybe a state official,
           blue coat, hat, gun, nightstick,
           badge, driving a late-model Ford
           br Chevy, black and white with
           bub ble lights on top--

           MRS. LANCASTER

           (SHOCKED)
           No, no one like that-- I .don't--
           Will they be?

           PHIL
           (greatly relieved)
           Apparently not.
          Phil gooses her, grabs a sweet roll, and heads for the door,
          starting to believe now that he can truly do anything he wants
          to.

           CUT TO:

          

           -50-

          

          EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAWN

          Phil stops on the steps, puts on his coat and gloves and again
          joins the traffic heading toward Gobbler's Knob.

          

          EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          Phil passes the old bum, ignoring him as usual.

           NED (O.C.)
           Hey, Phil!
          Phil slips off his glove as Ned Ryerson lumbers toward him.

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors!

           PHIL
           Ned! Ned Ryerson! Ned the Head!
          Before Ned can say another word, Phil SLUGS HIM. Ned goes
          down, Phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking.
          Phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he stepped in before. A
          PEDESTRIAN walking behind him steps right into it.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT . GOBBLER'S KNOB - LATER
          Phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area
          when he notices NANCY, the girl he met at the hotel bar, and
          stops to talk to her.

           PHIL
           You here to see the groundhog?
          She gives him a look. It's obvious she's never seen him
          before.

           NANCY
           Can you think of another reason
           anybody'd be out here at dawn on
           a freezing day?

           PHIL
           What's your name?

           NANCY
           Nancy Taylor. And you are--

          

           PHIL
           Where'd you go to high school?

          

           -51-

          

           NANCY
           What is this?

           PHIL

           (PLAYFUL)
           High school?
          She really doesn't know what to make of Phil but she decides to
          play along.

           NANCY
           Lincoln High school. In
           Pittsburgh. Who are you?

           PHIL
           Who was your twelfth grade
           English teacher?

           NANCY
           Are you kidding?

           PHIL
           I'm waiting.

           NANCY
           .Mrs. Walsh.

           PHIL
           Walsh. Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh.

           NANCY
           Is this some kind of come-on?

           PHIL
           I'm not really sure. We'll have
           to see.
          Phil walks off and joins Rita at their camera position.

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. DINER - LATER THAT MORNING

          Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an
          incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage,
          pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc.
          Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs
          himself with pastry.

           RITA
           Is this some new fad diet? Don't
           you worry about cholesterol?
          Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate
          eclair.

          

           -52-

          

           PHIL
           I don't worry about anything
           anymore.

           RITA
           What makes you so special?
           Everybody worries about
           something.

           PHIL
           That's exactly what makes me so
           special.
          He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head.

           PHIL
           (with his mouth full)
           What?

           RITA
           "The wretch, concentered all
           in self,
           Living, shall forfeit fair
           renown,
           And doubly dying, shall go
           down to the vile dust from
           whence he sprung,
           Unwept, unhonored, and
           unsung." Sir Walter Scott.

           PHIL
           (stares at her for a
           long moment)
           "There was a young man from
           Na n t uc k e t-- "

           RITA
           That's really funny. When are
           you going to grow up, Phil?

           PHIL
           At this rate-- never.
           (he pulls out a pack of

           CIGARETTES)
           Okay if I smoke?
          Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette.

           RITA
           You really do have a death wish,
           don't you?

           PHIL
           Just the opposite, Rita. I have
           a life wish. I'm just trying to
           enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the
           little things. Don't you ever
           just want to cut loose and go
           wild?

          

           -53-

          

           RITA
           I wouldn't even know what it
           means to go wild.

           PHIL
           Yeah, well, that's where I come
           in. Going wild is one of my
           specialties. Last night I got
           completely loaded and drove head-
           on into a police car.

           RITA

           (DISBELIEVING)
           Oh, really? You look pretty good
           this morning.

           PHIL
           That's my point. I know you
           won't believe me, but we could do
           anything we want today and it
           wouldn't matter one bit.
           Absolutely no consequences.
           Complete and total freedom.

           RITA
           And how. . , do we manage that?

           PHIL
           You leave that to me. Why don't
           you send Larry back and hang out
           with me for the rest of the day?
           You never make it through that
           blizzard anyway.
          Larry enters the diner and spots them.

           RITA
           I'll take my chances with the
           -weather. But you have a good
           time.

           PHIL
           Don't worry. I plan to.

          EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - NEXT MORNING

          Phil comes through the crowd and finds Nancy in the same spot
          she was in the day before.

           PHIL
           Nancy?
          Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically.

          

           -54-

          

           PHIL
          Nancy, right?

          I'm sorry, I--

           NANCY
          I don't-- sure, I think--

           PHIL
          We used to shoot spit balls--

           NANCY
          Yeah, oh, God--

           PHIL
          I even asked you to the prom.

           But maybe after we could --

           Yeah, yeah, I ' d like that --

           RITA (O.C.)
           Phil!
          Rita is calling from across the crowd. She looks at him with
          disapproval .

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Phil is making passionate love to a WOMAN in the dark.

           WOMAN

           (MOANS)
           Oh, Phil.

           PHIL
           Oh , Rita .
          The woman suddenly freezes. There is a moment of silence, then
          she snaps on the light. It's Nancy, not Rita. Phil is as
          surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue.

           NANCY

           (COLD)
           Who's Rita?

           PHIL

           (CAUGHT)
           No one. It's just something I
           say when I make love. You know --
           "Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like
           "Oh, baby" or something.

           NANCY
           (not entirely

           CONVINCED)
           Oh.

           PHIL
           (corrects her)
           O-rita.
          Nancy laughs uncertainly. Phil switches off the light,
          thinking now about Rita.

          INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING

          Some elderly GUESTS are sipping coffee and eating breakfast,
          staring uncomfortably at something on the other side of the
          room.

          THEIR POV
          Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas,
          absently munching on a Danish as he reads from one of the
          books.
          Mrs. Lancaster approaches him.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Isn't it a wonderful collection?

           PHIL
           (not looking up)
           Yes, it is. You don't usually
           find this many trashy novels in
           one place.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           You can take a book up to your
           room if you like.

           PHIL
           No, thank you. I've actually
           read them all. I was just
           rereading some of the dirty
           parts.
          He finishes and puts the book back on the shelf.

           MRS. LANCASTER

           (WORRIED)
           How long will you be staying with
           us, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           Indefinitely. I've already been
           here for 211 days.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           (humoring him)
           Really? That's quite a long
           time, isn't it. I hope you're
           finding things to do in our
           little town.

           PHIL

           (CASUALLY)
           Yes, well, I'm getting a little
           tired of casual sex so today I
           thought I'd rob a bank and buy

          Two harmless-looking old GUARDS are calmly loading bags of cash
          into an armored car parked in front of a local bank. Suddenly
          Phil appears, wielding a shotgun, wearing a Batman style cape,
          his face completely hidden by a ski mask.

           PHIL

           (SHOUTS)
           All right, freeze!! Drop your
           guns J!
          The guards stand there frozen with terror.

           PHIL
           You guys ever been held up
           before?
           (they shake their

           HEADS)
           It's kind of exciting, isn't it?

           FIRST GUARD

           (FRIGHTENED)
           I guess so. Something to tell
           the kids about.

           PHIL
           Yeah. By the way, I'm Phil.
          He raises the mask and shows his face.

          Phil pats the hood of a used BMW 850 sports car as a SALESMAN

           PHIL
           I'll tell you what. I'll give
           you $70,000 if you just knock off
           the car salesman stuff and let me
           get out of here with my car.

          The BMW comes screeching to a stop right in front of the movie
          theater and the door opens.
          A pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver
          spurs hits the pavement first; then we PAN UP to see Phil
          emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit
          with real six-guns on his hips. A very trashy-looking girl,
          LARAINE, gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a French
          maid.

           LARAINE
           (very self-conscious)
           I thought we were going to a
           costume party.

           PHIL
           Yeah, we are, we are. But first
           I have this movie theater fantasy

          Sid Viscious on crack. He takes off his hat to reveal red,
          white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull. A slut
          named ANGIE and another overweight, not very pretty MADONNA
          WANNA-BE, both in too-tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on
          to him, practically licking his ears. Angie pops a couple of
          mystery pills into his mouth. Phil washes them down with a

          It looks like ;outtakes from Fellini's "Satyricon." Heavy metal
          is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and
          women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off
          whatever hit them. Someone is knocking loudly on the door,
          shouting complaints about the music. A beer bottle smashes
          against the door.
          Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie. He has his arm
          around her shoulder and a fifth of Wild Turkey in his hand.

           PHIL
           (more to himself than
           to Angie)
           Yeah, but eventually you' d just
           get tired of screwing around and
           then you'd want a real
           relationship, wouldn't you?

           ANGIE
           I don't know.
          A big German Shepherd tries to jump up on the bed with them.

           (still musing)
           It's tough to find a relationship
           like that, especially if your
           time is kind of limited. But you
           still have to try, don't you?

           How do you know so much about
           Punxsutawney?

           PHIL
           I like small towns. I think they
           engender real community more than
           big cities.

           RITA
           That is so true! I've always
           thought that, too.

           PHIL
           No kidding. Here-- try the white
           chocolate.

           RITA
           Oh, yuk, don't make me sick.

           PHIL
           (making mental note)
           No white chocolate.

           There's something so familiar
           about this. Do you ever have
           deja vu?

           this town. We're going to be
           stuck here all night1

          There is a light snow falling. Phil and Rita are making a
          little snowman. Somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old
          fashioned, wholesome.
          A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to
          see a giggling KID. Phil packs a snowball and tosses it. The
          kid throws one back. Rita and Phil both get into it, packing
          snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little
          gang of friends.
          A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a
          snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no
          together, lying in the snow, laughing. Their eyes lock for a
          long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up.

           You're wrong. I've been planning
           this day for weeks.
           Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her
           but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him.

          There is a long moment of silent tension, then all her old
          doubts about Phil come rushing back.

           (shaking her head)
           Oh, no. I can't believe I fell
           for it. This whole day was just
           one long set-up. And I ate
           fudge. Yucchh! I hate fudge.

           No, it was real. I love you.

          Phil's gun droops. The woman begins to walk off, then stops.

          EXT. CIVIC CENTER - DAY

          Phil passes a pedestal bearing a life-size bronze statue of the
          groundhog and enters the public library.

          

          INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

          Phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and
          dangerous, and enters the children's section. No one is
          present except the CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN, a young woman,
          reshelving books in the stacks. He looks around quickly and
          sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads:
          "Punxsutawney Phil - The Great Prognosticates"
          Phil heads right for it.
          The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled
          habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger.
          As Phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his
          overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip.
          The children's librarian sees the gun and freezes.
          Phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the
          case.

          PHIL'S POV
          The groundhog looks right into his sights.
          Philsqueezes the trigger. LOUD GUNSHOT.
          The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. The
          groundhog looks up playfully.
          Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil
          can't believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the
          rifle butt. He can't even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from
          behind by TWO STRONG MEN who take the rifle from him and
          wrestle him to floor.
          The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog.

           BYSTANDER
           Is he all right?

           LIBRARIAN
           He's just fine. That's two
           inches of bullet-proof glass
           there. You can't be too careful
           in this day and age.

          The groundhog is just poking his head out of the hole. He
          stands full height and looks around.
          Phil looks directly at the groundhog with hate and scheming
          madness.
          Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his
          icoat and dives at the groundhog. Town officials and police
          throw themselves on Phil as the groundhog scampers safely back
          into his hole.
          Rita and Larry videotape the incident, aghast at Phil's insane
          attack.

          Larry and Rita are loading their equipment back into the van.
          Rita spots Phil standing on the other side of the crowd,
          staring at her. She marches straight over to him, furious.

           RITA
           Where were you this morning? How
           could you possibly miss the
           shoot?

           PHIL
           (at the end of his

           ROPE)
           I've come to the end of me, Rita.
           There's only one way out now.
           Just remember/we had a wonderful
           day together once.
          Phil kisses her gently on the cheek and walks off toward the
          back of the knob. Rita watches him, then follows at a discreet
          distance, very worried.
          In a small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow,
          Buster Greene and TWO other GROUNDHOG CLUB OFFICIALS are
          lifting a cage into the front seat of Buster's pickup.

           B USTER
           (to the groundhog)
           There you go, ol' buddy. Good
           job. Hey! He smiled at me. See

          The other official looks up and sees Phil walking toward them
          like a zombie.

           OTHER OFFICIAL
           Hi, there, mister. Something I
           can do you for?
          Without a word, Phil jumps quickly into the cab of the pickup
          and starts it up .

           FIRST OFFICIAL
           Hey! What 're you -- !
          Phil drives off in Buster's truck.
          Rita witnesses the groundhog-napping and runs back toward the
          knob.

           the word out. Somebody kidnapped
           Phil. We're going after him.
           Come on, Tommy!
          They jump into a car, Buster guns the engine and takes off
          after the pickup.
          Rita runs up to Larry and grabs the camera on the fly.

           RITA
           Let's go! Phil just snatched the
           groundhog!
          Larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the

          INT. THE PICKUP - SAME TIME

          Phil looks in his rearview mirror at the cars chasing him. He
          glances down at the groundhog. He takes a breath.

          The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it
          begins its SLOW MOTION descent, falling ever so gracefully
          until it impacts on the granite rock face far below.
          BIG EXPLOSION. BIG FIREBALL. FLAMING WRECKAGE. Then a small

           You like boats but not the ocean.
           There's a lake you go to in the
           summer with your family, up in
           the mountains, with an old wooden
           dock and a boathouse with boards
           missing in the roof, and a place
           you used to crawl underneath to
           be alone, and at night you'd look
           up and see the stars. You're a
           sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon
           Brando, and French poetry.
           You're wonderfully generous;
           you're kind to strangers, and
           children; and when you stand in
           the snow, you look like an angel.

          

           RITA
           How are you doing this?

           PHIL
           I told you! I wake up every day
           right here, right in
           Punxsutawney, and it's always
           February second and I can't turn

           and take you away from me.

           RITA
           Larry?

           PHIL
           But you can't let him. Please

           believe me.

           RITA
           I don't --
          Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around and spots
          Rita.

           PHIL
           Look.
          As Rita turns around to see Larry, Phil grabs a pen and pad
          from a passing waitress and quickly writes something down as
          Larry makes his way to their table. Phil finishes writing.

           LARRY
           (to Rita)
           You ready? We better get going
           if we're going to stay ahead of
           the weather.
          Phil hands the paper to Rita. She reads it.

           RITA

           (READING)
           " . . . stay ahead of the weather. "
          Larry looks at the paper.

           Afer I got over the shock, it was
           kind of fun for the first year or
           two. I had anything I wanted.

           I used to try to stay up all

           could stay conscious I could
           figure out what was going on, or
           at least hang onto something from
           the day before. But I gave up on
           that a long time ago.
          Rita looks at him with compassion.

          Rita comes to a decision.

          carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to
          her.

           from the first minute I looked at
           you I wanted to just hold you
           close and be with you forever.
           iEverytime I -saw you around the
           station, I thought my heart was
           going to explode. I used to
           dream about us being together.

           as I loved you and we didn't have
           to say anything but I knew you
           understood everything.
          She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep
          sleep.

           I know a guy like me could never
           deserve to have someone like you,
           but if I did, I swear I would
           love you for the rest of my life.

          Phil stands in front of the camera, giving his report.

           PHIL
           In fact, the groundhog's
           legendary ability to predict the
           weather may be more than just the
           German folklore of the region.
           Higher temperatures trigger
           hormonal changes in the
           testosterone levels of male
           groundhogs, which may in fact
           wake them from hibernation and
           send them out to battle with
           other males ;for mating rights.
           So, the truth is they're not
           looking for their shadows,
           they're looking for groundhog
           chicks.

           PHIL
           Groundhog Day, February second,
           also known as Candlemas Day or
           the Feast of the Purification of
           the Virgin Mary, the day Mary
           first came to the temple for
           ritual blessings following the
           birth of the infant Jesus, and
           celebrated since the Middle Ages
           by the sacramental lighting of
           candles. Hence the old Scottish
           couplet which long predates the
           .American groundhog tradition: "If
           Candlemas dawns bright and clear,
           there'll be two winters in the
           year."

          Behind him, Phil is chipping away at a small hunk of marble,
          sculpting a very lovely cherub.
          Rita sits on a stool eating an apple and sipping hot tea
          watching him with amazed interest.

           PHIL
           But what if the rules changed?
           What if none of your actions had
           consequences?

           RITA
           There would still be an absolute
           morality. There has to be an

           PHIL
           Oh, is that so, Miss Plato? Then

           A big tail? Okay, a big tail.

           KIDS
           Neck! A big neck!
          Phil makes an animal really quickly.
          Rita watches from the doorway, unseen by Phil.

           PHIL
           There. A dog with long legs.

           KIDS
           Nooo ! Long neck !

           PHIL
           Oh! Right! A dog with a big
           head.

           KIDS
           Noooo!
          The kids attack Phil. Lots of rolling around on the bed. Rita
          watches, completely enthralled.
          Finally, Phil extricates himself and exits to find Rita
          waiting.

           RITA
           All right, now what's going on?

           PHIL
           (taking her arm)
           Come on. We have to hurry.

          EXT . RESIDENTIAL STREET - A LITTLE LATER
          Phil rushes down the sidewalk with Rita close behind him. He
          stops under a tree and puts his arms out just as a YOUNG BOY
          falls out of the tree and into his arms, knocking him to the
          ground. The kid runs off unhurt as Phil gets back to his feet
          and brushes himself off.

           PHIL
           (to Rita)
           That little bastard has never
           thanked me once . I ought to j ust
           let him fall. Teach him a
           lesson.

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Phil kneels on the cold ground beside the old bum who lies
          huddled against the wall, immobile.
          Rita is standing by at the end of the alley, watching as Phil
          examines him.
          Phil writes something down on a small pad. He finishes, and
          sets it down by the old man. Then he takes his coat and uses
          it to cover the man up. A siren is heard.
          Phil stands and walks away, as an ambulance pulls into the
          alley.

           RITA
           Is he -- ?

           . 'PHIL
           Yeah. Let's go.

           RITA
           In a minute.
          She waits and watches.
          The paramedics, BUD and ANDY, get out of the ambulance and
          inspect the scene.

           BUD
           It's ol1 Really.

           ANDY
           That's a shame.

           BUD
           Look here .
          Bud picks up the note Phil left.
          Rita steps closer.

           RITA
           May I see that?
           (reading aloud)
           "Every night, by cold bricks

           BUD
           Wow, that's nice.
          Rita hands him the note and quickly walks away.

           ANDY
           Suppose he wrote it?

          Phil and Rita walk into a banquet room decorated with
          streamers, balloons and flowers. There is a long buffet table
          and a punch bowl. Another long table is loaded with wedding
          gifts. A small band is playing.
          People are dancing. The wedding party is dressed in rented
          tuxedos and appropriately pouffy bridesmaid dresses.

           RITA
           This is incredible. Who's

          Phil grabs two glasses of champagne and hands one to Rita.

           PHIL
           Just some friends. Dorisi
          The bride, DORIS, young and cheery, is on her way to see Phil.
          She is dragging FRED, her groom, with her.

           DORIS
           Hi, Mr. Connors! Come ON,
           Freddy.

           FRED
           Hi.

           DORIS
           This is the guy I told you about.

           FRED
           No way!

           PHIL
           How's it going, Fred?

           FRED
           Hey, I ' d like to thank you for
           making Doris go through with
           this.

           PHIL
           Are you kidding? Don't buy that
           playing hard to get stuff. She's
           crazy about you, you stud.

           DORIS
           I ' m really glad you could come.

           PHIL
           Congratulations.
          Phil reaches into his pocket, pulls out two tickets and hands
          them to Doris.

           DORIS
           What is this? Oh, no way! No
           way! Ahhh!
          Doris throws herself on Fred and jumps up and down. Fred grabs
          the tickets.

           FRED
           Wrestlemania! No way! No way!
          Doris throws herself on Phil.

           We're like going to be in
           Pittsburgh anyway.

           PHIL
           I don't know. I just thought
           about you two, tried to picture
           what you ' d want more than
           anything in the world and it came
           to me. Bing! Wrestlemania.

           FRED
           Thanks, Mr. Connors. You're a
           real pal.

           DORIS
           This is the best!
          Doris gives Phil a kiss. She and Fred move on.

           RITA
           I don ' t understand . You rush
           from one person to the next in a
           town you only visit once a year,

           leading citizen.
          The band finishes a set. The guests stop dancing and head for
          the refreshments. Phil and Rita are left alone for the moment

           PHIL
           What do you want to know?

           RITA
           Who are you?

           PHIL
           I really don't know.

           RITA
           No, there's something going on
           with you.

           PHIL
           Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney
           on February second -- every day.
           It's supernatural. I don't even
           try to explain it anymore. So,
           I live each day as if it's the
           only day I've got.
          Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only
          good, true things.

           RITA
           That's pretty amazing. "

           PHIL
           You want to know what's really
           amazing? I've been waiting for
           you every day for ten thousand
           years. I dream of you every
           night of my life. You've been my
           constant weapon against total
           despair, and just knowing you
           exist has kept me alive. How's
           that?
          Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing
          anybody has ever said to anybody.
          Mary the piano teacher notices Phil.

           MARY
           Phil!
           (to her friend)
           This is the guy.

           PHIL
           Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one
           of Punxsey's finest musicians.

           ·MARY
           Give me a break. You should
           talk. Why don't you play
           something?

           PHIL
           N o , I--

           MARY
           Please.

           FRED
           Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it.
          Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs.
          Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins
          to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls
          silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears.
          Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil
          transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.
          Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,
          everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.
          An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up
          a storm.

           LEO
           That's a great guy you've got
           there. Doctor Connors fixed my
           back, you know.

          It is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm
          in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita.
          She looks like an angel.

          

           PHIL
           Wait! Don't move!

          
          Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously,
          joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.

          

           RITA
           Making a snow man? I'll help.

          Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on
          a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it.

          Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model
          a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look
          o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work.

          

           RITA
           Can I look?

          

           PHIL
           O kay, look.

          
          It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as
          alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.

           my eyes and there you are-- just
           like this. Take it home and keep
           it in the freezer.
          Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into
          each others eyes.

           PHIL
           This one's for the Frog Prince.

           RITA
           What?

           PHIL
           Nothing.
          They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.

           PHIL
           Will you come with me?
          Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming
          each other in the cold night air.

          different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed
          now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep
          under the covers.

          pajama bottoms.

           Phi l? Phil!
          Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else
          in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly
          playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few
          bars.

           PHIL (O.C.)
           Yeah!!!!
          Phil runs back into the room.

           And so began my final lifetime,
           and ended the longest winter on
           record. I would find myself no
           longer able to affect the chain
           of events in this town, but I did
           learn something about time. You
           can waste time, you can kill
           time, you can do time, but if you
           use it wisely, there's never
           enough of it. So you'd better
           make the most of the time you've
           got.
          A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita
          rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita
          and Phil continue their walk.

           Larry never got through the
           blizzard, so none of my groundhog
           reports ever made it on the air.
           But Rita and I-- we lived happily
           ever after.
          Phil and Rita walk off together.
          Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson
          who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.

           NED
           But Phil told me you were his
           accountant!

           LARRY
           Look, I told you! He's nuts!
          Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.

           NED
           Let me just tell you about single
           premium life--
          Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned
          floundering in a snowbank.
          Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
          revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside
          that embraces it.

          FADE IN:
          BLACK. It's everywhere. It swallows the screen. And so we stare
          into a sea of BLACK.

          I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.
          The end came abruptly you could tell
          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.
          "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like
          it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley"
          or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't
          forget things like that. Like you don't
          forget the sound animals make when
          they're humping. Primal.
          Raw. They endure
          in you forever because the senses have a
          brain all their own and they recall long
          after you've succumbed to the la-la of
          forgetfulness.

          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.

          (BEAT)
          And it starts all over again.
          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           We are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging
          o f a howling WIND. across the black sky..It brings RAIN and THUNDER an d the swirl
          An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness.
          weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the
          A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE
          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
          It's a man.
          It's a man, plus.
          It's a SUPERHERO,
          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
          Disheveled. Worn. A face
          chiselled with mileage.
          

          

          2.
          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
          down the street like loose change.
          The rain continues its onslaught.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
          dinner before them.
          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
          low fat milk.
          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
          attitude.
          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.

          MARY
          The principal did'nothing. Like
          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
          being tardy. What's the matter with
          education? Back when, you could go to
          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
          way home.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
          gait.
          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
          raped subway wall.
          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...

          "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
          Deposits it under his coat.
          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
          above.
          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
          out of his clothes.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
          the-face body.


          5.
           Horns strikes
           a He-man pose, his
           biceps in the
           wind.

           He removes the Police apparel,
           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.

   
          INT. RED


          EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          FISH
          How the fuck can I help you sir?


           SUPERHERO
          A room.
     

          

          6.
          His blood-shot eyes mean it.
          Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.

          FISH
          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
          (re: the check-in sheet)
          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles

          HANCOCK
          on the dotted line.
          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
          grab.

          FISH (CONT'D)
          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
          and I don't know you from Jack. You want
          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
          Plunger's extra.

          HANCOCK
          I need quiet. Is it quiet?

          FISH
          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
          library to you? The girls work. Some of
          them scream, some of them moan...

          (SMILES)
          and some of them just kinda lay there
          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.

          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
          under the window.

          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.

          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
          CLINKS off the counter.
          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
          complete with holster.

          Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
          by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
          He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
          A shoulder patch reads...

          U-RENT SECURITY CO.
          Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.

          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
          is rain.
          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
          interpretation of a man's weapon.
          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.

          HORUS
          How's the eye?

          AARON
          Black.
          Horus enters.
          Stands awkwardly before his son.

          HORUS
          It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
          up with some make-up and you won't even
          know it's there.

          AARON
          Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
          make-up on my face.
          Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.

          

          

          

          

          B.

          HORUS
          (almost apologetically)
          There'll always be people around
          who'll... exert force over those of us
          who just want to live in peace.
          Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (pain in every word)
          The thing to do is... to avoid them.
          They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
          anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
          (turns to Aaron)
          I tell you because I can't take it,
          seeing you hurt. You're part of me.

          (BEAT)
          I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
          you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
          feel what I felt-when you go up against
          one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
          do... the other cheek. You do that for
          me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
          No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
          I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
          I ask you to do that for me... your old
          man.
          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
          hallway - moved b y his affection.
          She oversees a father-son embrace.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          I'm late for work. Get some sleep.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          .after a good night sleep.
          The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
          room.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
          from behind.
          It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.

          HORUS
          Mary.

          

          

          

          

          9.
           Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles
          up against her husband.
           Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
          He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
           Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

          BY
          the moment.
          And out of nowhere...

          HORUS (CONT'D)

          (AWKWARD)
          I'm late.
          Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost
          expected it.

          MARY

          (DISAPPOINTED)
          Right.

          (BEAT)
          Coffee's by the door.
           She marches back into the kitchen. Horus stares at his feet.
          S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face.
           He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos. A
           look at Mary and he's out thedoo rt

           And while the storm rages outside, Mary burns in a feverish
          sweat. The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to
          saturate her chest and face - she drips.
           Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner
          longing.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM (7F) - NIGHT

          A T.V. SET. It MOANS from the corner of a room. Scant

          On a shredded s, blotched with urine and cum, we SEE a
          trenehc -lï¿½n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the
          picture.
          An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
          it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
          He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
          around him.
          Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
          dangling from the corner of his lip.
          We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
          a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.

          T.V. SET (O.S.)

          (FEMALE)
          Ooh yeah, big fella. That's it. Shoot

          (male; in ecstasy)
          fly. YES! G0000D!
          Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his
          face.
          He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
          deteriorates into ashes before our eyes.
          And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow.

          Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL (7F) - DAY

          An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts.
          A bed unslept. The TV is on, commercialing some spring-fresh
          vaginal wash. The room sits empty.
          But the bathroom door is open. Inside, the supersuit peeled down
          to his waist, Hancock shaves.

          HANCOCK
          (mumbling; rehearsing)
          it's about responsibility... with
          what is empowered in you... to correct
          the ills of man.
          No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE
          - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to
          sleep.

          On the tube, the commercial segues way into...

          T.V. (O.S.)

          TV Rips it from the wall, throws it out the window. And a CRASH
          eradicates images of war and chaos.

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY

          Behold this imposing, block-long behemoth of commerce and
          decadence. A shopper's wet dream, this is WATANABE'S SHOPPING

          EMPORIUM.
          From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
          come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
          As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
          Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
          Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
          swig from its hollow interior.

          ROHEIM
          I'll just play out the rest of this Eight
          Ball...
          He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries
          from his jacket.

          ROHEIM (CONT' D)
          (caps it)
          like that.
          Horus looks on - silent.

          

          

          

          

          14.
          A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front
          of them. The cops: RUTGER and ADAMS, two hairy-knuckled
          testosterone cases with nothing to do.

          RUTGER.
          (passenger seat)
          Boys...
          The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect
          between them. And they drive off.
          Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the

          "TO SERVE AND PROTECT"
          of their vehicle.
          Roheim watches him - turning red with drama.

          ROHEIM
          Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of
          warm spit... couldn't find their
          asshole with common sense and a thumb.

          (BEAT)
          Like I been saying, it's their.loss. The
          jerk-offs, they don't got the heart...
          the sensitivity of a man like you.
          Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like
          a thorn in the eye of his soul.

          ROHEIM (CONT'.D)

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel.
          A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only. We
          recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape,
          peering out from a hole in his coat.
          A cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen
          cigarette. He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so
          still.
          Something brews within this superman.

          The streets of Sheepshead: apartments, brownstones speckled with

          Through this hustle-bustle, we spot Mary and Aaron on their way

          TO

          BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

          Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying
          to pull ahead and away.

          MARY

          AARON
          I know it. I know it.

          MARY
          I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining
          weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.

          AARON
          What?

          MARY
          Is my dress too tight?

          AARON
          What? Nothing. It's fine.

          MARY
          Really, my waist isn't too big?

          AARON
          What? Not here, mom.

          AARON
          (there is no god)
          Geez!
          He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.

          Two-thirty.

          AARON
          All right, mom.
          He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.

          MARY
          (after him; in vain)
          You want anything from the store?
          He's gone.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          This is the Longfellow's street - lower-middle class but
          comfortable, quaint, safe. Mr. Longfellow, hustling through the
          street, takes us home.
          Greeting him at the entrance, at the mailboxes, is CLYDE BANNER
          (35). Quite large this tenant is, quite simply a Cro-Magnon Man.
          Clyde stands with the morning paper in hand, searching
          carelessly through. He finds the SPORTS PAGE. Hides it under his
          robe.

          Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.

          CLYDE
          Picked this up for you.
          (pulls the paper back)
          Say thanks.

          He heads inside.
          Horus swallowing it. He unshuffles the paper, finding the front
          page. The headline reads...

          RAINSTORM HITS SHEEPSHEAD. NO END IN SIGHT.
          Horus checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers
          inside.

          bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful.
          She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK.
          A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop.
          Mary continues forth, entering the bank.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Sheepshead DENIZENS crisscross amok. People queue behind teller
          lines, taking care of business.
          Mary takes her place. She glances at the bank CLOCK - it's 10
          o'clock.

          A BEE spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous ARM.
          This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank.
          The engine is running.
          The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it
          grips the wheel.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Same bank, same people. Mary awaits service in the same line.
          A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off
          the person in front, an elderly WOMAN.

          WOMAN
          Hey, what's the idea?
          The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal.
          grin. This man is TOM (35), as plainly evil as the eye can see.

          TOM
          You know what, you remind me of my
          grandma.
          Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants...

          Thanks, Granny!
          Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the
          situation at hand. They begin to panic.
          On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the
          crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES.
          Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun.
          As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each
          end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin.
          The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.
          The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with
          ,Irâº that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.

          He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the
          back, a BLONDE boy (8) sits chewing gum.
          This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt

          My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo...
          A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity.
          Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard,
          tumbles out and onto the sidewalk.
          Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered -
          he's probably dead.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          The cops, Ted., Chad. Rutger and Adams - they all REACT, guns
          raised.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom huddles by the entrance, gun smoking. Cool and suave has
          succumbed to psychotic. The Jerrys are nearby, nervous. As are
          the hostages, clumped together in fright.

          TOM

          (SNAPPED)
          I'm not gonna say it again, Ted!
          (re: hostages)
          swiss cheese. All of them!

          TED (O.S.)
          Time's running out, fellas!
          The hostages grimace, hell not so far away.

          TOM
          I want that car, Ted!

          Ted punches Chad on the shoulders.

          CHAD
          It's out getting your pizza.

          TOM (O.S.)
          . a car and I want it NOW!
          And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a
          CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance.
          It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
          Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps
          still reeling from the impact.
          The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED,
          the getaway driver (alias, the arm.) Fred lands on the hood of
          the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame.
          SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up.

          TED
          (at the sky)
          What the...

          

          

          

          

          25.
          There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He
          examines the ground below. And he dives.
          Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the
          bank structure, flying around and around.
          Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
          Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside
          subsides. Stops.
          A loaded beat.
          Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of
          bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the
          scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
          in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
          a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
          to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
          Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of
          steel.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into
          another awaiting police windshield.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes
          fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble.
          Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his
          frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect.
          Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out
          the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him.
          A heartbeat.

          HANCOCK

          (GOD)
          Everybody out, please.
          Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.

          

          

          

          

          26.
          Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped
          figure, until real estate ushers her into the street.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          PARAMEDICS converge on the hostages .
          The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights.
          They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars
          us to the back, where the bank SAFE is.
          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a
          thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe.
          Confronts the object inside - Tom.

          INT. BANK SAFE - DAY

          There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears
          his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe.

          TOM
          Stay away.
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm not going back.
          Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a
          resounding THUD. They're locked in.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (HYSTERICAL)
          What're you doing?
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          What's going on, here?
          Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          Answer me! Say something!

          (FIRES)
          Fuck me!

          

          

          

          

          27.
          BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET
          ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity.
          It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.

          HANCOCK
          (catching the renegade slug)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back,
          clutching his head. He bleeds.

          TOM
          Fuck... My shirt.

          HANCOCK
          (steps forward)
          Why don't we call it the day.

          TOM
          (gun raised)
          Don't. I told you... I'm not going back.

          HANCOCK

          (IRRITATED)
          If you're going to tease, cock the damn
          gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded
          animal act of desperation. I don't got c,
          time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't
          expect... dialogue and "come with me and
          you won't be hurt" bullshit. You walk out
          of here with me and your life is a
          violent storm. You will be hurt, you will
          be abused... whatever turns them on.
          Either way, your days are shit! Those are
          the realities, spelled out.

          TOM
          What's eating you, man?

          HANCOCK

          (UPSET)
          You got half the precinct out there,
          armed, trained to blow the tail off a
          sperm from a hundred yards... you're
          standing in here, cornered, three bullets
          left in that squirter of yours, if you're
          lucky, and you got one ear. I don't need
          the aggravation. I don't need this.

          TOM
          Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a
          rainbow...

          you don't got to shower me with respect.
          Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have
          you no mercy, mister?

          HANCOCK
          (he's had enough)
          I'm all out. Let's go...
          And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.

          TOM

          (HURT)
          Fuck you.
          Close on his trigger finger. It tightens...

          HANCOCK

          NO!

          INT. BANK - DAY

          On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear
          THREE SHOTS - from the safe.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to
          where we are.
          Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
          fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this
          sight - they eclipse the heavens.
          And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
           - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
          and ERLICK (both his age.)
          Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
          his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -
          the blonde kid from class.
          We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
          SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          The aftermath.
          Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing
          through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this
          superman.

          

          

          

          

          29.
          We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious
          Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to
          suck on his cape.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of
          tears. He rages down the street while his mother pursues.

          MARY
          Tell me... what happened?

          AARON
          (about to break)
          You were late.

          MARY
          I was held up...

          AARON
          The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.

          MARY
          .at the bank. Honey, were they the same
          ones? Don't cry.

          AARON
          Get a grip, mom.
          They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the
          stairs.

          EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying.
          Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by
          Horus, sleep still on his face.

          HORUS
          How was your day?
          Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.

          30.
          But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the
          top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised
          before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind.
          From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get
          him down.

          JUMPER'

          (SELF-PITY)
          People ignore me.
          From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his
          honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window
          across the street.

          FIREMAN
          Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          (through her teeth)
          You're not unattractive.

          FIREMAN
          Baldness is not fatal.

          JUMPER
          My wife ignores me.

          FIREMAN
          Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
          acknowledge you, we all do.

          JUMPER
          No.

          SECRETARY
          Yes.

          JUMPER
          Really?
          The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING
          across the street. The secretary points...

          EXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY

          There...

          

          

          

          

          31.
          on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen
          earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom.
          His mother's FREAKING from the window.
          Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
          gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his
          lonesome.
          The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
          dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
          Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
          On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
          the infant down.
          But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
          silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
          He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
          mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
          We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
          diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          An apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even

          bemoan the loss of...
          Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble
          and surfaces clean on the other side of the building.
          Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young
          WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety.

          We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening
          into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in
          her apron, Mary watches the news...

          NEWS
          . paramedics have taken the rescued
          tenants to County General for smoke

          We see FOOTAGE of the dramatic fire rescue: Hancock recovering
          tenants from the pyre - plebs and dwellers cheer in exaggerated
          astonishment.

          HORUS

          Why is he mad at me?

          (tapping the door)
          Let me see your eye...
          (to Mary)
          I told him about the other cheek. Avoid
          confrontations... to turn the other
          cheek.

          MARY
          .He did. He turned the other cheek and
          they punched it.

          MARY
          You're late. I'll try again later.
          Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her
          back to him. She's glued to the set.

          HORUS '
          How... what about you?

          MARY

          (ALOOF)
          What?
          Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE. He
          watches Mary.

          what I'd do... if you...
          Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She
          turns to face an empty room.

          INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light
          outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness.
          More intense it becomes.
          And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman,
          stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window.
          They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving
          pistons.
          For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's
          Veronica.

          VERONICA
          (a her voice trembles)
          Oh god.
          The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
          sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
          Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
          breasts beckoning at ceiling.
          Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the
          window. She paws after him.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his
          head.
          He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
          malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
          uniform, his gun.
          They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.
          The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel-
          belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.

          SCARPO
          Nutri-cop.
          Horus keeps walking.

          SCARPO (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Look like the Man. Walk like the Man.
          Shit, ain't half the Man.

          Ain't half the Man.
          Horus simply walks away.

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          A streetlight HUMS. Blinks - revealing a deserted alley in'
          sporadic intervals. Garbage, etc.
          A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful
          Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in
          solitude.

          

          

          

          

          35.
          He reaches behind his e. withdraws a box of cigarettes.
          Taps himself a stick.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          How about spreading some of that joy?
          Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own
          slimy kind of way.
          In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a
          gun to Hancock's temple.

          HOODLUM

          (PSYCHOTIC)
          Better yet, why don't I just take it...
          Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by
          the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.

          HANCOCK

          (SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
          What are you thinking?
          The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground -
          one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt.
          The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the
          pavement.

          HOODLUM
          (fuck me)
          Shit...

          HANCOCK
          What are you thinking?!
          Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own
          mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D )
          Huh?!
          Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the-
          Hoodlum's nose.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          Want to see brain? Huh?!
          Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.
          Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth.
          The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HOODLUM
          (with his mouth full)
          Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
          wife. I got student loans...
          Hancock - intense.
          Is this getting through?

          HOODLUM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          please. Have a heart, mister.
          Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state.
          He lowers the. Hoodlum.
          He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the
          Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          In the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in
          preparation for departure.
          A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with
          frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp
          amongst themselves.
          Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV -
          it's like he can't escape the good news.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The TV set.
          More news on the day's activities. Mary sits mesmerized on the
          sofa, holding a dish she had planned to dry.
          Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up
          behind Mary - his black eyes on the news.

          MARY

          (SURPRISED)
          You're still up.

          AARON
          Can't sleep.
          He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother.
          They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing
          Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this
          man.

          That's him?

          MARY
          There's something about him... I don't
          know.
          A female REPORTER concludes the footage...

          REPORTER

          (FAINTLY)
          And so we ask... who is this man?
          Speculation abounds - government super-
          experiment, an aberration of nature, or
          extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you?
          Where are you now, superguy? Call me.

          (SMILES)
          We'll get together. Have a drink.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          HADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town.
          NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
          to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
          We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
          hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
          water in Dixie cups.
          It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
          face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.

          HANCOCK

          (MUTTERING)
          What he's got to do... a man's got to do
          it.

          EXT. BAR - NIGHT

          Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
          above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
          We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
          peers into the alley.
          There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
          JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
          legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
          The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...

          

          

          

          

          38.
          A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
          violence.
          Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
          legs.
          A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
          other's eyes for answers.
          The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
          it into the light.

          WHORE
          (the sage)
          You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
          tired...

          (BEAT)
          and in need.
          Hancock - his eyes agree.
          The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes
          out a MATCHBOOK.
          Hands it to him.

          WHORE (CONY' D)
          My business card.
          (to the phone booth)
          My office.
          Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.

          HANCOCK

          Gina.

          WHORE

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
          side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
          into the trash cans below.
          Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
          against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
          He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
          the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
          up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
          He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than
          we think it deserves.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary swallows. Starts in on the tune.

          MARY

          There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens,
          as if he can hear.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Aaron, succumbing to his mother's song - his lids flutter.

          Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.
          A calm consumes him. Tames him. It could be Mary's voice - maybe
          he can hear it, and then maybe not.

          MARY (V.O.)
          "Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles
          awake you when you rise."
          Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.

          Erratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about.
          Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in
          flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors.
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They chase him from behind, HOOTING,
          taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood.
          Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          .. but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit. He
          swallows hard.
          FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood
          drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is
          there time?
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.

          Let's rock it up.
          They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
          the brick wall and a trash can.
          They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
          scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
          can.
          He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
          ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
          That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
          hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
          In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them
          away.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her

          A secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under
          his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands.
          Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man.
          Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his
          head. Disappointed.
          He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.

          HANCOCK
          You smoke?

          AARON
          What?

          Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.
          (beat; takes a puff)
          Smoke no evil.
          Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.

          Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't

          Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on
          it. Doubles over, coughing.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your
          first stick. Then, after a few more... it
          starts getting this. flavor. A little
          nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of
          a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only
          now, it takes a whole pack to get
          there.., and you won't settle till your,
          mouth's as sweet.

          Principles?

          HANCOCK
          Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
          about all you need to know: a man's got
          to do what a man's got to do.
          (beat; smokes)
          I look at your face, the shiners. You
          took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
          good. That's a formula for future
          abuse... an invitation to the loser's
          dance. Letting it go. Walking away.
          ,(shakes head)
          Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're
          running, looking for a place to hide.

          AARON
          What am I suppose to do?

          HANCOCK
          You do what is necessary.

          AARON
          I wanted... there were three of them.

          HANCOCK
          What is necessary.

          (HEAT)
          Let me tell you something, kid. There was
          this infantry unit, you see... badly
          outnumbered.
          (thinks about it)
          Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
          relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
          fox and he's walking through what, the
          woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
          fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
          hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
          chase, the fox's running his ass off,
          over boulders and through streams and,
          but the damn hounds are still on his
          tail. Finally the fox comes to this
          cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
          seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
          rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
          are closing in and they're going to tear
          him to pieces. So what does he think...
          "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
          confront them and I'll get my ass
          butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
          "stay and least I'd have something, a
          chance.

          To slip away, maybe." The fox decides to
          go down fighting, make a stand. Right?

          (BEAT)
          The hounds come. What do you think
          happens?

          AARON
          (thinking about it)
          He gets away.
          Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.

          HANCOCK
          No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
          some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
          like cheap fabric.

          AARON
          What're you saying?

          HANCOCK
          But you know, when the last hound was
          through with him,-and he's walking away,
          he hears this noise. It's the fox and
          he's muttering something under his
          breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
          up close. To hear what he's saying. You
          know what the fox's saying... just before
          he keels off?
          Aaron - negative.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Now he's gurgling, choking on his own 
          blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
          next to his entrails, you know... and you
          know what he says?
          (raises his fist in the air)
          "No regrets."

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          No regrets. You make a decision and you
          stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
          "no regrets."
          Aaron - submitting it to memory.

          AARON
          Why're you telling me all this?

          HANCOCK

          got to do.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Through the street darts Mary, eyes berserk in search for herher
          son. She looks at her watch. And up... up ahead, by steps
          apartment - Aaron, levitating in air.
          Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers
          Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother.
          She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms.
          She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear. Or
          possibly, they were awestruck.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus, in his bed - smothered in slumber.
          He begins to stir, wrestling some unseen dream. He wakes, in
          defeat.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Close on a TV set, featuring a COMMERCIAL - in mid-hype. A
          portly man states his purpose.
          His name tag reads - DR. HOLE.

          DR. HOLE
          at the Hole Institute, our
          experienced staff and cutting-edge
          technology means you need not spend
          another day in discomfort from
          hemorrhoidal flare-ups. Also, for anal
          fissures, warts, and secondary yeast
          infections, the institute is your
          complete rectal service clinic.

          And remember, I'm not just the Hole
          Institute spokesperson. I'm also a
          client.
          As Dr. Hole proceeds to exhibit an enlarged PHOTOGRAPH of his
          hemorrhoidal tissues, the TV channel changes. A NEWS program, in
          progress.

          

          

          

          

          46.
          On the living room sofa squats. Hancock, remote in hand.

          crowded market place in...
          Hancock staring into footages of bedlam, bloodshed. From the TV
          set, maternal CRIES spew forth grief and anguish.
          Hancock grabs the remote. Fumbles around for the power button.
          He pumps the volume instead - the WAILS intensify his state of
          panic, pain.
          CLICK. Mary - by the tube, switches off the mayhem. She studies
          his reaction, now marked with relief.

          MARY

          (SAVIOR)
          Are you OK?

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY

          (NERVOUS)
          I came in to... hope you like chicken.
          Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He
          continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping
          for dinner.
          She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there
          on her sofa.
          A calm, while they stare. And then...

          AARON (O:S.)
          Table's done.
          Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.

          MARY
          Glasses.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Geez.
          Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does
          not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          Mary stares at him. Aaron appears, also staring at him. Horus
          does a "what?" with his shoulders. Mother and son gesture behind
          him.
          He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm
          extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled.

          MARY
          You know Hancock?

          AARON
          He comes for dinner.
          Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.

          HANCOCK
          Man of the house?

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Dinner is served. All the key players, present. Horus sits
          facing his son - dethroned by the distinguished visitor. Mary
          serves.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          Which piece would you like?

          HANCOCK
          Breasts, please.
          Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.

          AARON
          You want milk?

          HANCOCK
          No. It gives me gas. Thank you.
          A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.

          AARON
          It makes mom fart, too.
          Mary CHOKES on her food.
          Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the
          utensil - and finding difficulty.
          Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and
          above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the
          above. She picks up the fork.

          looking impotent.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later.

          HANCOCK
          not about the labor... or the love of
          it.
          (beat; we've heard this before)
          .It's about responsibility... with what is
          empowered in you. The gift of might.
          Might to.do what? Exploitation, because
          you can? Or a different path. To purvey
          justice. To correct the ills of man...
          because I can.
          Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are
          charmed, his words secondary to his charisma.
          Horus, the quiet observer, observes.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about...
          essence. The essence of the man... not
          his clothes. It's the job. Take away the
          arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions
          but not his trade, his profession. That
          case, you strip him of what he is... a
          man.
          Horus a firm grasp of the concept.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          What line of work are you in, Mr.
          Longfellow?

          HORUS
          (clearing throat)
          Oh, it's not like you... what you do or
          anything. A department store over on
          Third.

          MARY
          Horus is in the securities business.

          HORUS
          I'm a security guard. I'm just...

          

          

          

          

          49.
          Aaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge.

          MARY
          It's a large department store, over a
          couple million in merchandise... stereos,
          jewelry. On three floors.

          HORUS
          It's a night job. I sit around.

          HANCOCK
          You're a security guard. You keep the
          state of things. It's a job. You do it.

          (PAUSE)
          We're in the same business.
          Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle.
          A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares
          at the BOTTLE.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Aaron, could you show me the restroom?
          Aaron points first door in the hall.

          AARON
          On the right.
          He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.

          AARON (CONT' D)
          What do you think, mom?

          MARY
          (in a whisper)
          Horus, what do I do?

          HORUS
          (at his watch)
          I need to get ready.

          AARON
          mom?

          MARY
          (to Horus)
          What do I do with him... when you're
          gone? I have to entertain this super...
          She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the
          participants.

          

          

          

          

          50.
          It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the
          surface tension.of water.
          LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of
          urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism
          from which it is generated.
          The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished
          faces - mouths agape.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later,. by a few minutes.

          HANCOCK
          (lost; sombre)
          and you could see the flames, through
          the storm... I get there, the vessel's
          all over, spread across three miles of
          South Pacific. Bodies floating in the
          water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some
          routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns
          out, the only one alive was the captain,
          up against a buoy... crying 'cause he
          didn't go down with his men... and he's
          got to live with it.

          (BEAT)
          Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard
          in a parking lot a couple months after. A
          good man...
          (at Aaron)
          . did what he had to do.
          A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's
          smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen, in the sink, stacks of plates indicate that
          dinner is through.
          Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of
          Horus. Aaron kneels besides Hancock. Mary, across from him.

          AARON
          (making a fist)
          I wanted to kill him.

          MARY
          Aaron.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          AARON
          I want to deck him, just once. So bad I
          tense up... like I can't even move.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          He comes home crying.

          AARON
          Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.

          HANCOCK

          (REACTS)
          No... there's no shame in it. The crying.
          It's relief...
          (to Mary)
          we're older and we don't remember
          when... we go, "God, when was the last
          time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an
          effort, now. Takes more pain... more
          blood. Like it's, do you have the time
          anymore? Even to look back and recall a
          moving experience. To be moved.

          (AARON)
          By rage. Hurt.

          (MARY)
          By love.

          (BEAT)
          But if you have to remember the last time
          something touched you... you've missed it
          - you've forgotten how to cry.
          Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this
          magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose
          nature he has yet to comprehend.
          Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door.
          Hancock - holds him accountable.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AWARE)
          Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.

          HORUS
          Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't
          want to interfere. I have work.

          MARY
          (the original sin)
          Oh, I forgot to make coffee.
          She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          HORUS
          It's all right, Mary. I'm late.

          MARY
          No, I'll make it right now.

          HORUS
          I don't have time. I'll grab some on the
          way. Thanks.
          Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I don't want to interrupt. Please don't
          let me stop you.

          HANCOCK
          No, I need to go.
          (at' Mary and only Mary)
          The last time I had a meal... an evening
          like this, I was... it was too long ago.
          I appreciate your kindness.

          MARY

          (AWKWARD)
          Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime.
          Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
          Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.

          HANCOCK
          Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll
          drop by after school. See how you're
          doing.

          AARON

          (SMILES)
          Yeah.
          Horus watches this - his son slipping away.
          The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first.
          Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and
          EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging
          wild.
          We just .don't know.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The two men appear from the entrance, shoulder to shoulder -
          sort of. They enter the street.

          HORUS

          (POINTING)
          I'm this way.
          Hancock points the opposite way.

          HANCOCK
          Need a lift?

          HORUS
          It's a short walk.
          Acknowledged.
          An awkward beat while they stare at each other...
          . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk
          and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight.
          From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
          into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.

          Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.

          MARY
          About him?

          AARON
          No. Not really. Are you?

          No.
          They're lying through their collective teeth.

          AARON
          Me neither. I was thinking.., about
          tomorrow.

          MARY
          Go to sleep. You know what dad says.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          I know, mom... after a good night sleep.
          He says that but he's the one working
          every night. Does that mean he never
          feels better? He's always feeling
          terrible?

          MARY

          (AMUSED)
          Go to bed, anyway.
          She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the
          door...

          AARON
          Mom?
          She turns.

          Time lapses into the late hours. This town experiences a serene

          will be.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not
          unlike a cemetery.
          All is dead, with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing
          linoleum. It's Horus, on duty. His flashlight leads the way...

          Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who can't come
          out to play.
          He turns to look across the floor - Roheim, against a chair,
          watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV

          It's dark out here in the night. On the roof. Overlooking the

          bedroom.
          From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She
          disrobes down to bare back...
          And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS
          into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back
          towards his face intense.

          the mist clears, thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
          JUNGLE. We penetrate the silence
          the silence, it fades into SONG - the silk, mellifluous
          voice of a woman (not unlike Mary's). Her siren call beckons
          us... takes us deeper into unknown greenery...
          but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to

          The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the

          Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.

          . that look on her face, you know the
          look, when she's almost there... makes
          you feel like a man.

          and it's not even me, my body. Some guy,

          so... the Marlboro Man's running his

          No.

          ROHEIM
          You're afraid to offend. You don't want

          You shouldn't drink.

          towards Mary.

          Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to
          mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks
          at Mary, reposed before him.

          HANCOCK

          How are you?

          page on the front steps.

          What were you doing in the street?
          (the trenchcoat)
          You ripped it pretty good.

          HANCOCK
          All right?

          MARY
          It's just the seams. I can sew it back.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          (the trenchcoat)
          This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good
          care of it.

          HANCOCK
          You'll sew -it?

          MARY
          Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for
          you, all right?
          Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven. Her
          eyes search the gray sky for signs of life.-
          There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and
          arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock.

          

          

          

          

          65.
          He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes
          and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.
          He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
          together tightly.

          MARY
          (like a little girl)
          Let's see.

          HANCOCK
          You have to be quick.

          MARY
          Come on, I want to see.

          HANCOCK
          If you blink, you'll miss it.
          Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
          something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
          moisture. It showers into his open hands.
          Mary reaches for it. Too late.

          MARY
          I saw it, right? A little cloud.
          She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
          And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
          Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
          touches his.
          He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
          her hand away.

          MARY (CONY' D)
          The water is dirty.

          HANCOCK

          MARY

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY
          (into his eyes)
          It's not your fault.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          Hancock looks away.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You're tense.

          HANCOCK
          I've been tired, lately.

          MARY
          You should slow down. Rest.

          HANCOCK
          -So people tell me.

          MARY
          (heat; upon some thought)
          It must be hard.

          HANCOCK
          Hard?

          MARY
          To always do right... do good when all
          you want to do is rest.

          HANCOCK
          It's harder to not do anything. What am
          I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
          about people. Rest? When there is
          despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
          relief. You know that instant, that split
          instant of time when you realize that the
          nightmare... the totality of fear
          itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
          That it's safe? That is relief. The
          infant in my arms... to the hysterical
          mother. When you can see her face, what's
          rest? It is self-indulgence.
          Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."

          MARY
          Where... who are you?

          HANCOCK
          It's not important who I am, Mary. Or
          what... where I'm from. It doesn't
          matter. I'm a man. I am every man.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          MARY
          (sizing up his words)
          You probably get a lot of practice
          explaining yourself, on account of who
          you are and what you do.

          HANCOCK
          Why... do you say that?

          MARY
          It's like, everything you say sounds...
          so perfect. Like you rehearse them so
          they'll be that way. I mean, not to say
          that it's insincere...

          (BEAT)
          I mean, maybe it's something about you
          but... it must be hard on you sometimes.
          Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (APOLOGETIC)
          But probably not... probably..

          HANCOCK
          Yes...
          (pulling teeth)
          sometimes.
          Mary allows the moment to sink in.

          MARY
          So, you never answered. Back there...
          what were you doing in the middle of the
          street?

          HANCOCK

          (THINKS)
          I was lost...

          (EXHALES)
          . but I think I'm ok, now.

          to his liking.

          

          

          

          

          68.
          Erlick. Spengler. They zoom by and with great eagerness.
          Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
          From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
          relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
          takes.

          AARON

          (HANCOCK)
          " before long, you're running, looking
          for a place to hide."

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

          PERCEVAL
          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
          my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
          eyes are of disbelief.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          What's up?
          (checks his hair)
          What?
          Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
          with clenched fists.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          (rolls up sleeves)
          I just combed my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Don't bother. He's mine.
          (to Aaron)
          No biting. I hate biting.

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.

          ERLICK

          (OVERLAPPING)
          Do him, Percy. He's your woman.

          

          

          

          

          69.

          PERCEVAL
          Let's go. Let's have it. While we're
          still kids.
          Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent
          little gonad.

          (BEAT)
          Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny,
          purple-headed shlongs the size of...
          All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose.
          And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
          BLOWS to the face and body.
          Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
          left and right...

          ERLICK
          He's yours.

          SPENGLER
          Save some for us.
          Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine.
          Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
          He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
          recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
          He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
          into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
          fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
          Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
          ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.

          ERLICK
          What's he doing?

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.
          Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
          fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
          revenge presents itself.

          ERLICK
          That's cold.

          

          

          

          

          ?0.

          SPENGLER
          Kill him, Percy.
          Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
          orifice. Contemplates his target.
          Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
          ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.

          AARON
          (to the boys)
          Don't mess with me.
          He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline
          taking him away.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
          to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
          Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
          watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
          Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
          reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
          staring,.

          MARY
          You're still up?
          She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.

          HORUS
          Just get in?
          Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
          attire. She nods affirmatively.

          MARY
          Nick's market. Are you sick?

          HORUS
          I can't sleep.
          She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms
          her own with the left, as reference.
          Horus tilts his head away from her hand.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          Please, Mary.

          MARY
          You want some milk? I'll heat it up for
          you, how about that?

          HORUS
          No thank you.

          (BEAT)
          Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up

          MARY
          Yes, he is.
          He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
          dressing - oblivious.

          HORUS
          He'll take him home?

          MARY
          Yes.

          HORUS
          What do we know about this man? The
          papers... they don't have all the facts
          about him.

          MARY
          What facts? He's not a hero.

          HORUS
          Yes. A hero. I know that...

          MARY
          Aaron likes him.

          HORUS

          (TIMID)
          I know that maybe, I've been
          neglectful... that I haven't been
          there...
          Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (SERIOUSLY)
          I'm trying... you have to know... I'd
          like to be more... involved. Like it used
          to be. Before we moved here.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          72.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (notices Mary, applying

          LIPSTICK)
          Are you going somewhere?

          MARY
          No. I have to start on dinner. So how
          about that glass of milk?
          Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          All right. Try to get some sleep.
          With that, she's out the door.
          Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his
          wretched face.
          He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside
          - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
          Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the
          cover.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Aaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his
          apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a
          cigarette smolders from his lips..
          Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
          And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron,
          triumphant, SMACKS it for five.

          CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The dinner table. Post meal. Mid-digestion. Aaron is running off
          at the mouth.

          AARON
          .o his mouth was. open and he just stared
          up at me, it hurt that bad.
          And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair -
          a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.

          AARON (CONTD.)

          (CONTINUING)
          I said, "don't mess with me." Just like
          that.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          73.

          AARON (CONT'D)
          "Don't mess with me." Mom, remember that
          guy in the cop movie... he said that?

          MARY
          All right, already. How's your mouth?

          AARON
          It doesn't hurt, I told you.

          (CONTINUING)
          He saw everything from the roof. Said I
          did what I had to do.

          HORUS

          (FINALLY)
          Aaron, tomorrow...

          AARON
          (to Mary; oblivious)
          He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up
          again...

          HORUS
          I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I
          pick you.

          AARON
          God, my friends will freak.
          Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work.
          A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the
          shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern
          and proud.
          Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet
          door.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron,
          mother giving son a HAIRCUT.

          MARY
          Hold still.

          AARON
          I like it long.

          MARY
          Shut up.

          

          

          

          

          74.
          Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his
          wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't
          realize he's there.
          Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Horus?

          AARON
          it's almost eight. Dad's late.

          MARY
          Horus?
          She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the
          bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into
          the stairway outside.
          There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
          up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary
          is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP.

          AARON
          like this?
          (holds up hand)
          How do you make a fist?

          MARY
          (grabs his head)
          Aaron, hold it.
          Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes.
          So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and
          bones. It SNARLS at Aaron.
          Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't
          let go of them.
          Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
          him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Hancock?
          The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          MARY (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING
          ) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          Your hair. Come on, have a seat.

          AARON
          Mom's going butcher your hair.

          MARY
          Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n
          homework.

          AARON
          Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
          Hancock.
          Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."

          AARON (CONT' D)
          Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I
          got to do.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
          fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
          him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
          Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
          her presence. Baffled.
          From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
          sweater.
          And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
          of their breaths.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Hancock.
          Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
          he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.

          MARY
          There... my hero.
          He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          How do you like it?

          HANCOCK
          Nice. Thank you.
          Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...

          MARY
          I started out just trimming for Horus.
          Here and there. He had to look just right
          for the academy, says his father, a
          police captain there... in Philly. When
          we moved here, I pretty much took over as
          the resident barber. You know, to save
          some money.

          HANCOCK
          He was in the-police academy?
          A pause.

          MARY
          His father's idea. Not his. He went
          through it anyway, like he had something
          to prove... the validation of his
          manhood.

          (BEAT)
          It tpok everything out of him. He didn't
          talk for days after he was cut. He took
          it real hard. I mean, still, he's not...
          I mean,, he's still...
          (edits herself)
          .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I
          understand that I'm not intolerant of it,
          the working-through process. It's just
          that, sometimes...
          (at Hancock)
          sometimes, I need his strength. I
          miss. the strength.

          HANCOCK
          Is that what you want?

          MARY
          Want?

          HANCOCK
          What you need?

          MARY
          The hair... I need to...

          

          

          

          

          77.
          She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.

          HANCOCK
          Mary?

          MARY
          Yes?

          HANCOCK

          (BEAT)
          You ever been down the boardwalk, at
          night?

          MARY
          Why... what for?
          They're eye to eye. Close.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Mom?
          Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
          in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.

          MARY
          Yes.
          Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!

          AARON
          my mouth. It's starting to swell. I
          think he loosened a tooth.
          Mary - maternal duty calls.

          MARY
          All right. Go to your room. I'll get the
          ice pack.
          Aaron exits. Mary exits.
          Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for
          the front door.
          Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...

          MARY (CONT' D)
          You're leaving?

          HANCOCK
          It's getting late.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          HANCOCK
          I'm going to take a walk.

          MARY
          Really? On the boardwalk?

          HANCOCK
          Maybe.
          Pause.

           AARON (O.S.)
          Mom.'

           MARY
          I'm sorry.
          She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he
          stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.

          HANCOCK

          (FINALLY)
          Good night, Mary.

          MARY
          Good night.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock - 9:45 pm.
          The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
          door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
          peers out at the street - no Roheim.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
          marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
          She mingles with a BAR FLY.
          Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
          From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.
          Whispers to him.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          MAN
          I wear dresses. How about you?

          HANCOCK
          (considers; nah)
          Get lost.
          The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
          Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
          bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.

          GINA
          (to bar fly)
          Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
          The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
          in her hands, studies him.

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Your eyes are calm. It's good.
          She withdraws her hands.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          GINA
          But you're still here.
          She rises. And as she makes for the exit...

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Nice haircut.
          Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the
          rest of his cigarette - pensive.

           INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock, it reads 1:05 am.
          Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine
          takes him outside - via an EXIT door.

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes.
          Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the
          street.:.

          . as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's
          been drinking, right?

          HORUS
          Dear God.
          Horus catches him.

          INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT

          They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
          light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
          bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
          A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.

          HORUS
          Jesus.
          Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
          nurse' the wounds.

          ROHEIM
          Figured I can get you by the front... but
          you weren't there.

          HORUS
          (dabbing the torn lip)
          Who... what happened?

          ROHEIM
          They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and
          his boys. They were waiting on me.
          Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.

          HORUS
          Why didn't you come through the back...
          standing out there in the dark?

          ROHEIM
          -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped
          them'in the fight.
          (feels his lip)
          Shit...
          He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.

          HORUS
          What're you doing?

          

          

          

          

          81.

          ROHEIM
          (into the mirror)
          the old man
          Look at what they did.. gave
          a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for
          shit.

          HORUS

          (FRUSTRATION)
          Sit down
          Could you knock it off, please.
          so I can clean the cuts.
          He leads the old wretch back to the chair.

          ROHEIM
          I'm a waste of time...

          HORUS
          Stop.

          ROHEIM
          I'm too old for this.

          HORUS
          You're not old.

          ROHEIM
          What am I... I'm biologically challenged.
          Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.

          (BEAT)

          I
           Use to be, I blame the job. The job.
           think, bullshit job. Not right for a man.
           "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for
           the hell is DIo nly
           dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn
           reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the
          carpet.
          Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But you know what, Horus. That's all
          wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't
          make the man. It's me. Not the uniform.
          It starts right here... 'cause I can't do
          anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.
          (a beat; at Horus)
          But you. Why do you put up with this
          crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for
          you at home.
          Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a
          Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess.

          HANCOCK
          got to do what you got to do.
          He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other
          hand. We sense a decision brewing...

          INT. THE LONGFELLOW BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A desk clock points to 2:30 am.
          Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns...
          A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in
          the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket.
          What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-
          gravity. He stares directly at her.

          HANCOCK
          I know you're up, Mary. I know you can
          hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk
          tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's
          important that I talk to y ou, then.

          (GRAVELY)
          Please, Mary.
          And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up
          the stairs.

          ROHEIM
          They're going to can me.

          HORUS
          No one's canning anyone. No one saw us...
          watch your step... leave.

          ROHEIM
          Should be an extra key over the door.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something
          is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the
          machinery.
          Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes
          back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.

          AARON
          The toast's burnt.

          MARY
          What?
          Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.

          AARON
          We're late... you forgot the corn chips.
          Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
          over the place.

          MARY
          Eat... and we'll go.
          (checks her watch)
          Where's your father?
          She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.

          AARON
          You forgot the corn...
          (the comb snags)
          . ouch!

          MARY
          I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll
          be home before we leave. I'm sorry.

          AARON
          You having your period, mom?
          She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room.
          Horus ushers Roheim in...

          ROHEIM
          Shoes.
          The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under.

          HORUS
          You're going to be okay?

          ROHEIM
          I don't know. You might have solo act
          tomorrow night.

          HORUS
          Get some sleep.

          ROHEIM
          You're a good man, Horus.

          HORUS
          (washing over it)
          I have to get home, now. I'll call.
          Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.

          ROHEIM
          You know what Olga said before she walked
          out on me? Her last words to me. She
          turned at the front door. Looked around
          the room and she says, "keep it clean."
          That's it, can you believe it? Then out
          the door.

          (BEAT)
          But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place
          spotless... in case she walks through
          that door one day.
          (at Horus; with pain)
          I don't think she's coming back.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger,
          despair, a combination thereof.
          He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands,
          pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.
          Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in.
          On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies
          down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red.

          

          

          

          

          85.
          He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand.
          KNOCK. And again, KNOCK.
          ï¿½ow
          He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
          second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung.
          The door opens.
          And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with
          one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other.
          Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.

          CLYDE
          The box scores are waiting and I got an
          inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make
          it snappy.

          HORUS
          (loosing his voice)
          I'd like my sports page, please.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          I want you to stop taking my sports page.

          CLYDE
          All right.
          Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck.
          He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...

           CLYDE (CONT' D)

           (AGITATED)
           What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop
           taking your sports page. Now get out of
          here and let me...

          HORUS

          (INTERRUPTS)
          I want today's sports page.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          That there... my sports page.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          CLYDE
          What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden?
          You don't even like football.
          Horus does.not budge.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You'll get it back... after I take my
          dump.
          Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
          foot in the door.

          HORUS
          No.

          CLYDE
          What?

          HORUS
          No. I would like my sports page now.
          Please.

          CLYDE
          After I finish.

          HORUS
          I'd prefer it now.

          CLYDE
          What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
          Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
          a kamikaze move, indeed.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (SHOCKED)
          Give that back.
          Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
          midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
          massacre commences.
          He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
          across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
          Horns accepted it as fate.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning,
          returns to his room.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
          Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
          far away place.

          AARON
          Are you all right, mom?

          MARY

          (DISTRACTED)
          Yeah... why?

          You're acting weird.

          (didn't hear)
          What?

          AARON
          I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think
          it's time for your nap.
          Aaron leaves.
          Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
          disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.

          HORUS
          Mary!
          A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
          apartment.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
          muffled volume.
          Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
          cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
          while, one would suspect.

          In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.
          The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock. The cop
          follows suit, passing by.

          COP (CONT'D)
          Stop him!
           Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.

          EXT..STREET - DAY

           Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
          corner BAR.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
          swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
          Horus enters. Finds a stool.

          HORUS
          Drink.
          The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Is this a bar... or what? Drink.
          (uncomfortable with his own

          RUDENESS)
          Please.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
          It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
          clouds - they're alive, restless.
          She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.

          HANCOCK
          Hi.

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Thank you for being here.

          (constipated; following some

          THOUGHT)
          It's cold.
          Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (at the clouds)
          They're moving. The turbulence has
          started.

          MARY
          Tell me what's wrong.
          He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
          darkness.

          HANCOCK
          Look out there and what do you see, Mary?

          MARY

          (PERPLEXED)
          Nothing. I don't know... I don't see
          anything.

          HANCOCK
          see it,can
           It's out there. But you can't
          Y nu?
          (beat; holding on to a thread)
          And that's good, not seeing. But for me,
          I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out
          there.

          MARY
          Please, Hancock. What are you talking
          about? What's out there?

          You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you.
          He'll say: "you do what you have to do."
          Or what? You let the next guy do it for
          you, if you don't... if you can't.
          (losing it)
          And... but. If I can't, then who?

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          The next guy? No. There is no "I can't."
          Just "I must."
          Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't
          question it. This is me. I'm it. I do
          what I have to do. I get in there.., all
          the killing... the blood... and I deal
          with it. I clean up. I make things right.

          (BEAT)
          And. But when.., where does it end?
          (re: his cape)
          Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's
          everywhere. And it stays. All that I can
          do, Mary. The things I am capable of
          doing, I can't blink away the hell I've
          seen. It's in me...
          (points to his head)
          in here and I can't not think about
          it. It's in me. It's me.

          MARY
          Hancock... what...

          HANCOCK
          I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll
          break. I need to get away. Get away to
          where? I don't know.
          (at Mary)
          I need your help.

          MARY
          Me? What can I do?
          (she's helpless)
          What do you want me to do?

          HANCOCK
          I want you to save me.

          MARY
          How?
          Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
          Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
          her senses, pulls away.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Don ' t.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPERATE)
          Save me.

          MARY
          I can't.

          HANCOCK
          You can.
          (the hard sell)

          AND
          Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron.
          what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An
          apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't
          know what I'm doing... what I'm saying
          anymore.

          MARY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          I'm married.
          A pause.

          HANCOCK
          To whom?

          MARY
          I love him.
          The death blow.

          HANCOCK
          No.
          (turns from her)
          Unacceptable.

          MARY
          I love him. I'm sorry.
          One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this
          superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel.
          Mary wants to console... but what can she do?

          HANCOCK
          I'm cold.
          Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          She leaves.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
          indicating that class is in session.
          He swings into the BOYS ROOM.

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
          Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
          Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...

          PLOP.
          And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles
          surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see
          but, from behind, the stall door opens...
          Guess who?
          Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
          Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
          SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
          next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
          shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
          What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
          laughter.
          The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...

          THEM

          (MOCKINGLY)
          "Don't mess with me."
          They leave - laughing.

          THEM (CONT'D)
          (in the distant)
          Little shit.
          Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl.
          On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing
          wild.
          She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
          Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.

          MARY
          Horus...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released
          from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and
          soiled in disgrace.
          He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No
          Hancock, anywhere.
          Aaron waits, hopeful.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
          his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
          in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
          upper branches of a tree.

          SUE
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Hymie. Come down, Hymie.
          She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.

          SUE (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the
          tree.
          Hancock's reaction - "what?"

          SUE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          My pussycat. She won't come down.
          She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent
          eyes.

          

          

          

          

          94.
          So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his
          palm. Finds the little pussy named Hymie. And with a simple
          flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
          A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
          limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.

          SUE (CONT'D)
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Holy fuck.
          Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.

          EXT. SKY - DAY

          Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
          BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,
          plummeting downward with the dislocated debris.
          He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks
          h er watch.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The place is empty. Deserted.
          Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face
          - the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.
          He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only
          to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
          We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
          stiff up his ass.

          REED
          What do we have here? A piece of shit.
          A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that
          superguy.
          Hancock stares at him.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          HANCOCK

          (HUMORLESS)
          Fuck off.
          He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.

          EXT. STREET - DAY


          A
          Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
          particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
          chase... and confronts him, out of breath.

          AARON
          (a slight smile)
          Hi.

          HANCOCK
          (turning; drunk)
          What're you doing here?

          AARON
          (the smile fades)
          I saw you walking. Where were you today?
          You said you'd... be there.
          Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.

          HANCOCK
          I don't know what you're talking about.

          AARON
          Where are you going? Can I go?

          HANCOCK
          You don't want to go where I'm going.

          AARON
          Those assholes got me in the bathroom,
          today...
          (trying to hold on)
          and you said you'd pick me up at
          school.
          Hancock turns. He's upset now.

          HANCOCK
          Listen.
          Aaron recoils.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Listen. I'm not here to save you.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          No, not my job. Don't put that on me.
          (pounds his chest)
          Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal
          with it, kid. You are what you are and...
          what I say, it won't do you any change.
          You'll grow up to be just like-your old
          man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can
          do about it... 'cept grab both ankles,
          hope by the grace of God the reaming's
          gentle.
          Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not
          here to save you.
          He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed
          against the rocks.
          In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          This empty bar.
          With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's
          drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30).

          HORUS

          (BOOZED)
          One.more.
          Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          No... nevermind.
          (going to blow)
          Where's your bathroom?

          JOEY
          (not in my place)
          Bathroom's closed.
          Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.

          HORUS
          How much.

           JOEY

          (SARCASM)
          Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you
          what. I'll take care of this one.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          HORUS
          Thank you.

          JOEY
          The register ain't open yet, anyhow.
          Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
          for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.

          JOEY (CONT'D)
          Shit.

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          In the armpit of town - Hancock. He lights a cigarette with the
          matchbook Gina had given him earlier.
          At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all
          her glory.

          GINA
          I've been waiting.
          They stare for one horny beat.
          Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
          for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.

          \./

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The front door opens, but slowly. Aaron steps inside.
          From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition. He
          sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs
          s obbing into her arms.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          A phone booth - Gina's office.
          There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
          Gina, their organs ensnared. They're pumping away. Up. Down.
          A surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of
          her leather.

          GINA
          Come on, baby. Relax.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          GINA
          You can.
          The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          GINA
          Let it go, baby. Just let it...

          RING...

          HANCOCK
          (in tears)
          I can't.
          His arm rips through the glass...

          GINA
          . go.

          (ORGASMS)
          Oh god.

          HANCOCK
          I can't!

          RING...
          He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'

          GINA
          Don't give up, now.
          He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - NIGHT

          There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and
          grooves in clouds once coy and demure. The wind HUMS its
          presence, toys with fallen leaves.

          'INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          It's dinner - but all is not well. Mary and Aaron and an empty
          chair. '
          They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound.
          Between them - a ketchup bottle.
          The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
          and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          HORUS
          (on the ground; prone)
          Son. Go to your room.
          Struggles to his knees.

          MARY
          What happened toyou?

          AARON
          Dad, are you wasted?

          MARY
          Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to
          your room.

          AARON
          He is wasted.
          Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.
          When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.

          HORUS
          Aaron. Go to your room.

          AARON
          But dad...

          MARY

          (AUTHORITY)
          Go!
          Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          What do you think you're doing, Horus
          Longfellow?
          Horus gauges her.

          HORUS
          Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm
          not your child. I'm your husband.

          MARY
          Horus, what're you talking about?
          (re: bruises)
          Who did this to your face?
          Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          HORUS

          (OBLIVIOUS)
          But you didn't know-about me...
          Mary knows where this is headed.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You didn't know I was going to do this to
          you.
          (a half-chuckle)
          I guess I should've known. We were
          married and I knew... at the reception. I
          couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and
          watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and
          I watched you dance. In your white dress.
          And I remember zoning out... for a
          second, just watching you. God, Mary...
          the little girl next door who used to get
          into fist fights with her brothers in
          those patched-up Toughskins. We met only
          'cause the tallest tree in the
          neighborhood was in my backyard and you
          needed to climb it.

          (BEAT)
          But that night. God, you looked so
          beautiful I.had to realize it... how much
          I loved you... one more time.

          (BEAT)
          You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I
          remember I'm watching you there, with
          him... together like that. You looked
          good with him, I thought all of a sudden.
          Like you belong... better. And as I
          stared across the floor, it was the same
          story with all the guys there, that they
          were more right for you.

          Hancock's POV: a burning hallway, flames spewing from every
          crevice - we're walking through Hell.
          We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his cape
          around him. Bolts through the inferno... as glass SHATTERS...
          and gas pipes ERUPT.
          He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape... only to see the

          She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV
          reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the

          Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed
          against wood - listening.
          So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a

          No! Mom!

          heavy on his head.

          Scarpo - in full alert. He's heard the commotion upstairs.

          SCARPO
          Guys?
          (no answer)
          Fuck me.
          He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun.

          INT. ELECTRONICS SECTION - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT,

          Thug #1, he's writhing to music under the privacy of headphones -
          unaware of Horus behind him... Thug #1 whirls around with a gun,
          catching Horus off guard.
          Horus responds with a FLASH he had acquired from the camera
          section - the burst of light momentarily blinds the thug.
          And a quick SNAP of the bat takes out Thug #1. Horus dispenses
          of the camera, his adrenaline raging. He commandeers the free
          gun, heads downstairs.
          But the TV stops him... it displays the siege at Killybegs
          Textiles.

          REPORTER
          again, we believe that this is a
          hostage situation. Officials refuse to
          comment but we believe Hancock has
          abducted a woman, the identity of whom we
          do not yet know...
          Horus - a look of horror on his face.

          He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his
          way down to the second floor... where he is greeted by a gun
          NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.

          SCARPO

          He pushes Horus down the remaining steps.

          Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops.
           Horus goes for the gun. A struggle ensues, Scarpo finding Horus to the side.

          He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of
          healing.
          Hancock closes in - corners her.

          MARY
          Please.
          But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his

          thing they can do, and it's worthless.
          And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance.
          First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and
          RIPS the vehicle in half.
          An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning

          Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building.
          From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble,
          heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body -
          belonging to Adams.
          A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun
          and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes
          that no revolver will do. He continues forth.

          And he gets it... as Hancock, once again, emerges from the
          building - fire in his eyes.

          HANCOCK
          You ready to rock it up?
          Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock
          follows, toying with the man.
          Horus disappears inside.

          Horus answers...
          He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
          He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS
          Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the
          brick structure.

          HORUS
          Fuck you.
          Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He
          GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.
          Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
          EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
          loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.
          CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does
          not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the
          street.
          Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus
          - grabbing him by the collar.
          With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying.
          THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the
          asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.

          Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking
          pale.
          Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to
          excavate his wife - one brick at a time.

          Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.
          Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He
          r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.
          Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his
          midst... surveys the carnage...
          A loaded beat.
          Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.
          Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
          knees... by a fallen police GUN.

          He picks it up...
          points it at his head...

           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
          off skull.
          Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet
          tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a
          surreal sight.
          Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works
          his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.

CUT TO INT.

SCHOOL FRENCH CLASS - MORNINGClass 3A are in the midst of a French lesson. All the class have name cards hanging around their necks denoting their chosen "French name." MISS WALLER gestures at a screed of subjugated verbs scrawled on the blackboard.

MISS WALLER The imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past. "II voulait qu'elle lui donnat de l'argent." Translate, somebody . . . quickly!

A SCHOOLGIRL - LAURA - blurts out from the front of the class.

LAURA 
"He wanted her to give him some money."

MISS WALLER 
(Angry) Put your hand up! I will not have girls talking out of turn in my class!

The door opens and Miss Stewart brings Juliet into the room.

The presence of the headmistress causes the class to stand up.

MISS STEWART
Good morning, gels.

CLASS (In Unison) Good morning, Miss Stewart.

The class sit.

MISS STEWART
Miss Waller . . . class . . . this is Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay.

Juliet looks at Miss Stewart haughtily.

JULIET
I am actually from England, Miss Stewart.

MISS STEWART
Of course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University.

Miss Waller looks impressed. Pauline is quietly drawing horses at the back of the class.

MISS STEWART
Juliet's travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet.

Miss Stewart leaves. Miss Waller smiles at Juliet.

MISS WALLER 
You can sit over here, Juliet.

Miss Waller gestures to a desk at the front. She gives Juliet a cardboard name card.

MISS WALLER 
We use French names in this class. You can choose your own.

Miss Waller returns to the blackboard and starts writing.

MISS WALLER 
Now, irregular verbs in the present subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .

JULIET
Excuse me, Miss Waller . . . you've made a mistake.

Miss Waller turns to Juliet-who now has the name "Antoinette" hanging around her neck.

JULIET
"Je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive.

MISS WALLER 
It is customary to stand when addressing a teacher . . . "Antoinette."

Juliet stands.

JULIET
You should have written "vint."

Miss Waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs out the offending word.

MISS WALLER 
(Embarrassed mumble) Oh! I must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.

Juliet stands again.

JULIET
You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of it.

Miss Waller turns to Juliet, her face clouded with anger. The class looks terrified.

MISS WALLER 
(Icily) Thank you, Juliet. Open your text-book to page 17.

Pauline is smirking.

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL ART CLASS - DAY
The teacher, MRS. COLLINS, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints. She starts to distribute them around the tables.

MRS. COLLINS 
Right, I thought we'd do some life drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw.

The girls around Juliet turn to each other, seemingly eager not to be partnered with her. They pair off and Juliet is left alone.

MRS. COLLINS 
Oh, Juliet. . . you haven't got a partner.

JULIET
That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can manage without one.

Mrs. Collins scans the class.

MRS. COLLINS 
Pauline . . . are you with anybody?

Pauline shakes her head.

MRS. COLLINS 
Good! You can come here and pair up with Juliet.

Pauline reluctantly comes up to Juliet's table.

SERIES of SHOTS showing VARIOUS GIRLS sketching their partners. Most of the posing girls are seated in contrived positions with rigid grins on their faces. Mrs. Collins patrols the class, commenting to different girls.

MRS. COLLINS 
You might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker . . . that's very nice, Joan.

PULL BACK. . . to reveal Pauline's "pose" . . . slumped in the chair, arms crossed, a sullen look on her face. She stares intently at Juliet, who is drawing furiously . . . but doesn't refer to Pauline at all.

MRS. COLLINS 
Good heavens, Juliet! What on earth is this???

Mrs. Collins picks up Juliet's drawing. It features an armoured knight on horseback, fighting a dragon.

JULIET
St. George and the Dragon.

Mrs. Collins studies the detail in the drawing.

MRS. COLLINS 
Where's Pauline?

JULIET
Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out room.

Juliet glances at Pauline.

JULIET
Sorry! I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs. Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!

MRS. COLLINS 
Yes, I know it's very clever, Juliet, but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now put that down and start again!

Mrs. Collins moves on. Juliet looks up at Pauline rather grumpily. Pauline leans forward, an intense look on face . . .

PAULINE
(Whispers) I think your drawing's fantastic!

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/KITCHEN - EVENINGCLOSE-UP . . . a newspaper is unwrapped, revealing couple of fresh fish.

HONORA RIEPER is standing at her sink bench. She is 43 years old. Dark hair, going gray. A middle-aged woman with a kind face.

Her husband, HERBERT, has just arrived home and is taking off his coat, looking at the mail, etc. He is nearly 60 . . . 15 years older than Honora.

The Riepers' house is clean and tidy. They are a low middle-class family on a modest income.

HONORA 
Oh! . . . Mackerel. We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.

Herbert comes up behind Honora, gives her a peck on cheek and puts his hand on her bum.

HERBERT 
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?

HONORA 
playfully shoves his hand away.

HONORA 
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

HERBERT 
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.

young student boarder, STEVE BAYLISS, appears in doorway, nervously clutching a record.

STEVE 
Excuse me . . . would you mind if I put my long-playing record on?

HERBERT 
You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, STEVE?

STEVE 
 Well . . . actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.

HONORA 
glances at his album.

HONORA 
You have been splashing out!

STEVE 
 Oh! . . . I've got my board money . . .

STEVE 
 starts fishing in his pockets.

At this moment . . . Pauline comes into the kitchen, through back door. She strides past Honora, HERBERT and STEVE 
.

PAULINE
(Brightly) Hello!

HONORA 
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?

Pauline disappears into the lounge.

PAULINE
(O.S.) (Calling) Got an A, Mum!

HONORA 
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.

HONORA 
Don't worry about it now. We'll sort it out after dinner. You go put your record on.

HERBERT 
Doris Day!

STEVE 
 I think she's very talented!

INT. RIEPERS'HOUSE/LOUNGE - EVENINGCLOSE-UP. . . gramophone needle drops onto a record.

FAST PULL-BACK . . . from the speaker as the opening notes of "Be My Love" by Mario Lanza burst out. Records from the cabinet lie scattered on the floor. Pauline is clutching a Mario Lanza album.

STEVE backs toward the hallway door, holding his Doris Day album forlornly.

HERBERT chuckles at him through the kitchen doorway.

HERBERT 
(Laughing) Ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!

Pauline stares misty-eyed at the album cover. HERBERT 
calls out.

HERBERT 
(O.S.) (Tongue in cheek) Hey! Isn't it that Irish singer . . . Murray O' Lanza?

PAULINE
(annoyed) He's Italian, Dad! The world's greatest tenor!

Mario Lanza starts singing . . . HERBERT comes into the lounge, miming the song with a limp fish. He gesticulates a grand operatic fashion.

PAULINE
Stop it! You're spoiling it! Go away!

She pushes HERBERT out of the room, into the kitchen.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
It is the Phys Ed period and the 31 other girls of 3A are lying on their backs in the quad doing leg stretches to tinny music. MRS. ZWARTZ, the teacher, is patrolling the rows of flexing bodies.

MRS. ZWARTZ Left, right . . . Ieft, right . . . one and two and one and . . .

Pauline and Juliet are sidelined on a bench. Pauline is writing in a textbook. She notices Juliet glancing at her leg. Juliet moves closer.

JULIET
Can I have another look?

Pauline purses her lips and quickly pushes her left stocking down . . . She has a large ugly scar running up her left shin, from ankle to knee.

JULIET
That's so impressive!

Pauline does not look convinced.

JULIET
(Conspiratorial) I've got scars . . . they're on my lungs.

Pauline looks surprised.

JULIET
I was in bed for months during the war, ravaged by respiratory illness.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

PAULINE
Osteomyelitus turns your bones to chalk. It took them two years to drain all the muck out.

Pauline looks despondently at her leg.

JULIET
Cheer up! All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases! It's all frightfully romantic!

CUT TO:

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAYPauline is furiously pedalling her bicycle along a country road.

EXT. ILAM/DRIVEWAY - DAYLOW ANGLE . . . a tree-lined driveway.

Pauline rides her bicycle up the drive. She pauses, wide-eyed.

PAN TO . . . ILAM - a large stately house, set amongst beautiful gardens . . .

Pauline puts her bike on its stand. She pulls the Mario Lanza album out of her bicycle bag.

Pauline is about to approach the house when she glances across the garden, and is transfixed by an enchanting sight:

Juliet on a sunlit bridge that spans the Ilam stream. She is wearing a shredded chiffon dress, with a Christmas tinsel crown and a necklace made from tinfoil. Sunlight filters through the trees, lending Juliet a magical quality. She's casting flowers onto the water. Pauline stands transfixed. Juliet sees her and smiles.

JULIET
Hi, Paul!

SUDDENLY! . . . an 8-year-old boy - JONATHON HULME - comes charging out of the bushes and lays into Juliet with a wooden sword. He is dressed in a "prince's" costume.

JULIET
0www!

Jonathon runs away. Juliet gives chase, yelling to Pauline.

JULIET
The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get him, Paul!

Pauline joins in the chase after Jonathon, careening through garden and bushes.

Juliet and Pauline lose sight of Jonathon. They pause in a clearing, catching their breath.

JULIET
The blighter's gone to ground!

JONATHON Yaaaa!

Jonathon drops from a tree, onto Pauline, sending, her sprawling. He whacks her on the bottom with his wooden sword.

JULIET
God! Jonty! Jonty-stop it! Go away! We're not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!

Jonathon pokes his tongue at Juliet, turns and runs away.

Juliet offers her hand and pulls Pauline up. She pauses, a look of shock on her face . . .

The Mario Lanza record lies broken on the ground. Pauline looks distraught.

JULIET
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!

PAULINE
(Upset) It doesn't matter.

JULIET
Of course it matters! It's Mario!

I NT. ILAM/LOUNGE - DAYCLOSE ON . . . HENRY HULME - a 44-year-old bespectacled academic. He is sniffing, with a disdainful look on his face. He pulls a packet of mouldy sandwiches his jacket pocket.

HENRY What on earth are these?

HILDA HULME, elegant, 36 years old, is setting down a tray of tea on a small table.

HILDA They're egg and salmon sandwiches . . . I gave them to you several days ago.

HENRY I thought I could smell sulphur.

HILDA God, Henry! You're hopeless! You can't be trusted with something as simple as lunch.

JULIET
(O.S.) Mother!

Hilda looks up as Juliet bursts into the room from the garden, followed by Pauline. Hilda smiles at Pauline.

HILDA Hello . . .

JULIET
Jonty broke Paul's record!

HILDA Oh, dear!

JULIET
We must buy her another one!

Juliet drops to the floor, hauling records out of the radiogram cabinet.

Pauline looks around, taking in the sumptuousness of her surroundings: ornate fireplace, paintings, antique furniture.

HILDA Would you like a cup of tea . . . Paul?

PAULINE
No, thank you.

HILDA Well, Juliet's told us all about you. I hear you're fond of opera.

Before Pauline can reply, Juliet fans Mario Lanza albums across the floor.

JULIET
Which one shall we play?

Pauline shrugs awkwardly. Henry looks up from his papers, rather annoyed at this intrusion. Pauline notices a row of beautifully sculpted Plasticine horses adorning the mantelpiece.

Juliet puts a record on the turntable.

HILDA Juliet . . . your father's trying to study.

JULIET
Daddy can study while we're playing records!

HENRY Why don't you go back outside, mmm? I'll be finished soon.

The record drops on the turntable. The arm swings across.

Henry and Hilda glance at each other. Henry silently gathers up his papers and leaves the room.

The needle drops and Mario Lanza's rendition of "The Donkey Serenade" booms into the room.

SWIRLING CAMERA as Juliet takes Pauline's hand and whirls her around, leading her into . . .

Pauline and Juliet are pedalling their bicycles like mad down a narrow, tree-lined lane.

The "Donkey Serenade" continues . . .

They have a near-miss with an angrily tooting car.

Pauline wobbles out of control! . . . She goes flying into a bush.

The Donkey Serenade finishes abruptly in mid-verse.

Pauline is lying on her back.

Pauline's POV . . . looking straight up into treetops and blue sky. Juliet's face looms over, looking concerned.

JULIET
(Worried) Paul? Oh, God! Paul . . . are you all right?

Pauline's eyes are shut. She speaks with great effort.

PAULINE
(Gasping) I think I'm dying . . .

JULIET
(Upset) Don't . . . please! Please, don't!

Dying breath escapes from Pauline's mouth . . . she goes limp.

Juliet shrieks!

JULIET
(Crying) Paul!!!

Juliet collapses over Pauline's body, crying.

Pauline's eyes flick open! She sniffs and pulls a face.

PAULINE
Urrrgh! You've been eating onions.

Before Juliet has time to react, Pauline pushes her off, giggling maniacally. She leaps to her feet and attempts to run. Juliet grabs Pauline's cardigan, pulling her backwards.

JULIET
You toad!

Pauline sheds the cardigan and runs through the bushes, with Juliet in hot pursuit!

RRRRIP! . . . Juliet tugs at Pauline's blouse and the buttons pop off. Pauline is laughing too hard to run anymore. She pulls off her skirt and waves it around her head as she dances around the bushes, singing "The Donkey Serenade."

PAULINE
(Singing) "There's a light in her eye, Though she may try to hide it, She cannot deny, There's a light in her eye."

Now Juliet is cracking up at the sight of Pauline spinning around in her underwear, shoes and socks.

Pauline circles around and around Juliet, singing. Juliet hurriedly starts undressing down to her underwear.

Juliet giggles and starts jumping up and down.

Pauline suddenly breaks into a run and races through the bushes. Juliet follows.

Both girls are screaming and hooting loudly. Pauline and Juliet burst out of the bushes and . . .

PAULINE

without missing a beat, they continue singing . . .

PAULINE

(Singing) "But all that my darling can scream . . ."

. . . then break down into convulsive laughter. They turn and flee back into the bushes.

ON THE SOUNDTRACK . . . Mario Lanza picks up "The Donkey Serenade" at the point that Pauline and Juliet stopped. The song builds to a rousing final chorus as . . .

Pauline and Juliet collapse on the ground, rolling and tumbling in an embrace.

As Mario sings the last exhilarating notes . . .

CAMERA RISES UP VERTICALLY . . . up through the foliage . . . past the branches of a tree which abruptly BLOCK CAMERA.

Pauline holds James Mason's photo.

(Enraptured) I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!

JULIET
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!

Pauline reacts with a degree of shock.

PAULINE
But, we're all going to Heaven!

JULIET
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.

Pauline giggles.

JULIET
It's an absolute Paradise of music, art and enjoyment.

Pauline is entranced. Juliet plucks up some photos.

JULIET
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.

PAULINE
(Giggling) Saint Mario!

Juliet places Mario Lanza's photo in the shrine.

JULIET
To be known as He!

PAULINE
He . . .

Juliet places James Mason's photo in the shrine.

JULIET

That . . .

Pauline places the last photo in the shrine . . . Orson Welles.

PAULINE
It.

Juliet screws her face up and throws the photo into the stream.

JULIET
Absolutely not! Orson Welles! The most hideous man alive!

Juliet dramatically sweeps her hand over the photos in the shrine and bows her head.

JULIET
We give praise to . . . the saints!

Candlelight flickers on Pauline s enraptured face.

The crumpled photo of Orson Welles floats down the stream. With a sudden violent burst of sound, it is sucked into the weir.

 Bayliss wanders in.

STEVE 
 Pikelets! Yum!

STEVE 
 Not till two-thirty . . .

He reaches for a pikelet-Pauline pushes him away from the table.

PAULINE
This is a private function! Go away!

STEVE 
 retreats, hurt and confused. HONORA 
brings in a plate of scones.

The doorbell rings.

HONORA 
Come on! Sausage rolls.

HERBERT 
(O.S.) Come on through.

HONORA 
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.

HERBERT 
Look who I've found!

HONORA

HONORA

smiles at Juliet.

HONORA 
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.

JULIET
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.

HERBERT 
They sound like a queer mob!

PAULINE
Dad!

HONORA 
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!

JULIET
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.

INSERT SCENE

INT. MARRIAGE GUIDANCE - DAYSEVERAL QUICK SHOTS . . . of Hilda chatting to UNHAPPY COUPLES as Juliet's V.O. continues . . .

JULIET
(V.O.) She has deep discussions with unhappy couples and persuades them to have another go at it. In two years, she's only had four divorces. She should really be working for the U.N.!

WALTER PERRY is now sitting across the table from Hilda. He is ruggedly handsome, in his mid-40s

WALTER My wife's blaming me . . . says it's all my fault.

HILDA And how do you feel about that, Mr. Perry?

WALTER Please . . . call me Bill. I don't know what went wrong. My wife feels . . .

HILDA No . . . no . . . let's talk about your feelings . . . Bill.

The air is crackling with subtext.

exchange a glance.

DING DONG! . . . doorbell rings. HONORA 
gets up.

HONORA 
Eat up, Yvonne.

She leaves the room. Juliet raises her eyebrows at Pauline, who looks embarrassed.

PAULINE
(Quietly) It's my middle name.

HERBERT 
smiles at Juliet.

HERBERT 
Yvonne tells us you're good at making models.

JULIET
I adore anything to do with the arts.

HERBERT 
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?

Pauline looks down, cheeks burning.

HERBERT 
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.

JULIET
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT 
shakes his head.

HERBERT 
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.

Muffled voices from the hallway.

PAULINE
He's the manager!

HONORA 
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.

HONORA 
(O.S.) This is the dining room . . .

She smiles at Juliet.

HONORA 
Do excuse us.

She leads John into the hallway.

HONORA 
(O.S.) Breakfast is between seven and nine . . . the bedroom's small, but it's very clean and comfortable.

Pauline scowls.

HERBERT 
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.

JULIET
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.

HERBERT 
(Laughs) Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!

HERBERT 
chuckles. Pauline and Juliet look at each with knowing smiles.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We have decided how sad it is for other people that they cannot appreciate our genius . . .

CUT TO:

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAYTRACKING ALONG . . . past trees - with sunlight streaming through the branches.

Pauline's V.O. continues . . .

PAULINE

The Hulmes' car is driving along a narrow, winding road on the way to Port Levy.

EXT. WHARF - DAYSUPER: "Port Levy, Easter 1953"

Juliet, in her swimming costume, runs to the end of the jetty and teeters nervously on the edge. Pauline fearlessly barrels past her and jumps in.

PAULINE
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!

JULIET
God, yes!

Juliet starts to giggle at a private thought.

JULIET
(Giggling) I bet she gets up the duff on their first night together!

Pauline guffaws with delight. Jonathon is sitting nearby, digging a hole in the sand.

JONATHON What's "up the duff"?

JULIET
Something you wouldn't understand.

Jonathon launches himself at Juliet, and they roll on the sand, grappling.

JONATHON Tell me! I'm almost 10!

JULIET
You're eight and a half and incredibly stupid!

Pauline is laughing happily.

EXT. COTTAGE - DAYHilda sits on a deck chair in front of the cottage, brushing Pauline's hair. Henry is seated at a table, writing a letter.

Juliet is lying on a towel, making notes in an exercise book.

HILDA What a splendid idea!

JULIET
We're calling him Diello.

HILDA That's a good, dramatic name!

JULIET
Paul thought it up.

Pauline beams.

HILDA Aren't you clever! There, all done.

Pauline stands. Juliet touches Pauline's hair. Hilda laughs.

Henry is rifling through his briefcase.

HENRY Hilda! I can't find that letter from the High Commission. They want our passport numbers.

JULIET
(Surprised) Are you going abroad, Daddy?

Hilda scowls at Henry.

HILDA Your father's attending a university conference in England, darling.

HENRY We'll only be away for a few weeks.

Juliet looks at Hilda, a trace of panic across her face.

JULIET
(Worried) You're not going, are you, Mummy?

Hilda hesitates.

HILDA Well . . . I thought I might. It's a long time for your father and I to be apart.

JULIET
But I should go, too!

HILDA Darling, you've got school. You've only just settled in.

JULIET
But- Hilda suddenly stands.

HILDA Who's coming to the shops? I need some cigarettes.

Jonathon barrels out of the cottage.

JONATHON Me! I'm coming.

HILDA (O.S.) Put on your shoes, Jonathon!

CAMERA MOVES IN . . . to Juliet's distraught face.

EXT. PORT LEVY HILLSIDE - EARLY EVENINGClouds swirling about the sky.

A grassy hillside overlooking Port Levy bay. An island sits in the bay, bathed in the last rays of sunlight.

Juliet is a tiny figure against the vast landscape. She runs blindly toward the edge of the hill.

Pauline appears over the brow . . . the hillside is empty! She panics, running, calling out.

PAULINE
(Worried) Julie! Julie!

Pauline finds Juliet curled up in a little ball. She is motionless. Pauline gently takes Juliet in her arms. Juliet is breathing heavily . . . she squeezes her eyes shut, concentrating hard-a look of desperation on her face.

JULIET
Look, Paul!

Pauline looks about, but can see nothing but a scrubby hillside. She looks mystified.

PAULINE
What?

JULIET
It's so beautiful!

PAULINE
What???

Golden light streams on Pauline and Juliet. Pauline look up as the clouds above them open. Juliet stands as if in trance. She offers her hand to Pauline.

JULIET
Come with me.

Juliet pulls Pauline up and hugs her as they walk forward. The barren landscape around Pauline and Juliet morphs into a beautiful garden . . . the Fourth World!

EXT. FOURTH WORLD - DAYPauline and Juliet are amazed! . . . They stand, holding each other's hand tightly. The world around them take on a new form.

The grass beneath their feet has become a well-kept lawn. They are surrounded by fountains and waterfalls. Unicorns graze on the hillside . . . gigantic butterflies hover in the air.

Pauline and Juliet walk about in wonderment.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Today Juliet and I discovered the key to the Fourth World. We have had it in our possession for about six months, but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ. We saw a gateway through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss. We then realised we had the key . . .

CUT TO:

INT. HULMES' CAR/COUNTRYSIDE - DAYAs Pauline's V.O. continues . . . CAMERA TRACKS IN SLOWLY, past Henry and Hilda, to a SHOT of Pauline and Juliet sitting quietly, staring ahead, blissfully.

PAULINE

PULL OUT . . . to reveal Juliet lying on her bed, in childbirth pose. Her pregnant stomach is pushing at the seams of her school dress.

Juliet wails . . . Pauline pulls out a pillow from between Juliet's legs, her face a mixture of surprise and elation.

PAULINE
It's a boy! Deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!

Pauline hands Juliet the pillow. She cradles it in her arms.

JULIET
I shall call him Diello.

ns s glare deters them.

Pauline sits at the back, smirking.

MRS. STEVE 
NS (Icy) Thank you, Juliet!

JULIET
. . . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . .

MRS. STEVE 
NS That's enough, Juliet!

Juliet stops and stands quietly. Mrs. STEVE 
ns rips the essay out of her hand and waves it under her nose.

MRS. STEVE 
NS I suppose this is your idea of a joke?

JULIET
No, Mrs. STEVE 
ns.

MRS. STEVE 
NS I suppose you think it's witty and clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with this . . . rubbish!

Pauline leaps to her feet.

PAULINE
It's not rubbish!

MRS. STEVE 
NS Sit down, Pauline!

JULIET
I really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE 
n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested.

Pauline points at the blackboard.

PAULINE
It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors!

MRS. STEVE 
NS (Yelling) Sit down!

Pauline sits down, looking victorious.

MRS. STEVE 
NS (To Juliet) A girl like you should be setting an example! To your seat!

Juliet starts coughing. Mrs. STEVE 
ns's face darkens.

MRS. STEVE 
NS Stop it, Juliet!

Juliet continues coughing. She sits heavily. Pauline snorts, trying not to laugh.

Juliet slumps over her desk, coughing . . . globules of blood splatter her exercise book.

Pauline's smile vanishes.

PAULINE
I'm not hungry.

HONORA 
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.

PAULINE
I just want to be on my own for a while.

HONORA 
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.

HONORA 
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!

HONORA 
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.

PAULINE
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?

HONORA 
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.

Juliet tearfully shakes her head. Henry is standing at the foot of the bed, hands behind his back.

HENRY I'm sure you'll like it here . . . it's very tranquil.

HILDA I've spoken to the Matron, and she promises to take special care of you.

HENRY And you can carry on with your studies while you convalesce.

Pauline remains silent.

HONORA 
You used to love making things with Dad, Yvonne.

MOVE IN . . . on Pauline, who has not been listening.

As we listen to Juliet's V.O., we see SCENES of TB hospital life . . . the meals brought around . . . the dayroom . . . the DOCTORS.

JULIET
(Letter V.O.) My dear Charles, I miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as I languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . .

Juliet peers up at a DOG-COLLARED VICAR. She eyes him coldly.

REVEREND NORRIS How are you getting along? It must be awfully hard being away from your school chums . . . I've got something here you might just like to have a look at.

He hands Juliet a leaflet featuring a thin, withered figure in a great deal of pain. "JESUS LOVES YOU" is printed across the top.

Juliet's face hardens.

REVEREND NORRIS Unfortunately, modern medicine can only go so far in combatting an illness like TB. And that's why I'm here . . . because with the power of God, miracles can happen. The Lord has said that those who have faith will be saved! Reach out, Juliet! Reach out for Jesus!

JULIET
(Sarcastically) I'm saving them for a rainy day.

HONORA 
gives her a sympathetic look.

HONORA 
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.

JULIET
(Bitterly) They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."

HONORA 
looks startled at the outburst.

JULIET
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.

JOHN This is quite something . . . you're damn clever.

Pauline beams.

JOHN So . . . Deborah is married to Charles, and this chap Nicholas . . . is her tennis instructor?

PAULINE
Yes, but there's nothing between them. Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy.

She gestures to a Plasticine GINA figure that is sitting or the shelf.

JOHN Looks like you, Yvonne.

Pauline beams.

PAULINE
Juliet made it!

John smiles.

JOHN This is really quite incredible. l bet you girls know the entire royal lineage for the last five centuries.

PAULINE
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.

John stands shivering, flicking through the annual.

JOHN These knitting patterns look damn complicated. Have you tried the tea cosy?

Pauline shakes her head and looks on as John continues to thumb awkwardly through the book, his shivers increasing.

He glances at Pauline nervously.

JOHN It's damn cold, isn't it? Do you think I could hop into bed for a moment . . . just to warm up? My feet are like iceblocks.

And then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . . (Squawky voice) "And Charles the Second met Nell Gwynn aboard a boat and he was a prince and she was a pretty young thing and these thing do happen . . ." (Normal voice) God! It's no wonder I don't excel in history!

JOHN Do you love me as much as I love you?

PAULINE
0f course, my darling Nicholas.

John can't contain himself . . . he starts pressing himself against her body.

JOHN (Panting) My . . . my name's John.

Pauline lies on her back, not responding to his caresses.

PAULINE
I like Nicholas much better!

John climbs on top of Pauline.

JOHN You can call me anything you like . . .

John fumbles around beneath the sheets.

PAULINE
What are you doing?

JOHN Nothing . . .

SUDDENLY!

The outside light flicks on. Sound of footsteps stomping down the path.

THE DOOR OPENS!

PAULINE
Bloody hell!

John desperately tries to conceal himself beneath the bedcovers as . . .

The light flicks on . . . HERBERT 
stands in the doorway. He surveys the situation with a grim expression.

John rolls out of bed and staggers toward the door fumbling with his pyjama cord.

HERBERT 
Go to the house.

John scuttles out of the sleepout. Pauline lies still in bed, peering at her father.

HERBERT 
(Upset) You have broken my heart, Yvonne.

HERBERT 
turns and leaves the room. Pauline stares at the ceiling.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I lay there mesmerised. It was just too frightful to believe . . .

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/DINING ROOM - MORNING BREAKFAST . . .A plate of Weetbix bangs down on the table in front of Pauline. Milk sloshes over the side of the bowl. HONORA 
looks thunderous and stomps off.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) When I got up I found Father had told Mother . . .

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal STEVE 
, Ross, a new boarder, LAURIE, and HERBERT 
seated around the table. The boarders are clearly oblivious to the tense family vibes.

LAURIE Coming to Lancaster Park on Saturday, Mr. Rieper?

HERBERT 
shakes his head, sullenly.

Wendy hurries into the room, grabs a piece of toast, pulling on a coat.

WENDY Where's John? He said he'd walk with me.

HONORA 
stands in the doorway.

HONORA 
John's no longer staying here.

Wendy looks surprised.

LAURIE Shot through, this morning . . . said his old Mum had taken sick.

INT. RIEPFRS' HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNINGPauline is washing dishes, up to her elbows in soapy water. Behind her HONORA 
tidies up, glowering at her daughter.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.

HONORA 
(Angry) From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.

Pauline bangs a dish into the rack.

HONORA 
(Angry) If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?

HONORA 
sighs.

PAULINE
Can I go now?

HONORA 
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.

HONORA 
You think you're such a clever little madam! You had your father in tears last night!

Pauline flinches.

HONORA 
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!

PAULINE
Well, I guess I take after you then!

HONORA 
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.

PAULINE
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!

HONORA 
steps back.

HONORA 
(Softly) You're going to be late.

Pauline triumphantly walks past her mother. HONORA 
barely reacts as Pauline hurries out.

CUT TO: EXT. RIEPERS' HOUSE - NIGHTMidnight at 31 Gloucester St. All lights are off.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I am terribly cut up. I miss Nicholas terrifically. Mother thinks I will have nothing more to do with him, but little she knows . . .

The front door quietly opens and Pauline sneaks out.

Pauline pedals her bicycle furiously along dark streets.

EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHTPauline climbs up a fire escape.

John comes out onto the balcony and hugs her.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Nicholas was pleased that I was so early.

John and Pauline disappear into his room . . .

WIDE SHOT of the house, as Pauline's V.O. continues . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We sat around and talked for an hour and then went to bed. I declined the invitation at first, but he became very masterful and I had no option. I discovered that I had not lost my virginity on Thursday night. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that I have now . . .

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING HOUSE/JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPauline is lying on the bed, with John thrusting away on top of her. John grunts and groans . . . Pauline remains unmoved and uninvolved.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BOROVNIA - DAYThe noonday sun glows in the sky.

Pauline opens her eyes . . . she is lying in a field of the most amazingly colourful flowers.

She stands and looks around her with amazement. She smiles happily.

On one side are fantasy cottages with crooked chimneys and thatched roofs . . . on the other tower the walls of Borovnia Castle.

Music comes wafting out of the castle gates . . . Mario Lanza singing "Funiculi, Funicula."

Pauline walks through the gates, beneath the portcullis, and into...

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY. . . the courtyard. A féte is in progress. The courtyard is full of PLASTICINE PEOPLE, laughing and singing amidst stalls and sideshows.

Pauline pushes her way through the crowd. A Plasticine finger taps her shoulder . . . she spins around and gasps!

PAULINE
Charles!

The PLASTICINE KING smiles.

CHARLES (James Mason voice) Hello, Gina . . . great to see you here!

He turns away. Pauline scans the crowd. She gets a fleeting glimpse of the back of a ROBED WOMAN.

PAULINE
(Calling) Deborah!

Deborah does not hear, and Pauline desperately pushes between Plasticine people to try and reach her.

A blur of Plasticine faces slide past . . .

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING HOUSE/JOHN'S BEDROOM

CLOSE-U P . . . John's sweaty face, still grunting furiously.

CRASH CUT TO:

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD - DAYPauline finds herself pulled into the arms of a fierce-looking PLASTICINE KNIGHT.

PAULINE
(Breathless) Diello!

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Careful, Gina. . . we almost lost you!

Diello suddenly steps back, draws his sword and expertly runs a passing PEASANT through.

He sweeps his hat off and bows at Pauline.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) For you, my lady!

Pauline beams. Her eye is again caught by Deborah's Plasticine figure across the crowd . . . her back is still turned.

PAULINE
Deborah!

Deborah slowly turns around . . . she has a human face-Juliet!

Tears of joy trickle down Pauline's cheeks.

Juliet is laughing and smiling, looking beautiful.

Diello gently wipes Pauline's tears.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) You're crying, Gina . . . don't be sad.

Another Plasticine arm tugs at Pauline's shoulder . . . she turns and looks straight at the figure of . . .

NICHOLAS!

NICHOLAS (John s voice) Yvonne!

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING HOUSE/JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHTCLOSE-UP . . . John's face looming over Pauline.

JOHN Yvonne!

Pauline is lying on the bed beneath him. She looks at him with glazed eyes.

She pushes John away and sits up in bed.

JOHN (Worried) I didn't hurt you, did I?

Pauline jumps out of bed and starts to dress.

PAULINE
I've got to go home.

John jumps out of bed and wraps his arms around her.

JOHN I love you so much.

MOVE IN . . . on Pauline's emotionless face.

CUT TO:

INT. SANATORIUM/CORRIDOR - DAYPauline is hurrying down the sanatorium corridor . . . she breaks into a run.

INT. SANATORIUM/JULIET'S ROOM - DAYJuliet is sitting by her bed, fully clothed. Her suitcases are packed and lie on the bed.

Pauline runs into the room. Juliet stands and they embrace hugging each other tightly.

Henry enters the room and frowns at the sight of the girls hugging. Juliet reaches out for Henry and pulls him into the embrace. He looks decidedly ill at ease as Pauline's black hair nuzzles against his neck.

EXT. STREETS - DAYTRACKING BACK . . . as the Hulmes' car drives toward CAMERA.

Pauline's V.O. starts, reading her poem "The Ones That I Worship":

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) There are living among two dutiful daughters.

INT. HULMES' CAR - DAYPauline and Juliet are sitting together in the back seat.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Of a man who possesses two beautiful daughters,

Henry adjusts the rearview mirror and catches sight of their clasped hands.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) You cannot know nor yet try to guess,/The sweet soothingness of their caress,

Henry's steely gaze in the rearview mirror.

The poem continues over a visual montage:

EXT. ILAM DRIVEWAY - DAYThe Hulmes' car pulls up outside Ilam.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) The outstanding genius of this pair is understood by few,/They are so rare. . .

Hilda emerges out of the house. Juliet gives her a big hug.

JULIET
Mummy!

HILDA Darling! Welcome home!

EXT. STREET - DAYPauline and Juliet sitting in a tram as it crawls along slowly.

John is running alongside, waving and calling, trying to get Pauline's attention. He is clearly pleading with her, but to no avail.

JOHN Yvonne! Stop! I still love you!

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Compared with these two, every man is a fool,/The world is most honoured that they should deign to rule,/And I worship the power of these lovely two,/ With that adoring love known to so few . . .

Pauline looks knowingly at Juliet, then down to John, hurrying along the street.

MATCH CUT TO:

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE GATES - DAYThe Plasticine figure of Nicholas, hurrying down the passage toward the castle gates.

In an alcove beside the gate, the Plasticine figure of Diello is lurking in the shadows, dagger in hand. Beside him is the rope winch that operates the portcullis.

Footsteps approach . . .

Diello presses himself back into the corner . . .

Nicholas walks briskly. As he nears the portcullis, he espies something twinkling on the ground.

LOW ANGLE . . . Nicholas stops, looks down. Directly above him are the jagged teeth of the portcullis.

He reaches down . . . for a silver ring, set with a small pink stone. It is lying on the ground, as if dropped by somebody.

SUDDENLY!

Diello slashes the rope with his dagger. Before Nicholas can react, the portcullis crashes down on him. His Plasticine body is crushed.

Nicholas's twitching fingers release the brooch. It falls to the ground and breaks. The pink stone pops out of its setting, rolls down the path and comes to rest by Pauline's and Juliet's feet.

Juliet picks up the pink stone. She holds it up and it twinkles in the sunlight.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) 'Tis indeed a miracle, one must feel, That two such heavenly creatures are real,

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ILAM/BATH ROOM - N IGHTCLOSE-UP . . . Pauline's face, staring intently ahead.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Hatred burning bright in the brown eyes with enemies for fuel,

CLOSE-UP . . . Juliet's face, staring intently ahead.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes, contemptuous and cruel, Why are men such fools they will not realise,

PULL OUT . . . to show Pauline and Juliet lying in opposite ends of a hot, steaming bath, staring at each other.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) The wisdom that is hidden behind those strange eyes.

INT. ILAM/)ULIET'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPOEM CONTINUES AS . . .

Pauline and Juliet . . . sleeping in each other's arms in bed.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) And these wonderful people are you and I.

FAST TRACK IN . . . to the bedroom door.

Henry is silently observing the two sleeping girls, his face stoney.

Sound of a distant thunderclap . . .

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS'HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTHenry is standing on the Riepers' doorstep. Lightning flashes light up his face like something out of a gothic horror.

HENRY Mrs. Rieper . . . may I come in?

HONORA 
is standing, holding the door open, looking rather surprised at the unexpected visitor.

HONORA 
(Surprised) Yes, of course.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - NIGHTHenry and HONORA 
are sitting in the lounge. Henry looking rather uncomfortable on the edge of a shabby armchair. HERBERT 
is at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the top off a bottle.

HENRY Your daughter's . . . an imaginative and a spirited girl- HONORA 
If she's spending too much time at your house, you only need to say. All those nights she spends over-she's assured us that you don't mind . . .

HENRY It's rather more complicated than that. Since Mrs. Hulme and I have returned home, Juliet has been behaving in a rather disturbed manner . . . surliness, short temper . . . general irritability-most uncharacteristic.

HERBERT 
is pouring a drink.

HERBERT 
Sure I can't tempt you to a nice sherry, Dr. Hulme?

HENRY No, thank you. The thing is . . .

HONORA 
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.

HERBERT 
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.

HENRY My wife and I feel the friendship is . . . unhealthy.

HERBERT 
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!

HONORA 
frowns at Henry.

HONORA 
(Concerned) I'm not sure what you mean, Dr. Hulme.

Henry pauses for a moment.

HENRY Your daughter appears to have formed a rather . . . unwholesome attachment to Juliet.

HONORA 
(Worried) What's she done???

HENRY She hasn't done anything . . . it's the intensity of the friendship that concerns me. I think we should avert trouble before it starts.

Henry hands a business card to Honora.

HENRY Dr. Bennett is a very good friend. He's a general physician, but has some expertise in child psychology. If Pauline is indeed developing in a rather . . . er . . . wayward fashion, Dr. Bennett is the ideal man to set her back on track.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY - DAYPauline is slouched in a chair, looking very sullen.

DR. BENNETT (O.S.) What about your studies . . . are you enjoying school?

DR. BENNETT is seated behind his desk. Pauline is silent. She looks at the ceiling. HONORA 
is sitting next to Pauline.

DR. BENNETT Are you happy at home? Pauline is silent.

HONORA 
Answer Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.

Pauline remains silent.

HONORA 
(Annoyed) Yvonne!

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . . perhaps you wouldn't mind waiting outside.

HONORA 
leaves the room.

DR. BENNETT Do you like your mother?

Pauline hesitates for a moment.

PAULINE
No.

DR. BENNETT And why is that?

PAULINE
She nags me.

DR. BENNETT And that's why you like to stay with the Hulmes?

Pauline looks wary. She doesn't answer.

DR. BENNETT Or is it because you want to be with Juliet?

No answer.

DR. BENNETT Do you . . . like girls?

PAULINE
No.

DR. BENNETT Why not?

PAULINE
They're silly.

DR. BENNETT But Juliet's not silly?

PAULINE
(Emphatic) No!

DR. BENNETT Yvonne . . . there's nothing wrong with having a close friend, but sometimes things can get . . . too friendly. Such associations can lead to trouble. It isn't good to have just one friend . . . my wife and I have several friend and we enjoy seeing them on a regular basis, and it's all perfectly healthy. Perhaps you could think about spending time with . . . boys- Dr. Bennett stops in mid-sentence, a look of surprise face. He looks down at his chest . . .

A red bloodstain is slowly spreading across his shirt. Dr. Bennett twitches slightly as the blade of a sword work its way out of his chest!

Pauline's face lights up as . . .

Diello rises up behind Dr. Bennett.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Bloody fool!

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. DR. BENNETT'S WAITING ROOM - DAYThe surgery door opens and Pauline steps out, looking elated.

HONORA 
looks up from her chair.

Dr. Bennett appears in the doorway behind Pauline. He casts a wary glance in her direction.

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . .

HONORA 
bustles in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door. Pauline sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF SICK PATIENTS.

INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY - DAYCLOSE-UP . . . Dr. Bennett's mouth.

DR. BENNETT Homosexuality . . .

HONORA 
looks horrified.

DR. BENNETT I agree, Mrs. Rieper, it's not a pleasant word. But let us not panic unduly. This condition is often a passing phase with girls of Yvonne's age.

HONORA 
But she's always been such a normal, happy child.

DR. BENNETT It can strike at any time, and adolescent are particularly vulnerable.

HONORA 
But what about the vomiting? She's lost a lot of weight . . .

Dr. Bennett shrugs.

DR. BENNETT Physically, I can find nothing wrong. I've checked for TB and she's clear. I can only attribute her weight loss to her mental disorder.

HONORA 
(Shocked) Oh . . .

DR. BENNETT Look, Mrs. Rieper . . . try not to worry too much. Yvonne's young and strong, and she's got a loving family behind her. Chances are she'll grow out of it. If not . . . well, medical science is progressing in leaps and bounds. There could be a breakthrough at any time!

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTSLOW TRACKING . . . down the hallway corridor. As the CAMERA passes doorways, we see the Riepers' family routine . . . HONORA 
in the kitchen. HERBERT 
wanders by and goes through the adjoining door into the lounge. He sits down and opens the paper. Wendy is attempting to t the fire. The family are chatting to each other, but we do not hear their conversation because . . .

. . . we are listening to Pauline's V.O.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . . .

CAMERA CRANES UP . . . through the ceiling and into . . .

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. . . Pauline's bedroom. The room is filled with the sad strains of "E Lucevan le Stelle," an aria from Puccini's Tosca that is booming out from Pauline's portable record player.

CAMERA CRANES UP past the foot of the bed to reveal Pauline lying on her back, looking very morose.

TRACK IN TO her intense face as her V.O. continues . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) l wish I could die. This is not an idle or temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought of death is not fearsome.

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - CHRISTMAS DAY 1953CLOSE-UP . . . a Christmas present is torn open . . . followed by several more, in quick cuts. Typical 1953 presents.

Honora, Herbert, Wendy and Pauline are sitting on the floor, amidst presents and discarded wrapping paper. Grandma Parker is sitting in a chair.

HERBERT 
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA 
looks at her with concern.

HONORA 
(Concerned) Is it hurting, dear?

Pauline looks blank.

HONORA 
Your leg . . . have you got pain?

Pauline shakes her head. She rips open a present . . . a new diary.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTCLOSE-UP of the Jan. 1st page. Pauline's pen starts to write . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto: "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be dead."

Pauline looks up from her diary as the CAMERA RUSHES IN toward her face.

I NT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MORNING

HONORA 
walks in, waving a letter.

HONORA 
This arrived today, Yvonne . . .

Pauline looks at her mother with distaste.

PAULINE
My name is Gina!

HONORA 
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.

PAULINE
What does old Stew want?

HONORA 
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.

PAULINE
Who cares!

HONORA 
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.

PAULINE
I'm educating myself!

HONORA 
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE
I'm doing my own writing!

HONORA 
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.

HONORA 
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

PAULINE
(Scornful) What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!

HONORA 
is very angry.

HONORA 
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.

PAULINE
(Shouting) I don't wanna be in bloody school!

HONORA 
(Shouting) All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!

HONORA 
storms out of the room and slams the door.

JULIET
You mean travel by ourselves?

Pauline nods.

JULIET

Sound of a camera clicking.

PAULINE

JULIET

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/CORRIDOR - NIGHTHONORA 
knocks harder.

PAULINE
(O.S.) (Facetious) Yes, yes, yes!

HONORA 
(Angry) You open up this door right now!

Sound of Pauline getting out of the bathwater.

PAULINE
(O.S.) (Angry) I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!

HONORA 
(Angry) Open this door!

The door opens and Pauline strolls out, a towel around her. HONORA 
starts berating her. However, we only hear Pauline's V.O. as HONORA 
follows her down the corridor.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Mother gave me a fearful along the usual strain.

Pauline pauses by her bedroom door as HONORA 
continues talking to her.

CLOSE UP . . . HONORA

WALTER Would you like one, Juliet?

JULIET
Don't try and fob me off! It's going to cost you a hundred pounds, or I'm blabbing to Daddy!

Hilda looks at Walter, appalled. She looks Juliet square in the eye.

HILDA Mr. Perry and I are in love, Juliet.

Juliet s eyes widen at this unexpected confession.

WALTER Hilda!

HILDA Your father knows about us. Until other arrangements can be made, we've decided to live as a threesome.

Juliet looks confused. Tears spring to her eyes.

JULIET
(Angry) I don't care what you do! Pauline and I are going to Hollywood. They're desperately keen to sign us up. We're going to be film stars!

HILDA What are you talking about?

JULIET
(Yelling) It's all arranged . . . we don't need your bloody hundred pounds anyway, so stick it up your bottom!

Juliet turns and leaves, slamming the door.

Hilda puts her head in her hands.

HENRY Your mother and I are getting divorced.

Juliet is in shock. She clutches Pauline's hand.

MOVE IN . . . to CLOSE-UP of Pauline.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) The shock is too great to have penetrated my mind. It is so incredible. Poor Father. Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind and understanding . . .

Pauline's V.O. continues over . . .

A conversation between Henry and the two girls. The large lounge at Ilam is dark and cold. The mood is bleak.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) He said we must tell him everything about our going to America. He was both hope-giving and depressing. We talked for a long time and Deborah and I were near tears by the time it was over.

INT. ILAM/HALLWAY - MORN I NGPauline's V.O. continues over . . .

Henry ushers Pauline and Juliet out of the lounge. He walks Pauline toward the front door.

EXT. ILAM/DRIVEWAY - MORNING

Pauline's V.O. continues over . . .

Pauline rides her bicycle down the drive in the rain.

Dr. Hulme is standing at the door, watching her go . . . a stoney expression on his face.

INT. ILAM/JULIET'S BEDROOM - NIGHTJuliet is propped up in bed, looking sick and pale. Hilda is sitting by the side of the bed. Henry stands at the foot of the bed, hands behind his back.

HENRY Your mother and I have talked things over and we've made some decisions . . . I am resigning from the university and will be taking up a position back in England.

Juliet looks horrified.

JULIET
(Vehemently) But Daddy, you can't just leave me with Mother!

Hilda looks hurt.

HILDA We thought it best that you accompany your father. . .

JULIET
(Worried) Is Gina coming, too?

HENRY (Annoyed) Of course not!

JULIET
(Angry) I'm not going to England without Gina!

Hilda and Henry exchange an awkward glance.

HILDA You're not going to England, darling.

Juliet looks confused.

HENRY I'm leaving you in South Africa with Auntie Ina.

Juliet starts to tremble.

HILDA That chest of yours isn't getting any better. The warmer climate is just what you need . . .

HENRY For the good of your health.

Juliet opens her mouth and screams.

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPauline is crouched on her bed, hugging her knees. She stares intensely ahead.

PAULINE
(Intense) The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!

HONORA 
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.

PAULINE
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!

HONORA 
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!

PAULINE
(Intense) You have to let me go!

HONORA

HONORA 
We'll talk about this when you've calmed down.

HONORA 
pauses at the door. Pauline is slowly rocking on the bed, staring at the wall.

CLOSE-UP . . . Pauline's face as we hear her diary V.O.:

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.

HONORA 
Love, you can still write to each other.

HONORA 
softly touches Pauline's cheek. Pauline winces, averting her face.

MOVE IN . . . to EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Pauline's eyes.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die . . .

CUT TO:

INT. UNIVERSITY HALL - DAYCLOSE-UP . . . a cloth is whipped away revealing a portrait of Henry painted by Rudi Gopez.

Henry is on stage for the unveiling. He shakes hands with PROFESSOR 2. Hilda is sitting amongst various dignitaries on the stage.

PROFESSOR 1 is at the podium.

PROFESSOR 1 I can not begin to attempt to measure the inestimable value of Dr. Hulme's contributions to Canterbury College, both social and official. We wish both him and Mrs. Hulme all the best for the future.

On sound of large audience clapping:

CUT between Pauline and Juliet . . .

JULIET
But that's not true! I've got one.

PAULINE
(Choked up) I need my sodding parents' consent.

Tears well in Juliet's eyes.

JULIET
(Sobbing) Don't cry, Gina . . . We're not going to be separated. They can't make us . . . they can't!

Hilda quietly looms up behind Juliet. She gently takes the phone out of Juliet's hand and puts it back on the receiver. Juliet struggles in Hilda's arms, pushing her mother away, screaming.

Pauline stands holding the dead phone.

HONORA 
Yvonne.

Pauline turns and faces her mother.

HONORA 
Please don't be like this, love.

Pauline gives HONORA 
a cursory glance and walks past her, up the stairs. HONORA 
looks after her, a hurt expression on her face.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I did not tell Deborah of my plans for removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal. I am trying to think of some way.

CUT TO:

EXT. RIEPERS' BACK GARDEN - DAYTHWACK! . . . An ax chops into a log, splitting it in two.

HONORA 
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - DAYHONORA 
and HERBERT 
are sitting with Hilda in the lounge.

HILDA She's uncontrollable. I've told her that Pauline is not going to South Africa, but she refuses to accept it.

HERBERT 
and HONORA 
exchange a glance.

HILDA I expect you've heard the same from your own daughter.

HONORA 
shakes her head.

HONORA 
(Upset) Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for nearly two weeks.

HILDA Yes . . . well, it hasn't been an easy time for any of us, Mrs. Rieper.

HERBERT 
She's cut us out of her life . . . it's been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.

HILDA What I'm suggesting is that we let the girls spend these last three weeks together. We'd like Pauline to come and stay with Juliet, until she leaves.

HERBERT 
Is that a good idea?

HERBERT 
looks at HONORA 
. . . tears are running down her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the door.

HERBERT 
Why don't I telephone you tonight, Mrs. Hulme?

HILDA Yes, of course.

HERBERT 
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.

HONORA 
breaks down into heavy sobs.

Pauline's drab clothes transform into a ballgown as she passes through the doorway.

The song soars as they waltz into the middle of the ballroom . . . Pauline spins . . . in a blur she sees decorations and faces all around.

Pauline gasps as Diello takes her by the waist and waltzes around the room. Characters from Borovnia fill the room. Juliet dances with Charles.

A man in a dark suit turns around . . . MARIO! He launches into the second verse!

Pauline laughs happily as she is swept around and around.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!

They are no longer in the lounge - at some point the waltz has dissolved into . . .

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT. . . the courtyard in Borovnia Castle.

The crowds continue dancing to "The Loveliest Night of the Year."

A doorway in the courtyard . . . Henry Hulme is lurking in the shadows, peering out. He is dressed like a jester with cap and bells. The CAMERA PUSHES IN . . . to a distorted FISHEYE SHOT of Henry.

Pauline's V.O. continues, building in intensity . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as a March hare!

At the conclusion of the song . . . TWO BURLY BOROVNIAN EXECUTIONERS swing their axes down, chopping a couple of ropes. A huge banner unfurls down the side of the castle tower. In embroidered letters three stories tall is the word . . .

Pauline and Juliet are sitting in the cinema, absorbed in the film.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) It is appalling. He is dreadful. I have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness . . . but I adore him!

CUT TO:

EXT. CHRISTCHURCH STREETS - NIGHTPauline and Juliet run along dark, damp, atmospheric streets.

Orson Welles steps out of the shadowy alley into the light. He leers at them. The girls scream! They turn to run, but Orson looms out of another alley.

Pauline and Juliet squeal and run about. PASSERSBY observe their antics with some alarm.

INT. ILAM/HALLWAY - NIGHTThe front door bursts open. Pauline and Juliet run in, still in a state of high excitement.

They charge up the stairs.

INT. ILAM/JULIET'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPauline and Juliet tumble into the bedroom, only to find Orson lurking behind the door! They scream and flee along the balcony only to be greeted by Orson at the other end! They run back into the bedroom and collapse onto the bed, screaming and giggling.

PUSH IN . . . to Pauline's exalted face.

PAULINE

INTERCUT WITH SHOTS of Pauline and Juliet intertwined with Orson and Diello. Pauline and Juliet sometimes change into their Plasticine counterparts, Deborah and Gina.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We spent a hectic night going through the saints. It was wonderful! Heavenly! Beautiful! And ours! We felt satisfied indeed. We have now learned the peace of the thing called Bliss, the joy of the thing called Sin.

INT. ILAM/BATHROOM - NIGHTBATHWATER

Pauline and Juliet are soaking in opposite ends of a steaming bathtub.

A few moments silence. Juliet looks blankly at Pauline. A tear rolls down her cheek.

PAULINE
I'm coming with you.

I know what to do about mother.

Juliet's eyes narrow.

REVERSE ANGLE . . . Pauline and Juliet walk toward the house. Unicorns are grazing in the Ilam garden. Fairies dance in the air. Large dragonflies hover around the girls.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great.

EXT. ILAM GROUNDS - NIGHTCLOSE-UP . . . James Mason's photo lands in a roaring fire and is immediately consumed by the flames. Photos of Mel Ferrer, Michael Rennie and Orson Welles follow.

Pauline and Juliet are standing by a roaring fire in the Ilam grounds. They throw Mario records onto the flames. The black vinyl curls and melts. Their Plasticine figures are next. Globs of melted Plasticine drip amidst the burning debris.

It is clearly a strange, ritualistic burning. Pauline and Juliet watch the fire, enraptured.

JULIET
Only the best people fight against all obstacles . . .

Juliet squeezes Pauline's hand.

JULIET

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE - DAYHONORA 
is bustling about the house, working. Every time she bends down, or leans over, Pauline is revealed behind her. She is helping, but the mood is one of a hunter closing in on its prey.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How odd-yet how pleasing.

PAULINE
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.

JULIET
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?

PAULINE
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .

JULIET
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!

Pauline puts the brick in the stocking and ties a knot in the foot.

PAULINE
. . . but in the end I decided against it. I thought it would spoil all their fun.

Pauline puts the brick in her shoulder bag.

WENDY There's nothing wrong with Sir Edmund Hillary buying underwear for his wife. He was a very nice man!

JULIET
I bet it was thermal underwear!

Pauline roars with laughter.

PAULINE
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!

HONORA 
That's enough, Yvonne!

Juliet roars with laughter. The others don't laugh.

A SERIES OF CARDS explains what happened subsequently:

In the hours following Honora's murder, a police search of the Rieper house unearthed Pauline's dairies. This resulted in her immediate arrest for the murder her mother.

Juliet was arrested and charged with murder the following day.

After Pauline's arrest it was discovered that Honor, HERBERT 
Rieper had never married. Pauline was therefore charged under her mother's maiden name of Parker.

In August 1954, a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury in the Christchurch Supreme Court trial and Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were found guilty of murder.

Too young for the death penalty, they were sent to separate prisons to be 'Detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure.'

Juliet was released in November 1959 and immediately left New Zealand to join her mother overseas.

Pauline was released two weeks later, but remain New Zealand on parole until 1965.

It was a condition of their release that they never again.

Writing and Directing Heavenly Creatures

A Talk with Frances Walsh and Peter Jackson

Peter Jackson and Frances Walsh were both born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand. Jackson's first film, Bad Taste 1988), was made by the director over a period of several years while he was working as a photo apprentice at a local newspaper. Jackson's two following films, Meet the Feebles (1990) and Braindead (1992), were co-written with Walsh and Stephen Sinclair; the latter was a hit on the film festival circuit, winning 16 international prizes including a best picture award from the

Academy of Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror.

Jackson and Walsh (who had previously written for episodic television in New Zealand) co-authored the screenplay for Heavenly Creatures, which went on to garner nominations for both an Academy Award and a Writers Guild Award. Their latest collaboration is The Frighteners, executive-produced

by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox; it will be released in 1996. Jackson and Walsh live in Wellington with their son, Billy.

The version of Heavenly Creatures published here is a final draft, completed in March 1993. The screenplay was 107 pages long.

Fran, my understanding is that you were the first to become interested in the Parker/Hulme murder case as a film subject. It seems to be a popular topic in New Zealand.

Frances Walsh: Well, popular topic-I'm not sure about that. But it's certainly a piece of New Zealand criminal history that has entered into the realm of myth. And as a young girl growing up, I knew about it, and had read lurid newspaper accounts- "Lesbian killers' rampage"?

FW: Yes, yes. And I also got my hands on a novel called Obsession, which I read when I was about 14. I thought at the time that it was extremely good. [laughs] It takes a very damning view of the girls-it's written by two English journalists who came out here to cover the trial. It was something of a hack job that set out to sensationalize the case.

And there was also a play, wasn't there?

FW: Yeah, there's been a play, and there have been nonfiction books written about it. There's also been a great deal of coverage over the years in newspapers and magazines, so it's always had a profile here.

Since it had already been treated in all of these different ways, what compelled you both to explore the subject again?

Peter Jackson: Well, we didn't really think it had been treated that well. Nothing that we had read did we particularly like. And also, the other various treatments all seemed to have a specific agenda, which attempted to make political statements about the murder. What interested us was to show these two 15-year-old girls with no other agenda than to be as accurate as we possibly could, and to somehow imagine what was going on inside their minds.

I know that all of Pauline's voiceovers from the film are from actual diary entries. You made an interesting comment awhile back about how they actually informed the structure of the film. Could you elaborate on that?

PJ: Well, the structure was fairly apparent once we started to do research. It wasn't just the diaries themselves, it was the general research. We read as much of the diaries as we could-we haven't actually ever seen the full, unedited diary-but we gathered as many of the excerpts that were releasedat the time of the trial as we could, which amounted to quite a few pages. And we read the newspapers, and interviewed people, and then the three acts sort of materialized quite neatly. You know, act one is when the two girls meet and become friends, and the turning point is at the end of the first act when you realize that they are now bonded.

FW: It's when they have their first delusional experience together at Port Levy, where they go into the Fourth World. You know these two girls have an imagination that's going to lead to something interesting happening. The second turning point comes with the decision to murder Mother, which tips

the story into the third act.

Whom did you interview to cull together all of this information?

PJ: Well, we went through about 35 or 40 people. We wanted to interview as many people as we could find. Several refused. We talk to about 15 or 16 of their classmates, which was experience. These were 55-year-old women spread out around the country, and they all had changed their names because they'd gotten married. It was quite a detective job to find them.

I read somewhere that the school was not particularly enthusiastic about this; did they help you locate the ex-students?

PJ: No, the school didn't want anything to do with it. Christchurch Girls' School had erased these two girls from their history. The yearbook that had the class photograph with Pauline is no longer available. If you go to the school library, they have all the yearbooks available apart from 1953's, which has her photo in it. It sort of cleansing of the books. The school didn't recognize what it was we were trying to do, which was to redress the issue. Why wipe these girls off the school records? I mean, they were human beings.

FW: Peter and Jim Booth, the producer of the movie, went to see the headmistress of the school, and after they explained what we wanted to do, and allowed her to read the script, her only comment was, "Why can't you make a film about pupils of whom we are proud?"

PJ: We also heard from several sources we interviewed that on the day after the murder happened, the headmistress at the time stood up in front of the assembly and said, "No girl is to discuss a certain matter." This was, like, the day after two of their pupils had murdered somebody, and they couldn't even refer to it directly. Forty years later, we got the sense that the school was exactly the same. And that really gave us all the more reason to make the movie, because we felt that these people were still

living in the 1950s. We found that with a lot of the people we interviewed-that even though 40 years had gone by, they were still presenting attitudes of the '50s: this was some dark, sordid little thingthat was best kept quiet and should never be mentioned. Many times we got, "Why on earth would you want to make a film about this?" We should just forget about it, and hope it will somehow disappear."

And we actually thought about doing that. But within 20 or 30 years most of the people connected with it will be dead, and at that point in time we'll never know anything about it. We felt it was a good time now, while there were still quite a few people alive, to do the interviews and try to get something accurate, for the record. We were also aware of the responsibility we had, because film is such a persuasive medium, and we knew that, unlike any other medium-the newspaper accounts, the play-itcan give an audience visual images, which, in a way, almost replace the real event, especially if you weren't born at that time. So we thought if we made a film now, perhaps people in New Zealand would look upon this case in a different way. That was a responsibility we felt that we didn't want to take lightly.

Pertaining to that quest for accuracy, how does one go about reconstructing, for instance, conversations between Pauline and her mother, or other scenes for which there is no direct documentation?

FW: Well, all you can do is attempt to find out as much as you can about the people involve-the type of people they were, their class background, etc. So to that degree, we spoke to people who knew the Riepers, for example, who had good knowledge of the girls.

Did you interview any of the boarders in the Rieper house?

PJ: Yeah, I did, very briefly. We found one of the boarders, who spoke to me on the telephone. I did the interview, and then the following day I called him back to ask him some more questions and he clammed up; he didn't want to talk to me anymore. He'd obviously gone home to his wife, and she'd

wound him up about the whole thing and told him he shouldn't be involved with it.

FW: I think our understanding when we set out to write this was that we would never be able to re-create the right interiors, with characters who precisely reflect the people who were really there. Our intention was to be true to what we understood of the girls' friendship, and the nature of that

friendship and the nature of those families from which those two girls came. It was never an attempt to re-create reality. We could never do that, obviously. So we went into those things with the spirit of trying to reflect the situation, rather than reality.

PJ: The Hulme family were a lot easier to research than Pauline's family, because the Hulmes were public figures at the time. Henry Hulme being the rector of the local university, there were obviously a lot of university people we could talk to professors, students-who worked with him. Hilda Hulme was also quite a public figure. They were, in some respects, the royalty of Christchurch, because the English class system was and still does exist down there, and they all take these things quite seriously.There used to be garden and tennis parties at Ilam, and there were a lot of people who had social contact with the parents and Juliet at the time.

The research actually carried on through the shooting of the film. I remember when we were in England, auditioning actresses for the part of Juliet before we found Kate Winslet, and we found out that [the late] Anthony Quayle, the English actor, had actually visited the Hulmes in Christchurch in the '50s, so we tracked down his wife and spoke with her. The research just kept on going all the time. We had trips to Christchurch to do our research, but once we started working on the film, we moved there

for nearly five months, so it was an ideal opportunity to find others. We'd hear things about this person who had sat next to Pauline in typing class, and we'd rush around to see them.

I'm sure the production got a certain amount of notice in the local media, so people probably approached you.

PJ: To an extent, but not as much as what we had hoped. Pauline's people were actually quite difficult to research, because they just weren't public; they were quite private people.

FW: We have heard, subsequently, that Pauline's sister, Wendy, has seen the film. She still lives in Christchurch. Her con meets were that the film managed to capture the atmosphere of her home at that time, but her criticism was that the family was "better" than that, we had portrayed them in too shabby a light. And that really touched me.

PJ: She thought that the portrayal of the tension between Pauline and her mother was very accurate. It was nice, because Wendy is one of the few key people alive who refuses to talk about it. She absolutely refuses to have anything to do with journalists, with anyone, so it was actually very sweet of her to get the message back to us. It was quite amazing to us that she had even gone to see this film. She thought it was good, but incredibly difficult to watch.

In gathering all of this material, I'm sure there were certain things that didn't "fit" dramatically. Was there anything you were tempted to use but didn't, because it was either too sensationalistic or too ethically questionable?

PJ: There was one area we deliberately steered clear of that we felt ultimately didn't have a relation to what we were wanting to tell, and that was that in the Rieper household there was actually a younger sister, named Rosemary, who had Down's syndrome, who is still alive; Wendy still looks after her. At the time of the murder, Rosemary was only 8 years old. This made Honora's life all the more difficult: the daughter lived in a special home, and would come home on the weekends. Pauline writes about Rosemary a lot in her diaries; she was very fond of her. But it was one area where we felt that we were being too invasive into the privacy of this family.

As you say, there was quite a bit of stuff we had to leave out for structural reasons. Pauline's diaries are very, very funny. We ended up using a lot of the more dramatic material in the movie, in the scenes in which she's talking about murder and suicide, but unfortunately we had to leave a lot of the funny things out. She records hilarious conversations that she and Juliet had, and it's all very witty.

Sometimes we used diary entries and just dramatized them, as opposed to using a voiceover. Like the sequence where they go into the Fourth World, where the hilltop changes into a magical landscape. That is described in detail in the diary. So it was a case of having to be very selective, and at the end of the day, it was the more dramatic selections that made it through to the movie rather than the funnier stuff.

The girls ' sense of humor does manage to come through in the film, though. I'm thinking, for instance, of the last scene in the Rieper house, when the family is having lunch with Juliet before the two girls and HONORA 
go to Victoria Park. Were their snide comments about Sir Edmund Hillary in the diary, or were they invented by the two of you?

FW: That was out of our imagination. We were told that they were extremely jolly at that last meal-it was actually in the court records-and that they were cracking jokes, and saying silly, outrageous things, on a sort of giggly high. And we knew that Wendy had worked at Farmer's, the localdepartment store, and also what had been very big in the news that year was Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, climbing Mt. Everest. He had been knighted, and became a huge national hero; he still is. Because he'd also spent time in Christchurch, we felt that this was an appropriate thing for

them to send up, because whatever they did, they were terribly irreverent. If the Queen was visiting, for example, they wouldn't bother to go out unless it was to take note of the decorations, the pomp and ceremony, to enrich one of their own royal celebrations. They really had no respect for the icons of the day; their interior world was much more important to them.

The film critic for Time, Richard Corliss, likened you to a "physician who assumes a patients fever in order to understand her illness." At what point did you two decide that this was going to have to be presented from the girls' point of view?

PJ: I think from the beginning. That was one of the motivations for doing it. None of the accounts we came across were from the girls' point of view. Like we'd said before, they all had other agendas, so we felt that telling the girls' story was important. It did take us a long time to be able to do that, because it took us a long time to learn who they were, and what was driving them. We were a bit confused-there was a bit of mystery at the beginning-but the more we read, the more we talked to people, we gradually began to formulate who these people were. Ultimately, there was a lot of Pauline that I could recognize in myself, which was very useful.

You, too, Fran?

FW: I felt that the diary: offered the first insight into the friendship, and into Pauline in particular. It was an extremely interesting account of her life, documenting both dramatic and mundane events with a great deal of literary flair. She was a very imaginative, funny and clever young woman who had some quite pretentious ideas, as teenagers do, and I warmed toward her immediately. Reading the diary made me wonder about the huge discrepancies between this young woman and the monster who was portrayed in the newspaper accounts and everything else. And I thought it would be great to take that journey to find out who she was. Because no diary of Juliet's survived-we have heard from people that she did keep a diary, but it was destroyed-I thought it would be harder to get to know her, but that really wasn't the case, because she appeared to be someone who more readily shared her life with people; she was much more of a social creature than Pauline. So it was a combination of the private world that they shared and the understanding that we got from talking to their school friends, inparticular, that gave us insight into the nature of these two girls and the way they appeared to the rest of the world.

I think it's fair to say that both Peter and I felt hugely sympathetic toward Pauline and Juliet, and we did start to identify and empathize with them, all the while trying to keep in balance the knowledge of this terrible act. It was that dynamic, of really liking them, but feeling abhorrence at what they'd done, that kept the thing alive for so long in our minds, and gave the film inner life.

Peter, your camera work, in all of the films you've directed, is extremely dynamic. In 'Heavenly Creatures,' the almost hyperactive camera seems to have an organic relationship to the girls' euphoric state. I've noticed in this script that a lot of these camera directions are written in, with more detail than most other screenplays I've read. Do all of your scripts read like this?

PJ: In this particular screenplay, camera movement came quite readily during the writing stages. At the end of the day, the script is not the document we want to go out and sell; it's the document that the cast and crew have to read. When we write a script intended for me to direct, it's right from the beginning a shooting script; a document for technicians to use. You know, the grips put a circle around the word "DOLLY" so they remember on that particular day of shooting they're going to have to have it on the truck. With this movie, probably more than any other I've done, the camera moves were integral to the scriptwriting. I'll tell you where that came from: the music. We read very early in our research that Pauline and Juliet were both obsessed with Mario Lanza. Neither of us were familiar with his music, so we went out and got some of his records, and before we started writing we played through them and came across several songs that we really liked. One of the very first ones we heard was "The Donkey

Serenade"- FW: Well, we knew that was important to them because Pauline had named one of her novels "The Donkey Serenade."

PJ: When we heard it, just the life and vitality in the song immediately indicated Steadicam. [laughs] It immediately told you you had to have a moving camera. We chose all the songs that were in the movie, and, in the case of "The Donkey Serenade," wrote scenes around them. I found it a great visual tool. It's never happened before in anything I've done-I mean, I've never had the music in advance. We had these songs playing while we were working to get ourselves psyched up to write a scene. At the same time, the music helped me visualize, so that visualization ended up going down on the page. Of course, once you actually arrive on the set, and you have the actors and the camera people there, things can change. I don't regard anything that's written into a script in terms of a camera direction asbeing locked in stone.

How long did it take the two of you to finish a first draft?

PJ: Not really long. I think the first draft was written in probably 10 or 12 weeks. But we didn't start to write until we'd uncovered several months' worth of research.

And the draft we're publishing is the shooting script?

PJ: Yeah. I think that's about draft number five. We did an interesting thing. We did a certain amount of research first, while we were still working on Braindead [Dead Alive in U.S.], and then we wrote the first

draft from the position where we felt we knew some of the facts, but there were a lot of gaps. We thought if we wrote a draft we would know where the holes were, and we would know what we had to pursue in terms of research. For instance, Fran and I had never been down to Christchurch when we wrote this first draft, and Christchurch is such an integral part of the story. Then we made the trip down there before the second draft and were able to modify a lot of things, interview lot more people. We actually did that on purpose, because we wanted to nail the story before overlaying it with a lot of historical detail.

How do the two of you handle writing collaboratively?

PJ: Well, it depends. You know, if Fran's working on some re-writes while we're shooting, and I'm on the set, she'll show me some work that she's done when I come home and we'll revise it together, but generally, when we're actually writing the initial drafts of the script, it's always together.

I think that we both have a good understanding of structure, which helps, and I'm obviously very visually oriented, and Fran is very good on dialogue and character, so we complement each other quite well. I think the best advantage that we have in writing scripts together is that we write a script that I go and make, which is, I think, a wonderful thing. It would be a strange experience for us to write a script that someone else was going to make, because we've never actually experienced that loss of control that so many other writers have. So right from the very beginning, it's a movie. It's not a piece of writing that's going to go out to the marketplace and may or may not sell.

Just one little thing. Even though Heavenly Creatures was very much written by the two of us, my favorite scene in the movie was written by Fran by herself.

Which one is that?

PJ: Well, it was late one night, and we were hoping to finish the first draft of the script-it was, like, ten o'clock already-and we had arrived at the sequence in the tearooms where they're having their last cup of tea before they walk down the track. We sat there wondering how on earth we were going to write this scene. We knew they'd actually gone there to have tea because we'd spoken to this very elderly woman who had served them. She said they were talking quite calmly to one another. But what dialogue do you put in their mouths at this particular moment, when this woman's about to be murdered? Well, the phone rang, and I got up to answer it and ended up stuck on this call for about 45 minutes, and I came back and Fran had written something. She asked me to check it out, and it was never revised: it's where she slides the plate with the last cake over to Honora, and says, "Go on, Mother, treat yourself." It was perfect.

I know you found Kate Winslet at an audition in England. How did you come across Melanie Lynskey, who played Pauline? I understand she was not a professional actress.

PJ: Well, it's one of those stories that sounds like it's not true. We wanted to cast someone in New Zealand, and we'd auditioned a lot of people-five or six hundred-who were either videotaped or photographed. I wanted to find someone who was young, around 1S or 16 years old; I didn't want a 23-year-old in a school uniform. And we wanted someone who was physically very much like the original Pauline; I have a thing about being as accurate as possible. So we quickly exhausted the professional actors in New Zealand who happened to look like Pauline-there's only about one or two. [laughs] We knew we were looking for someone with no experience, but we just had to find them. We kept saying, "Somewhere in New Zealand there's somebody who's perfect for this role."We were actually about four weeks away from beginning shooting, and we had one or two people on the short list, neither of whom we were happy with, but we were coming under enormous pressure to cast one of them, because, you know, the wardrobe department needed to make costumes, and so

on, and Fran said to me, "You're not really happy with the choices, are you?" And I said, "No." And she said, "This is crazy; we've spent all this time and energy on this film and we haven't found Pauline. This is something close to a major tragedy." I was in Christchurch, so Fran decided to drive with a casting person around the lower half of the North Island of New Zealand-she was prepared to drive as far as she had to. They'd visit every small town, go to the local school, visit the principal's office and show a photo of Pauline Parker. She'd say, "We're making a movie about Pauline Parker; do you have any pupils in your school who resemble her who might be interested in this?"

FW: We were in a rusting Ford Cortina, and we had no official I.D. We'd roll up to these provincial schools, and we'd be greeted by some curious teacher. Although no one ever once questioned our authenticity, we would always get asked about the car: "If you're in films, why aren't you driving

a Porsche?" [both laugh] So then I would pitch the story to the entire classroom, scanning the room the whole time, looking for sullen, brooding school girls, all the while thinking, "What would she look like with her hair dyed black?"

PJ: I guess that went on for about a week. Every night I'd get a call from Fran. Anyone that was vaguely appropriate was videotaped, and I got a couple of tapes in Christchurch, and it was a bit depressing. Finally, Fran called from a small town called New Plymouth, and said, "I think I've found someone very interesting. ' And this was Mel. We flew her down to Christchurch and gave her an audition and a screen test, and we cast her two weeks before the film started shooting. I called her mother up on a Friday night and said, "I'd really like Melanie to do the film." And she said, "When does she have to start?" And I said, "Well, she's got to come down here on Sunday." The poor girl didn't even get a chance to go back to school to clean out her locker.

Do you think there was any correspondence between the two actresses and their backgrounds and those of the characters they were playing?

PJ: One of the things that we knew about Pauline was that she was incredibly witty and intelligent, and Melanie was very similar-she was the top student in her province in many subjects. And we knew if we cast an intelligent person, then they were going to hit it. Melanie's also very enigmatic. The character of Pauline doesn't have an enormous amount of dialogue. In a sense, the real Pauline Parker speaks for her, through the diaries. So what we were looking for was an actress who has that kind of aspect to her that's a real movie-star thing: where you can film somebody sitting in a room, doing nothing, and they're still fascinating to watch. We found that in Mel.

I've read that you used actual locations for some of this.

PJ: As much as we could. The only location we couldn't use was Pauline's house, which had been torn down. Fortunately, the school is now a community center; the actual school moved to a different location, so they no longer had control over the buildings; otherwise we'd have definitely been refused

permission. The school buildings are now owned by the Christchurch City Council, which has done nothing to them; they're as they were 40 years ago. They just rent out the various rooms to community groups. We found out what classroom Pauline and Juliet actually were in, and it was the Canterbury

Women's Embroidery Guild-it sounds like something out of Monty Python-and we went into the room and right down one length of the wall was this huge tapestry that had been stretched out on this massive frame. I thought they would never want to take it down, but we managed to get them to do it. So that was the actual classroom where they were, down to the seating.The Ilam house, where Juliet lived, is still there. It's owned by the university, and they were very happy for us to use it. As for the doctor's surgery, where Pauline is interviewed by the doctor, we found out the address, and-you know, this is 40 years later, so you have no idea what to expect-it was just, like, a suburban house. We thought that was strange, in that it didn't seem like a doctor's office. Anyway, we knocked on the door, and the woman who answered happened to be the doctor's daughter-the doctor's long since dead-and we asked her where her father's office had been, and she said, "Oh, he had rooms out the back of the house here; we've never really touched them." We went into this doctor's surgery which was almost exactly the same as it had been 40 years before. So we ended up filming those sequences in the actual room where Pauline was interviewed by the doctor.We also spoke to the woman who was working at the tearooms at Victoria Park and found out exactly where they sitting, and filmed that scene there. Actually, about two months later, that building was demolished.

And what about the murder scene?

PJ: Well, we went to the murder site, and we just felt uncomfortable about filming there. It was very strange, and maybe it was just our imagination, but it was very quiet, very tranquil. I mean, all the way down the path you hear the wind and the birds, and suddenly, when you arrive at the spot, you hear nothing. So we filmed the murder scene at Victoria Park, but it was on a different track, about a hundred yards away.

There is one sequence of scenes in this script which didn't appear in the film. it begins with the tennis party at Ilam, in which Pauline and Juliet are watching from behind some shrubbery as Walter Perry and Hilda Hulme play tennis.

PJ: Well, that sequence was actually shot, and exists in the version of the film that was screened here in New Zealand. When Miramax released the film in the U.S., they had screenings and felt that the film was too long. We had final control over the film, but they pleaded with us to take out about 10 minutes' worth of footage, convinced that it would be tighter. We looked at it, and we actually, ultimately, agreed with them in a funny sort of way. That sequence slows the momentum down. It's quite a fun one to

read-and it's fun in the film as well-but it does slow things down at a point where we didn't think things should be slowing down. Although we've had control over the film's release all over the world, we've requested that the sequence be cut out of the versions screened in every other country. When you're writing a script, a part of you thinks, "Oh, this is perfect, we mustn't change a word of it," but once it's finished it takes a life of its own. We felt that the sequence wasn't telling us anything wedidn't already know about the characters, and at a time where the tension in Pauline's house was really growing, going over to Juliet's house to watch a tennis game was not necessary.

FW: I think when we wrote the script we felt it was very much Pauline and Juliet's story. After the edit, however, it became very evident to us that it was Pauline's story which was the through line and the audience's focal point. Whenever we veered too much into telling the Hulme story and Pauline wasn't on the screen, the pace started to flag. That was something we had to look at after the first assembly-we had to trim and cut Hulme scenes because they weren't as fundamentally interesting as the Rieper scenes.

Although this film is very different from Braindead, both take place in the New Zealand of the 1950s. I'm not that familiar with your country, but from watching these two films I would have to assume that it was, at least in that period, a fairly repressive kind of society, acting almost as a breeding ground for transgression, for explosive kinds of behavior.

PJ: Well, the script for Braindead was set in the modern day up until the very last minute. I was worried going into the movie that the hero of the film, named Lionel, acted in a fairly nerdy kind of way-he doesn't socialize, he takes care of his mother-and yet we wanted him to be the empathetic character in the film. I was afraid that if it was set in the modern day, the audience-especially a young audience-would really jeer at this character, and not be able to relate to him at all. If we set it inthe '50s, people might actually feel more sympathy for him, because they would think, "Well, that sort of thing happened then." With Heavenly Creatures, it was really just a coincidence that the actual event had taken place then.

FW: But that repression is still very much in evidence here: we're I not expressive, we're not demonstrative, we're scared of showing, saying too much. When you go to New York, for instance, and people are yelling and the horns are blaring-if that happened here, someone would get out of theircar, rip open your door and bash you up. There's a level of violence, a subtext of violence, running through New Zealand society that comes out in our movies. We have a veneer of being easygoing, but underneath, we're full of rage. It's an interesting social dynamic. and it makes for interesting art, but it's not so pleasant to actually live in it. It's very much to do with a link with England- PJ: Christchurch in particular.

FW: Christchurch suffers from it more than any other city in New Zealand. It's always been described as "a little piece England"; it's considered to be more English than England. It's always aspired to be that, and it still is in some ways.

PJ: The thing with this murder, too, is that the sense you when you talk to the older generation in Christchurch is that it was an embarrassment to the city, that it was somehow shameful and somehow humiliating. Which is ridiculous, because the story is ultimately a family tragedy.

FW: It's been said that Christchurch was more appalled by revelation that Pauline's parents were not married than by the murder itself. And some uncharitable souls even suggested that one sinful act led on to the other.

Speaking generally about your films, you both seem to have a certain love of campiness, which is apparent in the use of caricatures for many characters, as well as in an overall sort of extremism reminiscent of the work of someone like John Waters here in the U.S. What's interesting about Heavenly Creatures is that while it remains a fundamentally "realistic" docudrama, some of the figures of authority, like the doctor, the vicar and the headmistress, are hilariously overplayed.

PJ: Well, I like movies to be entertaining, to be a little larger than life. With something like Braindead, obviously there's no problem doing that. But with 'Heavenly Creatures,' we were telling what we hoped would be a fairly accurate story. At the same time, however, I still wanted to make a movie; I didn't want something totally tied to real life, and totally dull. So we did have a little bit of fun with some of those characters. I guess if you were trying to justify it you could say we were presenting them from the girls' point of view, but that's not strictly true. I just think that there were really only two people who we needed to be realistic with, and they were Juliet and Pauline, both of whom were slightly larger than life anyway. That's something that came across in the interviews with their classmates. They were remembered as being sort of terrifying: Juliet was so confident and loud, and Pauline was brooding and dark. So, in a sense, the film was a perfect one for us. I don't Like doing stuff that's totally naturalistic. I just like having a little bit of fun.

The fantasy sequences are written pretty much as they appeared on film. Were you aware of how, technically, you were going to handle these special effects as you were writing?

PJ: Pretty much. We hadn't used any optical or digital effects in Braindead, and with Heavenly Creatures, I knew that if I actually wrote digital effects into the script, then it was a great excuse to go out and get this new equipment-I have my own special effects company. So right at the beginning we wrote stuff that could only be done with morphing. We got one computer and hired someone to figure out how it all worked.

What about your use of the Plasticine figures? Was that something you'd heard the girls were interested in?

PJ: Yeah, we interviewed several people who remembered that they used to model figures in Plasticine, and I think HERBERT 
Rieper refers to it in his court testimony. We also interviewed an old guy who had been round to the Hulme's place and had seen Juliet's Plasticine horses on the mantelpiece.

And, of course, there are endless passages in the diaries about Borovnia, and Diello, the murderous prince and all of that. When we thought it would be fun right at the beginning to go into some of these fantasy sequences, the last thing I wanted to do was dress up actors in medieval costumes and

crowns and have them looking like something out of a school play. So we decided it would be really fun to tie the Plasticine figures and Borovnia together. And we knew they'd sculpted figures like Diello, so we just thought, why not have those figures come to life, as it were.

What about the linking of certain actors to certain figures, like Orson Welles to Diello?

PJ: Well, that was something that we devised ourselves. But again, that springs from the fact that the girls used to give pet names to people. Like one of the boarders in the diary, for instance, is referred to as John for a while, and then his name changed to Nicholas.

That's referred to in the scene in Pauline's sleepout.

PJ: Yeah, and for some reason, Pauline refers to him as Nicholas in the rest of her diary. That happened with a lot of people. They were clearly using real, live people as prototypes for some of their fantasy characters. We figured that Diello had a lot of qualities that they seemed to fear in Orson Welles. He seemed to represent some sort of dark, sexual force, so we figured that giving his features to the figure of Diello was appropriate.

Could you talk about the fact that, during production, Anne Perry, the mystery writer, was "outed " as being Juliet Hulme?

FW: Well, where do you start? We knew that would be a possible outcome of making this film-that someone might try and track down either Pauline or Juliet. Which was a very good reason not to make the movie. We had more compelling reasons to make the film, however, because if we didn't, anotherone was going to get made anyway. There were, at the time the film was being funded, five competing projects in various states of preparation.

Didn't Dustin Hoffman have something in the works?

FW: His company, Punch Productions, I believe, had a script written by an American writer; Peter had, in fact, been very tentatively approached to read it, that was how we found out about it. At that point we were about a week away from starting to shoot. And then someone was trying to do a film version of the play we've already spoken of, and other people were developing a very politicized lesbian version of the story. Then there'd been a screenplay written by the late English novelist, Angela Carter, that was with a production company in Auckland, and there was someone in Australia developing a screenplay. So we knew that this story was going to come to the screen, soon-there was no doubt someone was going to make it. And we felt that, in that climate, we would proceed, despite the possibility that these women might be exposed.We knew that in Pauline's case it was less likely. We'd heard a lot of rumor and gossip about Juliet, but we'd heard nothing about Pauline, and I think she has very carefully hidden her identity. Juliet went to no such trouble: she took her stepfather's name-Hilda Hulme ended up marrying Walter Perry-as a novelist, and proceeded to write a series of crime novels. You can look up any contemporary author index in any library, and there is Anne Perry, and her birthdate is the same as Juliet Hulme's, her mother's maiden name is the same, etc. There is a gap in her personal history, where she leaves out New Zealand, but it picks up again after she left the country. So it didn't take a huge amount of detective work from the journalist here in New Zealand who had heard that Anne Perry and JulietHulme were one and the same.

That rumor sprang from a production of the play that had gone on here a year before we started shooting, where a friend of Juliet's, who was still writing to her, confided in one of the actors that Juliet Hulme was now writing murder mysteries as Anne Perry. That rumor hew around the acting community here in New Zealand, and it reached our ears on the set, and it was something that we wanted to entirely disassociate ourselves from, because we knew it would damage the film, and we knew it would damage us. It was inevitable that we would be accused of exploiting this woman's situation in order to promote the movie. When this journalist rang Peter and asked what comment he had about the story, he just begged her not to print it. Of course that was a hopeless situation, because she was a tabloid hack who was going to go ahead and make her name, and she has dined off it ever since. We felt an enormous amount of dread, because the movie hadn't had a chance to stand on its own before this was made known, and it's now been inextricably linked with this revelation. So we've been battling that ever since. But given that it's happened, we've had to deal with it, as she has.

PJ: I mean, we were absolutely disgusted by some of the ads Miramax ran. On the day that this was released in America, I rang Miramax and said, "For heaven's sake, don't associate this film with any of this because we don't approve of this publicity." And a couple of months later, lo and behold, we

get sent by a friend in the States clippings with these ads saying, "Murder, She Wrote," and these other references to Anne Perry that Miramax had been running, and we were just very, very angry.

Did you fever consider using the coordinates of the actual event, but changing enough of the particulars to push it into the fictional realm?

PJ: No, because the case is so well-known in New Zealand; it would be like-

FW: Fictionalizing the O.J. Simpson case.

PJ: It's unnecessary. I mean, sure, if it was just a movie for international consumption, then, yeah. But the fact is that we weren't actually making this film for an international audience. We were very much

making it to try and rectify 40 years of misunderstanding about this case within New Zealand. In a way that was our main motivation for making the film, and in doing that, we obviously had to use their real names. But having said that, "Pauline Parker" and "Juliet Hulme" ceased to exist as people in 1959, because they both took different names. In a sense, I don't think there was any moral problem with using those names, because they themselves stopped using them some 30-odd years ago.

Were there any other films you looked at as inspiration before writing this?

FW: Well, we looked at movies like Let Him Have It, which was based on the Craig/Bentley murder case in England [Bentley was an 18-year-old with a low I.Q. who was hanged for murder]. Although I think that film has quite a lot of merit, in the end it comes across as a grim, dark, true-life murder

story, and similarly Dance with a Stranger, which was about Ruth Ellis [the last woman to be hanged in England]. We felt that if there was one thing we didn't want to do, it was to make a depressing murder film. We really wanted to tell a tale of a friendship, rather than a murder story. Sure, the movie ends with a murder, but for the most part, it celebrates friendship.

PJ: We wanted to make it a lot funnier than those films. And people have said, "It's such a serious subject; why did you try to make it funny?" Well, obviously the murder wasn't funny, and we never attempted to make it funny, but the friendship was funny. Life is funny: generally, human beings

like to enjoy themselves, and there was no doubt that Pauline and Juliet had a hell of a good time, most of the time.

FW: But the other reason why it was important that we tell this as a true story is that it has a kind of universal truth for anybody growing up. When you're at that age, you become very focused on things in an extreme way. And I don't think Pauline and Juliet are so very different from anybody else; I think several things went wrong in their lives-Juliet's parents broke up, and Pauline became very alienated from her family (she was an obsessional manic-depressive character)-and I think it was this terriblecombination of things that led to this extraordinarily horrible act. But it's not something that can be precluded from anybody's experience in growing up. Adolescence is such a crazy time.

PJ: A lot of women have come up to us and said, "I was Pauline. That was me. That was my childhood." I don't think it's that unusual. I think what is unusual about the whole thing is that these aspects of Pauline's character led to the murder, and I don't think the sort of person she was was particularly unusual or freakish or weird. When we hear things like that, it's the best possible endorsement we could get.

THE HEAVY METAL MOVIE 

- Final Draft -







								SCREENPLAY BY

								Dan Goldberg

								and

								Len Blum






								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE 
                 Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You gotta use the microphone.


 ZEKE 
                 Oh yeah.
                 (shouts into microphone)
                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.
                 Here we go.


ZEKE jams the gearshift into hyper-drive.

The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed

ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spacecraft looks like an apple
heading toward a freight train as it approaches the
enormous mother-ship.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL CONSOLE 
An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console.  ZEKE is
at the controls with a joint in his mouth.  He is swaying
back and forth, eyes glazed.  Beside him, EDSEL watches
the mothership getting closer.


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You okay to land this thing?


 ZEKE 
                 No problem, man.

Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide
landing area as the round spaceship glides in.

                 man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - ENTRANCE HATCH 
ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 This man is to be delivered to the,

                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.

As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.


 EDSEL (V.O.)

                 up, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.)

 EDSEL (V.O.)

GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT 
                 ... but I don't understand.  We
                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA

                 leave it at that.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside

 ZEKE

                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,

 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO

The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of
                 human goodness ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,
                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE

 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.

 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you

The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.)

FISTE nods.


 ZEKE

                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
them.


 ZEKE 
                 There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang
                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP 
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse
floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,
approaching the mammoth structure.


 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of
                 human goodness ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,
                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 1


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          MANHATTAN. 10.30 P.M.
          Park Avenue in mid-December. On the lampposts, Xmas lights
          sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines
          line up for a public function.

          2 EXT. BLACKWOOD BUILDING - NIGHT 2


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          BLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE
          Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos
          and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a
          sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE.
          A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His
          features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
          The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the
          security people at the door.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          (in Elvish, subtitled)
          I'll go up first. You'll enter from below-
          He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin
          and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right
          hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A
          plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth.

          SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D)
          And remember Wink-

          (BEAT)
          Don't be shy.
          He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall,
          up, up, like a bat. Five floors up...

          HELLBOY 2 2

          AUCTIONEER
          Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in granite
          and has been dated circa 700 B.C.
          Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear.
          TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders
          can have a closer look.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          We'll open the bidding at two hundred
          thousand dollars.
          A DISTINGUISHED BUYER raises his hand-

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Two hundred and seventy-five, and... we
          have three hundred, thank you Mr. Van
          Hausen - Three hundred thousand once-
          A FEMALE BIDDER raise her hand-

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          And Three hundred and fifty thousand,
          thank you Mrs. Bernstein-
          As the auction carries on, a STEWARD leaves the room and
          heads down -

          4 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4

          -a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots
          to and from the sales room.
          The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the
          corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a
          snow-covered alley.
          Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame,
          clinging to the smooth granite wall!!

          STEWARD
          What the h-
          Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's
          mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has

          VANISHED!!!
          The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels,
          hauling him outside and dangling him over the void.
          Far below: a spiked wrought-iron fence.

          A silent human- almost as good as a dead
          one...

          (BEAT)
          Almost.
          He releases the STEWARD, who falls-

          -DOWN-

          Two STEWARDS wheel in an oaken box and open it. Nestled in

          A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the
          first time in auction. A piece of the
          Royal Crown of Bethmoora... A precious
          artifact dating from the Atrebatean
          period. Exquisite workmanship in 24 carat
          gold.
          The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the
          audience.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Please- please- ladies and gentlemen...
          may I have your attention. As I was
          saying, observe the fanciful creatures
          adorning the outer surface, figures from
          a lost mythology...
          The lights go out completely. From the sudden darkness, the
          Shadowy Figure speaks up.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          Lost- ? Not at all. Forgotten by you
          perhaps, but very much alive.

          A few emergency lights come on, revealing The Shadowy
          Figure, who walks down the aisle to confront the auctioneer.

          Sir, would you please identify yourself?
          I see no badge or-

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          Shall we just say that I am the rightful
          owner of this piece?
          He seizes the artifact. The auctioneer grabs a phone and
          hits a button.

          Security- Call Security-
          This is an outrage- An-

          handful of seeds at the Auctioneer's feet.

          KRRRRR-K the seeds sprout into massive, thick branches and
          roots and instantly engulfing the Auctioneer amidst coils of
          wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and grow until they
          crack the ceiling!!
          Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and in its place stands a
          compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from its
          branches and crawl around the trunk.
          CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS come flying through the side
          doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!! The spectators
          scream.
          WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on his back.
          On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the
          metal.
          People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and
          disbelief.
          WINK shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a CLANG!!!!
          Inside them, little clawed THINGS are scrabbling - mewling,
          fast and hungry!!
          At the Shadowy Figure's signal, the troll opens the cages...
          and the people's SCREAMS redouble.

          A Christmas tree glows next to the fireplace; Mozart is
          playing on the aquarium's underwater speakers. Floating in
          warm water on a cloud of bubbles is ABE SAPIEN, lost in the
          music.
          A blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against
          the tank: It's TOM MANNING, chief FBI liaison to the BPRD.
          Looking dyspeptic, he presses a folder against the glass:

          TOP SECRET.

          As they walk down the hall, manning shows Abe.

          MANNING
          Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune
          to suppress. And then, naturally, they
          pop up on the net.
          CAMERA moves in on Abe's breathing apparatus. It's sleek,
          more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck. His
          goggles are new, too.
          He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street,
          brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan. He's looking
          straight at the camera lens.

          I know- It's not just the money. It's the
          provocation. This is asking for trouble.

          Manning leans close to a voice-recognition security mike.

          MANNING
          "Man-ning..."
          He enunciates each syllable perfectly, then turns to Abe.

          MANNING (CONT'D)
          -is out of control. And I think it's all
          deliberate on his part.

          How are things between him and Liz?

          ABE
          Oh, you know. The usual. Since they moved
          in together- Good days and bad.
          On cue, the concrete wall explodes!'.! A massive BALL OF FIRE
          swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it off its
          hinges.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Then again, there are the really bad days-
          Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion
          dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back
          smoking and in flames.

          Liz appears, shimmering in a halo of blue flame.
          HB's pulls a few LP albums out of the garbage bin.

          LIZ
          You have the same album on CD, LP and an

           You can't listen to Al Green on a CD!!
           You just can't!! Oh, and 8 track was the
           way to go- one day mankind will realize
           its mistake.

          LIZ
          What about me? I need some space! Not
          much, but just enough to find- to find-
          my- toothbrush.
          She flares up, losing control...

          HELLBOY
          Is that what this is about?? Your
          toothbrush's right there, behind you-

          There- there- with the cat food!!
          Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from

          They move into a vast garage, big as a stadium. It houses a

          They load weapons and ammo on board their usual

          MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of creatures emerge
          from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing.

          wallpaper, the furniture!
          The things sweep over Agent Mudd, ripping into him like
          wriggling piranhas.

          ABE

          Oh, my-

          25 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 25

          Hellboy protects the other agent, but he feels the things
          swarming over him, reaching for his lips and ears...
          Bellowing in disgust, he fires his shotguns, splattering
          dozens of creatures onto the walls.
          Every blast, however, reveals a buzzing, hungry mass pouring
          from the walls. HB claws at dozens more, which cling to him
          like baby monkeys.

          26 INT. SALES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 26

          The room is awash with hissing creatures, crawling over the
          iron cages. For an awful moment, no sign of Liz or Abe.

          HELLBOY
          (sudden panic)

          LIZ!!
          In reply, he hears a faint scream. He bats at the things
          with the SHOTGUN, wading further into the room.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Liz!! Where are you - ?!
          He sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars
          of a cage...
          .Liz cowering inside. Hellboy just has time to look deep
          into her eyes. A quick moment of silent communion.

          HELLBOY
          Do it, Liz, do it!!!
          And Liz obeys. Closing her eyes she-

          LIZ

          The fire's not my enemy. It is part of me-
          -gets covered by a gentle film of blue flame.

          UH-OH-
          He takes refuge as-

          LIZ
          It is mine-
          -the gentle flame blooms into a cloud of fire. Liz goes
          supernova. BAMMM!!!

          27 EXT. AUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT 27

          A ball of fire erupts from an upstairs balcony. The crowd
          and reporters look up, amazed.

          MANNING

          (MUTTERING)
          Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
          somewhere in-
          The reporters stampede towards the explosion, leaving
          Manning alone and fuming.

          Hellboy stomps down hard, popping some creatures, bashing
          others with the butt of his shotgun. As flames leap up, the
          things regroup and renew their attack.
          Liz and Abe run for the stairs.

          LIZ
          Red, Red, this way-
          Hellboy kicks the critters away, shooting again and again.

          HELLBOY
          No- I'll deal with them- NOW.
          He dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of VULCAN 66
          grenades. Holds it high.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Vulcan 66, boys! Come and get 'em-
          Liz and Abe take cover on the stairs. They see Hellboy
          luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the
          street.

          10
          As the creatures climb onto him, he pulls the pins on all
          grenades. Soon he's a mass of swarming, gnarly fairies and

          THEN-

          LIZ

          No, Red- Not there! Move away from the-

          29 TNT / EXT - AUCTION HOUSE 29
          Like a cannonball, HB flies out the upper floor window.
          A ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting,
          writhing fairies.
          Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands
          in their midst, cracking the pavement.

          Liz and Abe go to the window and look down. A TV CAMERA LENS

          ZOOMS IN ON THEM BOTH.

          HB?? HB?? Are you alright??

          31 EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT 31

          The crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies
          climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd.
          People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters
          jumps at a woman but-
          BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and
          efficiently shoots its fellows.
          Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds
          it up by the tail, like a rodent.
          Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A
          sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          (looks at Manning)
          Gee whiz, Manning-

          34 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT 34

          Guard 1 watches TV. HB is on the screen, surrounded by press
          and TV.

          GUARD 1
          Check it out. That guy's make-up is so
          fake. I mean, come on, solid red-
          Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.

          GUARD 2
          And what's with his forehead? Is that
          goggles?
          He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
          standing by the gates.

           GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
           Hey, we got us a wino.
           He grabs his nightstick and steps outside.

           35

          35 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHT

           Waving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder.
          Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall.

          GUARD 2
          Hey- buddy- get the-
          The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
          unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
          guard.
          The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
          and collapses.

          36

          36 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT

          Guard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
          -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
          appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
          off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!

          BAMMKM ! ! ! !
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled
          remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard.
          WINK emerges from behind the shack.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 19
          Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
          and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
          follows him through.

          37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37

          A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
          Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
          helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
          After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
          show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
          follow me, Sire.

          38 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 38

          The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
          guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
          intersection.
          The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          I beg you, your majesty. Before entering
          the chamber you surrender your sword.

          PRINCE
          I will not.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Then, I regret to say, you may not see
          your father. It is the protocol, sire.
          For peasant and prince alike. Please- for
          the last time- surrender your sword.
          A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
          The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-

          PRINCE
          Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
          weapon. He will wait here-
          WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a
          huge, rusting iron door.

          39 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39

          An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
          High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
          goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
          At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
          and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
          Prince's sister.
          Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
          dangles from a chain.
          Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
          fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
          YANG, almost the same being.
          The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
          guards watch his every move.
          He bows his head and kneels.

          PRINCE
          Father.
          (eyes the Princess)

          SISTER-
          The KING gestures for him to rise.

          KING
          Why have you done this??
          His voice trembles with anger.

          KING (CONT'D)
          Why? !
          The Prince looks at him, defiant.

          PRINCE
          I have returned from exile to set us
          free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
          what has been taken from our people. The
          land and the freedom that is rightfully
          ours.

          KING
          No- You have broken a truce that has
          lasted for centuries.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 21

          PRINCE
          A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can
          you abide it? How- ? They have no respect
          for themselves, their Gods or the earth-

          (BEAT)
          And they scorn us- every time they raise
          a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
          or take more land-
          The PRINCESS then steps forward.

          PRINCESS
          What they do is in their nature. We must
          honor our side of the agreement-

          PRINCE
          Honor-?

          (BEAT)
          Look at this place. Is this where you
          hold court??

          (BEAT )
          Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
          filth, in their rubble??? Picking at
          scraps from their table??? Where is the
          honor in that??

          KING
          And what would your solution be-? War?
          Why?

          (PAUSE)
          It may just be that our days are ended...

          PRINCE
          It may be- but we will not go quiet. We
          will not fade like this. Better to burn
          than fade away... And for this...
          Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
          the clans.

          PRINCE
          .we'll need the help of the Good... the
          Bad... and the Worst-
          He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
          high.
          The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
          companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.

          KING
          No- you cannot be that mad-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 22

          PRINCE
          Yes. I am.

          KING
          This is the path you wish to take?
          Knowing the cost?

          PRINCE
          Yes, Father- it is.
          The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
          head.

          KING
          Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
          choice.
          (looks at his guards)
          Death.
          His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.

          PRINCE

          (GRIM)
          I agree. Death it is-
          And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
          Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
          tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
          flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.

          PRINCE
          Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
          that have already seen the light-
          (he nears the guards)
          Seen the future...
          The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
          his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          As for you- You may join us in our quest
          or die now-
          His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
          they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
          NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
          seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises

          IT-

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          All of those in favor, make it known.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 23
          All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then
          kneel.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          Good- I see the council is as brave as
          it's always been...

          (BEAT)
          And now, my sister-
          The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
          He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.

           PRINCE (CONT'D)
           Find her- Find her-
           His minions surge into the tunnels.

          40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40
           Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
          down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
          she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
          With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
          a chute.
          She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.

          41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41

          The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
          ancient, leather-bound tome.
          She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
          surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
          sword.
          It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-

          42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42

          The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
          GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a
          wound in his left arm.

          PRINCE
          No- no- you fools-

           As another troll lifts his sword high-

           PRINCESS
           (calling out)
           Yrdrig!!
          YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
          alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
          seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
          Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
          shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
          The Princess slips through a secret door.

          44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44

          The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
          screams echo off the walls.
          When they finally-

          45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45

          -reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
          Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.
          The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his
          bleeding arm.

          CUT TO:

          46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46

          Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in
          Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of
          Heliboy's "outing" the night before.
          HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph!

          HELLBOY ON TV
          Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've
          fought many creatures over the years but
          none as strong as me-
          He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 25
          Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of
          beer.

          HELLBOY
          I think I did good. And I looked good,
          don't you think, Liz?
          Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls.

          ABE
          Look- there's Manning...
          He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by
          microphones.

          MANNING ON TV
          Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
          somewhere in-

          HELLBOY
          A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it.
          The door opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box
          overflowing with mail.

          MANNING

          PLEASE-
          Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV's.

          MANNING
          Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you
          hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun.
          Only Liz-

          (BEAT)
          Only Liz handled herself with any
          dignity.

          LIZ
          (glancing at HB)
          No one asked me anything.
          Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a
          table.

          MANNING
          Don't bother starting a fan club. It's
          trending five to one against us.

          HELLBOY
          Against?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 26

          LIZ
          (glances at some letters)
          Polls- protests- hate mail-
          Liz grabs a few letters and scans them.

          LIZ

          (READING)
          "Unwelcome species... mongrelizing...
          lower orders... ungodly freaks..."
          She glares at Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          Ungodly freaks-? Us?

          MANNING
          You really did it this time- I'm under
          review.
          (to Hellboy)
          But so are you- As of today, there's a
          new team leader.

          HELLBOY
          New - ? What?

           MANNING
           Yes- You heard me. A new team leader.
           We're to meet him at the conference room
          at 0900-
           (looks at his watch)
          Now.

          47 INT. SECURITY POUND BPRD - SAME 47

          The SECURITY POUND is row after row of stacked cages, each
          one imprisoning a different CREATURE. BPRD AGENTS patrol the
          pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans-
          HB looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous.

          HELLBOY
          What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you
          trust me anymore?

          MANNING
          Oh- I never did- But after last night,
          Washington wants a new public face for
          the BPRD-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 27

          HELLBOY
          What about me? What's wrong with my
          face???

          MANNING
          Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now
          you've ruined it all-

          HELLBOY
          But, who-? Who is this guy?

          MANNING
          How would I know? Evidently, he's quite
          the big shot-
          (he reads a file)
          His name is Johann Kraus-

          HELLBOY
          Akkk- Kraus??? He's German-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a physical medium, head of the European
          branch of the BPRD-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          You know I have a problem with Germans-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult
          Practice from the University of Munich
          and a very eloquent speaker-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -Germans make me nervous-

          MANNING
          I guess they need a nice open face- A
          face people can trust.
          Finally, next to steel cage, they meet-
          JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment
          suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick
          latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his
          head...

          MANNING
          . Oh, my God-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 28
          .is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas!
          He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the
          Fairy Cages.
          Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows.

          JOHANN
          Johann Kraus, at your service.
          His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing.
          Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns
          toward them.

          HELLBOY
          (whispers to manning)
          That's an open face for you...

          48 INT. CONTAINMENT AREA - DAY 48

          Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy
          and the others gather around him.

          JOHANN
          Poor things, bought and sold on the black
          market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages.
          Let's see what they can remember-

          HELLBOY
          Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die-
          (nudges Abe)
          -but maybe I can be of help-
          Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet.

          JOHANN
          Oh, no, no- No amulets are required.
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          What are you doing?

          JOHANN
          I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,

          MECHANICAL-

          HELLBOY

          INHABIT-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 29

          ABE

          TELEPLASTY-

          JOHANN
          Exactly.
          A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips,
          slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the-
          -"Dead" Fairy.

          JOHANN
          I can briefly take control of entities,
          both mechanical and organic and
          reactivate their neural system-
          The "dead" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two
          more do the same from another pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (points at Hellboy)
          You scare him-
          The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB.

          HELLBOY
          (leering at it)
          Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of
          my tail- Yes, you-

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Rough translation: He says you are rude,
          brutish and not too bright-

          ABE
          Touche.
          More high-pitched jabbering...
          Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Enough. it seems our little friend here
          remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise
          in the last place where his cage was
          traded: market sounds-

          (BEAT)
          Troll language-

          LIZ
          The troll market- ?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 30

          JOHANN
          Exactly, Miss Sherman.
          The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and
          weak.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too
          good.

          JOHANN
          I'm losing my grip on its limbic system-
          He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about
          to die-

          HELLBOY
          Wow- You have that effect on me too.
          The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses.
          Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's
          fingertips.

          ABE
          How can we find the Troll market??? Its
          location has been a source of speculation
          for centuries

          JOHANN
          Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges-
          And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist-
          places it under Washington Bridge

          ABE
          We've looked there before-- Staked it out
          for weeks-

          JOHANN
          Yes, but this time I have asked for a
          very special piece of equipment-
          He moves in to a large crate marked "Lot 336"

          ABE
          "336" The schufftein glasses??

          JOHANN
          (smiles knowingly)
          On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we
          have this clue-
          He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 31

          JOHANN
          In my mind we have enough to go by- Any
          questions??
          Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises
          his hand-

          JOHANN
          Yes- what is it?

          HELLBOY
          If you're really German- how come you
          don't have a funny accent?

          JOHANN

          (SIGHS)
          Get ready. We are on the move.

          49

          49 INT. GARAGE AREA / DRESSING LOCKER ROOMS

          Hellboy is suiting up. Liz and Abe do the same.

          HELLBOY
          What a moron!! "We are on the move" He
          thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking
          for that place for years and we've never
          found it-
          (looks at Abe)
          You said so-
          Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of
          copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He
          tries it on.

          LIZ
          Get used to it. He might be here for good-

          HELLBOY
          For good?!

          LIZ
          He has a nice voice.

          ABE
          Yes, very commanding, very soothing.

          HELLBOY
          I think he's a jerk.

          ABE
          I like him.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 32

          HELLBOY
          Well, then you're a jerk, too. "The
          brains of the operation-" give me a
          break!

          JOHANN
          They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and
          are waiting there.

          LIZ
          I think you feel threatened...
           Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard.

           CUT TO:

          50 EXT. WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT 50

           The Garbage truck and a few other BPRD vehicles crossthe
          Washington Bridge on the way to CHINATOWN.

          SIGN: WASHINGTON BRIDGE 21.00 HOURS

          51 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - NIGHT 51

          Hellboy rides in silence- still thinking hard- then.

          HELLBOY
          Ha! Me? Threatened??
          Glaring, at Liz:

          HELLBOY
          By whom? By him??

          LIZ
          Not just him- this whole thing you did.
          The TV- the reporters-

          HELLBOY
          I did that?

          LIZ
          Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it
          without thinking- You just wanted to be
          in the public's eye- well- you're there-
          but so are we.

          HELLBOY
          Hey- We got some hate mail.

          (SHRUGS)
          We'll deal with it. Together.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 33
          He comes closer to her.

          HELLBOY
          Something else bothering you-?
          Liz nods quietly.

          HELLBOY
          So- Tell me about it-

          LIZ
          I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I-

          (BEAT)
          I don't like being watched. I never have.
          I feel like a freak only if someone's
          watching me.
          Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and
          fenders.
          The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and TV
          CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally,
          hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan,
          UK, Germany...

          CUT TO:

          52 EXT. WATERFRONT, BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 52

          Agents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the
          press at bay. As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders
          push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy.
          Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying
          support/hatred signs.

          MANNING
          May I suggest that tonight you refrain
          from signing autographs.

          HELLBOY
          It's the garbage truck. It makes the
          wrong statement. About who we are.

          MANNING
          You think that's what this is about?
          Transportation???

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 34

          53 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS - NIGHT 53

          The truck stops near other official vehicles. Overhead, the
          soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge.
          At the sight of the BPRD team, some protestors throw eggs.
          Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage.

          REPORTER 2
          C'mon- show us your powers-

          ABE
          Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick.

          REPORTER 1
          What are you, a mermaid??

          ABE
          Oh, goodness, no- I-

          REPORTER 2
          You say you can read things- things about
          people- so read me- c'mon- read me-
          The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds.

          REPORTER 2 (CONT'D)
          What do you see?

          ABE
          Very well, if you insist.
          (webbed hand on reporter's chest)
          You... keep... a large, battery-operated
          vibrating egg by your bedside...
          A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment.

          REPORTER
          You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test?

          HELLBOY
          It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"-
          One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy
          gazes back at them- seething.

          JOHANN
          Let me take care of this.
          Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 35

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann
          Kraus and I beg you to allow us-
          (interrupted by catcalls)
          -Please, we need space to work- please-

          WE-
          The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He signals for
          silence.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          In due time- very soon- we will provide
          all the answers you require, all the
          whos, whys and wherefors- But for now-
          An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars-

          HELLBOY
          Great P.R...
          He gets ready to pummel the crowd. Liz stops him.

          LIZ
          Shh! Give him a chance...

          JOHANN
          -it's been a long... long time... for
          many decades really, that the BPRD has
          served you- all of you... in silence. We
          have waged an unknown war - but a very
          real one. Heroes have died unrewarded and
          unrecognized so that you might go about
          your daily life. To work, to marry, to
          bid your children goodnight.
          Little by little, the crowd grows quiet.

          JOHANN
          In exchange, we have been consigned to
          the lies and racist innuendo of the
          tabloids. And there we have lived without
          complaint - until now.

          54

          54 MONTAGE
          Johann's speech is replayed in broadcast TV VANS, HOMES,

          population. All colors and creeds.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 36

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          But perhaps soon- after learning of our
          hardships and sacrifices, you may decide
          that our humble lives may, in some way,
          have a value... and a meaning-

          - DOCKS - NIGHT 55

          55 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE

          The camera lights reflect off Johann's glass head.

          JOHANN
          I pray that you will allow us to defend
          your good fortune- to guarantee the
          blessing that is a peaceful night's
          sleep. A night free from monsters and
          nightmares. And if so-
          (chokes back tears)
          If so- then all we ask in return... from
          you... is a little respect and the
          chance, remote as it may be, to prove
          ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in
          this- God's Earth.

          HELLBOY
          (rolls his eyes)
          This is sooo corny-
          A moment of silence ensues--
          Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds-
          Liz applauds, Abe applauds. Hellboy is agog!!

          HELLBOY
          What-?? What-??

          ABE

          (DAZZLED)
          He has a nice voice.
          All business now, Johann steps over to the group.

          JOHANN
          Come on. We have work to do-

          56

          56 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          Hellboy, Abe and Johann peer over the cornice of a bowling
          alley rooftop. The CROWDS are visible in the distance.
          Hellboy looks through THE SCHUFFTEN GLASSES.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 37

          HELLBOY
          Nothing yet, Sparky, over-

          57

          57 EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          The BPRD truck is parked behind the bowling alley, directly
          under the bridge. Its back door is open; Liz and manning are
          at the communications center.

          LIZ
          I read you, Red. Keep looking-
          Manning is bored, looks at his watch.

          MANNING
          Looking at what, for goodness sake-?
          (looks at the Schufften glasses)
          What do these things do-?
          Liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses and
          prisms. Both Abe and Johan wear similar gear.

          ABE
          In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of
          Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical
          sets with the intent of photographing
          fairies in England...

          MANNING
          Let's get out of here- We're never going
          to find it-

          HELLBOY'S VOICE
          Hey- Sparky, I think we got one.
          Manning studies the image on the monitor: a bag lady pushing
          a shopping cart full of cats-

          MANNING
          That? Oh, please, she looks as sweet as
          she can-

          LIZ
          Red, turn on the "antiglamour" filter...
          (to Manning)
          Fairy folk use a spell called "glamour"
          to seem human and nice-

          (BEAT)
          These lenses allow you to see their real
          appearance...

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 38
          ,,f 58 EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT 58
          Bellboy turns a few knobs on the goggles, then raises them.

          59

          59 POV GOGGLES.
          As a series filters enter the visual field, the bag lady
          transforms into an ugly, muscle-bound troll.

          60

          60 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME


          MANNING
          Oh, dear Lord.

          (PAUSE)
          What about the cats?

          LIZ
          She eats them.

          MANNING
          "She??" That's a "she"?????

          HELLBOY
          We're moving in, Sparky-

          61 BOWLING ALLEY / BACK ALLEY/ UNDER THE BRIDGE 61
          HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service

          DOOR-

          / SERVICE CORRIDOR. 62

          62 INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          The bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and
          through a basement door. The room RUMBLES with the sound of
          rolling balls and toppling pins.

          HELLBOY

          (WHISPERS)
          Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh?

          ABE
          (splays his webbed fingers)
          Bowling balls- they give me trouble.

          HELLBOY
          How about a beer, then? Now that we're
          "out"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 39

          JOHANN
          Sorry. I don't drink.

          HELLBOY

          SHEESH-

          63 INT. BOWLING ALLEY BASEMENT 63

          Hellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old
          woman. Just a Warehouse-

          JOHANN'
          Adjust the prisms to "2"
          Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own-
          unsuccessfully.
          Now the WHOLE ROOM transforms under the new optical
          elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but
          instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy
          rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree
          trunks and stone columns are visible...

          ABE

          THERE-
          Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical
          lock.

          HELLBOY
          What the heck is that?

          ABE
          A locking mechanism-

          HELLBOY
          Mmh- I'll take care of it-
          He clenches his stone fist, rears back...

          JOHANN
          No- You destroy it. We'll never get in-
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch-

          JOHANN
          Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the-

          64 MECHANISM OF THE LOCK

          65

          65 THE LOCK
          Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase.
          Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off
          the valves.

          JOHANN
          Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.

          66 INT. TROLL MARKET - NIGHT 66

          Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare. A labyrinth of
          narrow alleys and foetid vapour.
          Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking
          through garbage, scattering vermin.
          Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy
          puddles.
          Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and
          century.
          At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
          cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
          Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
          A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
          of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
          while violent bettors laugh and shout.
          At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in
          rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse
          of her slippered feet...
          .which flash with pearls and gold embroidery. His
          curiosity aroused, he follows her.

          67

          67 MARKET STALL
          The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market
          stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face.
          It's the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings, her
          beauty is transcendent.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 41
          Abe is thunderstruck.
          As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her
          bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of
          arms!

          ABE
          (into microphone)
          Brother Red!!

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Not now, Abe.
          As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after
          her.

          68

          68 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Hellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a
          surly SHOP OWNER.

          SHOP OWNER
          Never seen anything like it. No one sells
          `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe.
          Behind him, there's a faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and
          gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his
          feet encased in iron shoes.
          Growling, it bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back-

          HELLBOY
          Hiya, Chuck-

           - SAME 69

          69 EXT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES

          Abe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another
          one, narrow and dark. Panhandlers pull at his belt; he bats
          them away.

          70

          70 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Now Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop
          owner.

          JOHANN
          What about this?? Do you recognize this
          seal?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 42
          The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale.

          SHOP OWNER
          You'd better go. Now.

          JOHANN
          Please. We'll make it worth your while.
          The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps
          forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!

          SHOP OWNER (CONT'D)
          He's not friendly-
          Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature.

          HELLBOY
          Well, neither am I-
          BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying
          toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe
          until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the
          dogfight.
          The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing
          with blind instinct.
          Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him
          close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a
          boxer's speed bag as HB "gently" slaps him around. Teeth fly
          everywhere.

          HELLBOY
          Feeling more chatty now??

          SHOP OWNER
          It's rumors! ... just- No- don't hit me,
          all right? There's talk of a revolt- a
          revolt against the human world-
          Hellboy releases him, then looks around.

          HELLBOY
          Where the hell is Abe??
          He pushes his belt locator-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 43
          1.,,,d 71 INT. TROLL MARKET ALLEY MAZE - NIGHT 71
          The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe
          stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates
          to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a
          safety holding case.
          The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands
          him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to
          her. He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and
          hands it to her.
          A red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty-

          ABE
          I'm following a lead, Red. Keep your
          locator -.
          A large TROLL cuts him off-

          ABE
          Excuse me- What do you think you're
          doing?

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Are you in trouble? Talk to me, Abe.
          Another TROLL comes up behind Abe.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          I don't think you-
          The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty
          looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my-
          The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet -
          into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands
          on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He
          groans.

          HELLBOY
          Abe? What's wrong?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 44
          Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot. But his vision
          blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the
          cobblestones.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit -

          72 EXT. SHOP - SAME 72

          The locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann
          look at each other.
          Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the
          crowd.

          73 INT. MAP SHOP - LATER 73

          Abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's
          surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The
          door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt-
          It's not there.

          PRINCESS
          If you are looking for your weapons, my
          guards took them.
          Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet
          away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in
          fine silk robes.
          She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large,
          featherless REPTILE/BIRDS.

          ABE
          I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure
          you...

          PRINCESS
          Why were you following me?
          Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly
          beguiled by her.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Are you seeking to join my brother?

          ABE
          Your brother-??

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 45

          PRINCESS
          In his revolt against the humans?

          ABE
          A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely
          mistaken...
          He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere,
          barking and growling.

          PRINCESS
          Then answer me truthfully- Why were you
          following me?

          ABE
          My name is Abe Sapien -

          PRINCESS

          (LAUGHING)
          There is no such name!

          ABE
          Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I
          beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for
          Paranormal Research and Defense. If we
          can assist you-

          PRINCESS
          Give me your hand.
          Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his
          palm.
          The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for
          the YRDRIG to yield.

          PRINCESS
          Down Yrdrig - he's a friend.
          The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all
          three tongues.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Yrdrig's really just a puppy.
          The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw.

          ABE

          (WHEEZING)
          Nice puppy...

          A
          The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him
          playful shake.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 46

          PRINCESS
          My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave
          our guest alone-
          The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig!
          As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up-

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          (bows her head)
          My name is Princess Nuala.

          ABE
          (bows his head)
          Your highness, the honor is all mine.

          PRINCESS
          May I apologize, Mr. Sapien, for the
          manner in which we brought you here...
          couldn't be too sure.
          She offers him the locator belt.

          ABE
          Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy,

          TOO-

          PRINCESS
          And under diplomatic immunity - may I
          seek asylum??

          ABE
          We would be... honored, I'm sure. But,
          may I ask: from whom do you seek asylum?
          Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door flies off its
          hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile
          fallen guards outside.

          ABE
          Red, no! I'm all right!
          The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm.

          ABE
          Gentlemen! Some respect, please!
          The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards.
          The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz around HB, who swats them like
          mosquitoes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 47

          PRINCESS
          And that was my royal guard.

          ABE
          Red, apologize at once! We are in the
          presence of... royalty!
          Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a
          schoolboy.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          You're vouching for her, I take it. Mr
          Sapien?

          ABE
          Oh, most definitely. She's from an
          ancient, noble line -

          JOHANN
          - of warriors. The Children of the Earth.
          (to the Princess)
          I'm sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a
          fierce bloodline, we cannot take your
          claim of allegiance at face value.
          He produces the ANCIENT SEAL.

          74 INT. MAPMAKERS VESTIBULE - LATER 74

          Standing at a long deal table, the Princess lights a candle
          and examines the ancient seal.

          PRINCESS
          Where did you get this?

          HELLBOY
          Human side, two nights ago-
          The Princess studies their faces.

          PRINCESS
          In ancient times a seal like this was
          delivered to the enemy as a declaration
          of war. A signal from the underground
          realm to the entire world. It prefaced
          the awakening of the Golden Army-
          Johann sits down heavily.

          JOHANN
          I feared as much.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 48

          HELLBOY
          (to Johann)
          What-? What-? A goblin army-?
          Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry.

          JOHANN
          Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There
          has been nothing to substantiate such a

          TALE-

          PRINCESS
          Not a tale- At the dawn of time... Even
          before the great flood, man and the
          Children of the Earth shared this
          planet...
          (she sighs)
          But as man in his greed expanded his
          dominion, there ensued a bitter war...

          DISSOLVE:

          75 EXT. MYTHICAL BATTLEFIELD - DUSK 75

          Silhouetted against a crimson sky, the shadows of thousands
          upon thousands of goblins, elves and fairies do battle with
          hordes of men.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          In those days, my people were led by my
          Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of
          Elfland.
          KING BALOR fights valiantly at the side of his son, the
          tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE NUADA.

          PRINCESS (V. 0.) (CONT'D)
          The bloodshed went on year after year.
          Many lives were lost.
          An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below
          the horizon.

          76 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 76

          Seated in an 'opulent throne room, KING BALOR addresses a
          wretched guild of deformed goblins.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 49

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          It was then that the King ordered the
          Sigri to build him a new, invincible
          army.

          77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77

          Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of
          goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving
          parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted
          onto tall, ornate, golden figures.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          This was an army that would not eat,
          drink or grow tired. A heartless,
          ruthless force made of the purest metal,
          mined from the depths of the earth.

          78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78

          In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line
          up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's
          command.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          The Sigri worked until the winter moon
          was high in the sky -
          The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments
          of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN
          directly over the King's head.

          KING
          I am King Balor, leader of the Golden
          Army. Is there anyone here who disputes
          my right???
          Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin
          crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response-
          TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him.

          79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79

          As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the
          earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles
          with the arms of the approaching troops.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 50

          80 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 80

          The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the
          humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by
          battle axes, bludgeons and lances.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          But this army knew no bounds, had no
          remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in
          blind battle with man, woman or child.
          The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through
          armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise.
          The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine
          devouring tender flesh.
          At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And as the king gazed upon the earth
          awash in blood and at the impassive metal
          faces of the army he had created, his
          heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at
          too high a price. This war should never
          have been waged.
          The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand
          in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
          men would keep to their cities and we
          children of the Earth would dwell within
          the forests. This pact, he declared,
          would be honored by our sons and the sons
          of their sons until the end of time.
          Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          But my brother did not believe in the
          promises of men. He marched off into
          exile, vowing to return if the Sons of
          the Earth ever needed him.
          Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset.

          81

          81 INT. STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under
          the light of ten thousand flickering torches.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 51

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          And the golden army was ordered to lie
          dormant, locked inside the earth itself -
          and there it is to this day, waiting for
          the wearer of the crown to command it
          again.

          82 INT. MAPMAKER'S SHOP - NIGHT 82

          The Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at
          each other.

          HELLBOY
          Where is that crown??

          PRINCESS
          My father had it destroyed. Cut into
          three pieces. One for mankind...
          She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a
          chain around her neck.

          PRINCESS
          .Two for the sons of the Earth.

          ABE
          So, you do need our help..?

          PRINCESS
          I'm afraid it's the other way around.
          She holds the CYLINDER she purchased.

          PRINCESS
          The location of the Golden Army is
          contained within this cylinder--
          She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She
          extends it: the map just shows three coordinates.

          ABE
          Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old
          name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here-

          PRINCESS
          But nothing else-
          She rolls back the map into the cylinder.

          PRINCESS
          So far, this is a family matter. To
          intervene will bring nothing but trouble.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 52

          HELLBOY
          Good, I like trouble.

          83 INT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES - NIGHT 83

          The Princess leads the group through the surging, noisy
          crowd of bizarre creatures. Hellboy, Johann and Abe bring up
          the rear.

          PRINCESS
          No- not that way. Too risky-
          They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-

          JOHANN
          (finally, pointing)
          There. Stairs to the street...

          BUT-

          PRINCE
          Hold!
          The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in
          black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the
          rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:

          PRINCE
          Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can
          you recognize a traitor? She's here to
          betray her own!
          He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.

          PRINCE
          I'm here to recruit all of you against
          the humans. Make your decision now. Those
          who join me will be rewarded. The rest...
          will be killed.
          A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of
          CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
          unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.
          He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap
          down to block his path.

          HELLBOY
          I'm gonna put this as delicately as I
          can.

          CUT TO:

          84

          84 INT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAME

          A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players
          in colorful shirts and shoes.
          Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds
          right at the pins...

          BOWLER
          Look out, Manny! Strike city..!
          CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting
          the clawing monsters right behind him!
          As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out
          into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way
          free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.
          Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the
          water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries
          the blows, leaping like Nureyev.
          Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at
          the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their
          feet.
          As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as
          clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors.

          85

          85 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

          Outside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come
          is back. He
          running. As their lights blaze up, REPORTER 2
          gapes in disgust:
          Hellboy's massive hands are wrapped around the neck of a
          sweet little OLD LADY! He beats her mercilessly!

          OLD LADY
          Help me...! Please, somebody..!

          REPORTER 2
          (to his cameraman)
          Oh, my God!! Oh, my- Roll! Roll on this!

          BELLBOY
          It's not what you think -!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 54

          REPORTER
          (pointing at HB)
          He's lost his mind! He's worse than any
          of them..!
          CUT BACK to Hellboy, revealing that the old lady is actually

          WINK.
          Liz runs over with a prism from the SCHUFFTEIN GOGGLES and
          sticks it in front of the camera lens, revealing the truth.
          The reporter checks his monitor.

          REPORTER

          OH-

          86 STREET FIGHT 86
          ALL the BPRD team, including Liz, is swept up in this fight.
          The denizens of the troll market overturn parked cars and
          knock down lamp posts, ROARING with excitement.

          LIZ

          (MUTTERING)
          The fire is not my enemy-- it is a part
          of me--
          Liz yells out a warning... and then throws a barrage of
          flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn.
          Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his
          legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT -
          he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature!
          WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally
          vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing
          it away.
          As the other monsters retreat...
          .the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical
          GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over
          to the BPRD truck.
          The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse,
          screaming, renewing the panic.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          I will find you, young daemon -
          (to Nuala)
          - and you, too, my sister. Meanwhile,
          here's a taste of what lies in store.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 55
          He throws the grenade. Hellboy dives, just in time to catch
          it. He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to
          its clockwork innards then: PING!!!!

          HELLBOY
          It's a dud, your royal assness - !
          The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.

          HELLBOY
          How do you like that? Just when I was
          loosening up.
          Then... CLACKK!!!.
          Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a
          beans.
          flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly colored

          ABE
          Pick them up!!

          HELLBOY
          Abe. relax- It's jumping beans...
          Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.

          ABE
          Do as I say!
          With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few.

          ABE
          How many do you have?

          HELLBOY
          Three, how about you?

          ABE
          Three! There's always seven! Find the
          last one!!!

          TO
          The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer
          edge...

          ABE
          Quick, it's going for water!
          Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops
          into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my God, evacuate the area!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 56

          HELLBOY
          Abe, please, get a grip.
          A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM!
          A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning
          cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping
          up through the Bridge overpass!!
          Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into
          the moonlit clouds.
          Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in
          fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and
          flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment
          Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Whoa. Just like the story books.
          Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING
          climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT
          HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her "ala" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd
          starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.

          LIZ
          This is so beautiful-

          MANNING
          So- perfect- so peaceful-

          HELLBOY
          Hey!!!
          He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it-

          HELLBOY
          Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh-
          Jeez did you have to do that??
          Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd-

          LIZ
          Back- Go back- right now!!!

          MANNING
          What? What? What is he doing-?

          LIZ
          He's knocking on wood- summoning an

          ELEMENTAL-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 57

          MANNING
          An elem-

          LIZ
          A forest spirit that lives in that tree.
          He's releasing it-

          MANNING
          Oh, and is it that bad??
          KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under
          some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even
          the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape
          descends.
          BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant

          ELEMENTAL.
          Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out
          of the tree and stares at Hellboy.
          Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm
          and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
          WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
          turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
          back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
          single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.

          HELLBOY
          Good dog.
          (to Elemental)
          Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,
          you fight with me.
          Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.
          The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his
          limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.

          ABE
          (to the Princess)
          This may not be the best place for you,
          your majesty. With your permission...
          He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe
          to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the
          ground where they had been standing!
          Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and
          branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to
          the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord.
          Johann sees this-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 58

          JOHANN
          I have a plan-
          He looks at Abe-

          87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87
          -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the
          BPRD garbage truck.
          Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.

          88 ABANDONED BUILDING

          88
          Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches
          extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his
          feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the
          Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
          and discarding branches and roots.

          89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89

          Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
          Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
          through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a
          corridor littered with debris.
          Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section
          of the corridor as Hellboy runs.

          90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90

          Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of
          reach of the Elemental.

          HELLBOY
          (to the Elemental)
          What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?
          The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,
          barking in frustration.
          Hellboy's RADIO crackles:

          ABE
          (on the radio)
          HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 59

          HELLBOY
          So what?

          JOHANN
          So, lead him to the bridge.
          Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn
          Bridge in the distance.

          HELLBOY
          That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!

          ABE
          You'll figure it out.

          HELLBOY
          What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
          Hello???
          No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
          neon sign reading "Hotel".
          The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
          the "0" to the roof.

          91 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME 91

          Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
          Johann is sitting next to her.

          92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92

          Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
          sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
          and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
          Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
          roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
          pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
          Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
          Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
          the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.

          93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93

          Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using
          binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy
          bringing the Elemental closer.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 60

          ABE
          Johann - they're almost here.
          Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops
          at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.
          Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.

          ABE
          Yes. I had the very same idea...
          He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine
          which holds a half mile of steel cable.

          ABE
          (gazing at the controls)
          .but how do you operate this??

          JOHANN
          If you'll permit me...
          Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
          the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          Stand back, Abe.
          A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
          the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
          near the far shore of the East River.

          JOHANN
          Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the
          other side.
          (seeing Hellboy coming)
          Quickly, Abe!

          94 IN THE WATER 94
          Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.
          Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan
          shore.

          95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95
          Hellboy makes it to the bridge... as, behind him, the
          Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and
          barges.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 61

          96

          96 IN THE RIVER
          Abe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable,
          towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (on the radio)
          Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!
          The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on

          IT-

          ABE
          I need more!

          JOHANN
          No more available!
          The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
          he encounters the submerged cable.

          97

          97 UNDERWATER
          Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
          past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting
          CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!
          Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
          unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.

          98

          98 AT THE BRIDGE
          As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone
          calling out from above:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
          who were so eager for a fight?
          The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
          Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.

          PRINCE
          (to the Elemental)
          Over here, dear friend...
          SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy
          wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 62
          The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel
          spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.

          PRINCE
          This might be a good chance for you to
          come to your senses. Help us.

          HELLBOY
          I've been all through this! The answer's
          still no!
          Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
          bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
          steel snake!
          The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
          Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable

          TENSES-

          JOHANN
          (to Liz)
          Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
          He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
          concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
          of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
          Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
          river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
          tosses Hellboy high into the air.
          On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
          back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
          Elemental's back, right behind his head.

          HELLBOY
          Nap time, Big guy-
          He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
          of the neck.
          The cable tenses-
          -The Elemental pitches forward-
          The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
          him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
          The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
          the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
          Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 63
          The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace
          the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks
          of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
          leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
          Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
          bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,
          laughing and happy to be together.
          Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at
          him...
          Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance,
          jealous, alone.

          CUT TO:

          99 INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER 99

          BLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan
          again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a
          button, brings the paper close for inspection.
          Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye.
          Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans
          over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke.

          JOHANN
          You'll permit a small criticism? You take
          too much time to aim, to think. Nein.
          Just point- like afinger- as if you wish
          for something.

          HELLBOY
          Oh, I wish for something.
          Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster
          of shots, dead center.

          JOHANN
          Speed is of the essence. You must work on
          it. I'm willing to spend some -
          Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's
          onto the floor.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I
          don't like it.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 64

          JOHANN
          On the contrary.

          100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100

          Hellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where
          Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a
          terry cloth towel.

          HELLBOY
          You keep wiping that thing like she's
          gonna care.

          JOHANN
          She- Who-??

          HELLBOY
          You know who- She-

          (BEAT)
          She's not gonna care.

          JOHANN
          (long beat)
          You think I'm after Liz, don't you?
          (Hellboy walks out)
          Well, I'm not.

          HELLBOY
          Why not?

          (BEAT)
          Not good enough for you?
          Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind
          Johann.

          HELLBOY
          Well- From now on, you don't come near
          her. You don't talk to her-

          JOHANN
          You forget. I'm part of the team now,
          such interactions are inev-

          HELLBOY
          Well- you better start making them
          "evitable"-

          JOHANN
          That's not a word-

          HELLBOY
          Yes, it is-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 65

          JOHANN
          No, it isn't-
          Hellboy raises his stone fist.

          HELLBOY
          Now it is-

          JOHANN
          Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That's
          how you win an argument.

          HELLBOY
          I try.

          JOHANN
          Well, you're big, I'll give you that much-

          HELLBOY
          "Give me???"- You don't give me sh-

          JOHANN
          -and you're strong- but you're slow.

          HELLBOY
          Slo-??

          JOHANN
          Very- slow- I've seen your fighting
          style. Very slow-
          WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive
          fist. To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium
          shatters!

          HELLBOY
          Slow enough for ya-??
          With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor!

          HELLBOY
          Ow- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got
          carried away...
          (leaning over the empty suit)
          Johann? You still hear me?
          An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and
          penetrates the closest locker.

          HELLBOY
          It was an accident, okay? I'll get you
          some help-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 66
          With a CLANG! -- the bank of lockers comes to life! Metal
          doors smack Hellboy's head repeatedly, like a pinball
          machine! his face imprinted in the metal.

          JOHANN
          See? Speed is the key.
          The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers
          and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he
          goes by.
          Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits.

          HELLBOY
          Chicken shit!

          - NIGHT 101

          101 INT. THE LIBRARY

          Abe floats in his tank, smiling at the Princess, who's at
          one of the book stands, reading to him.

          PRINCESS
          "I sometimes have a queer feeling -
          especially when you are near me, as
          now: it is as if I had a string somewhere
          under my left ribs, tightly and
          inextricably knotted to a similar string
          situated in the corresponding quarter of
          your little frame."

          ABE
          I love this part. Keep going.

          PRINCESS
          "I am afraid that cord of communion will
          be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion
          I should take to bleeding inwardly."
          She closes the book, looking troubled.

          ABE
          Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I
          was born. It would have been a great
          privilege to have known her...

          PRINCESS
          This "Jane Eyre"... I understand it's
          only a story, but such a tie that binds,
          it exists between me and my brother. I
          assure you: my brother, he's not dead-

          How can you know? We all saw-

          PRINCESS
          We are twins. Even now, I can sense his
          presence. This has been our way since we
          were young children, in Renvyle-

          A magical place in the West. A different
          time. Long gone. Now, he's near and he's
          looking for me. I can feel and even
          understand his. hatred for mankind.

          ABE
          Men... usually mean well, I believe that.
          But they need our help and patience.

          PRINCESS
          You were very brave, vouching for me. How
          do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing
          me here?

          ABE
          It's as you were saying, I suppose. From
          intuition, feeling. I've never met anyone
          like you... but that's my instinct.
          They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles
          swirl out of Abe's gills.

          Liz is patching Hellboy's injured head. In the background
          the TV's are playing up: CITY LIGHTS, WHITE HEAT and some TV
          programming.

          HELLBOY
          He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him
          next time.
          He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc.

          LIZ
          There shouldn't be a "next time" we're
          all part of the same team.

          We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac.
          You can see right through him.

          (PAUSE)
          That's a joke, Liz.
          Liz remains silent.

          HELLBOY
          (raises a letter)
          Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series,
          based on me? And this:
          (he holds up a box of cereal)
          Product endorsement - breakfast of
          demons. And a videogame!!!
          As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume
          up.

          LIZ
          Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It
          always gets me- Red- There's something I
          need to-

          (taking the remote)
          No, wait.
          (switching to Leno)
          Look that's us-
          Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident.

          LENO
          So- this "Hellboy" what is he?? Is he
          really on our side?? I mean, he's red,
          has a tail and shaves his horns- horns,
          Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a
          good sign.

          Ha- He's funny.

          You're really liking this, aren't you?

          HELLBOY
          We should do this-

          LIZ
          It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really
          need everybody to like you?? What's in it
          for you?? Are we not enough???
          She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted
          in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball
          balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles.

          HELLBOY
          That's funny.

          CUT TO:

          103 EXT. BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 103

          Liz is looking out into Trenton NJ's light landscape. Johann
          approaches her.

          JOHANN
          Are you alright-?
          Liz nods weakly.

          JOHANN
          May I be of assistance??

          LIZ
          Maybe.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 70

          JOHANN
          He's a big brute, isn't he??
          Liz chuckles.

          JOHANN
          But he has a good heart. I know it. He
          means well.

          LIZ
          I think I may have made a mistake.

          JOHANN
          In what way, Mein Frau??

          LIZ
          Just a mistake- nothing important.

          (SIGHS)
          But sometimes being with him is not easy-

          JOHANN
          It never is. I know.
          Lis looks at him with renewed interest.

          JOHANN
          I was married once. A long, long time
          ago... And only after I lost her- I
          realized that my life would never be
          quite the same- And my loss lead me to
          become what I am today...
          Johann's human face materializes inside his glass helmet.

          JOHANN
          I- I tried constantly to make contact
          with her-

          DISSOLVE STARTS :

           - SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 104

          104 FLASHBACK - CIRCA 2001
          Johann's mouth opens and out of it emerges a large tendril
          of ectoplasm. His neck engorges and the substance continues
          to flow freely out of his mouth and fingertips--

          JOHANN
          It was only there- in the Ethereal plane
          that I ever gazed upon her again...
          CAMERA close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the
          room. Their flame illuminating the eerie scene.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 71
          Out of the mouths of the other guests, emerge other, equally
          large ectoplasmic shapes.
          They cross to-

          105 THE ETHEREAL PLANE 105
          Once there- they reform into humanoid shapes, vaguely
          reminiscent of their mortal bodies.
          JOHANN floats freely, approaching another humanoid form in
          the void: That of a woman, his wife.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          But it was there, while he was partially
          on the ethereal plane, that disaster

          STRUCK-
          He is about to embrace his wife's form when a horrible
          rumble occurs and the void bursts in flames, destroying and
          distorting everything around him-
          His wife's shape screams and evaporates.

          106 INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 106

          BPRD agents break in on the scene. Smoke and flames billow
          in the room, wax puddles stand where the CEREMONIAL CANDLES
          were and seated around the seance table, charred corpses
          hold hands in eternal contact. As the Agents move around a
          pale, vaporous shape emerges from the soot-stained darkness:
          It's Johann.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          All the seance attendees were
          incinerated. The only survivor -and only
          to some extent- was me- Why? I'll never

          KNOW--
          The form moves towards its body and attempts to climb back
          and reanimate it, but the CHARRED CORPSE is barely amble to
          amble a few steps forward before collapsing into ash and
          bone... The shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost-
          Then, Professor TREVOR BROOM wanders into the scene and
          approaches the form-

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          It was then that Professor Broom and the
          B.P.R.D. devised a containment suit for
          me. A new body-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 72
          CAMERA pulls back to reveal-

          107 BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 107
          Johann, back in the balcony, talking to Liz.

          JOHANN
          I owe Professor Broom everything that
          I've become. He brought me back to life-
          He grows silent for a brief moment.

          JOHANN
          But I've never been able to see her
          again. My reach became limited- My loss,
          infinite...
          Liz puts her hand on his shoulder. Johann takes it...

          JOHANN
          Loss- the very threat of it makes us
          vulnerable... makes us care- You can see
          that, don't you?? Without her I became
          but an empty shell...
          Liz leans her head on his shoulder.

          JOHANN
          Don't give up on him. Not yet.
          Liz chuckles.

          LIZ
          No. Not yet.
          CAMERA discovers HELLBOY, watching them from behind a glass
          door, a six-pack in his hand. He steps away.

          108 INT. CORRIDOR - LATER 108

          Heliboy walks down a deserted corridor carrying his six
          pack.
          He stops, puzzled. Strains of Barry Manilow are emanating
          from the library.

          109 INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 109

          Hellboy enters the library and goes over to the tank. Abe is
          there, listening to Vivaldi.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 73

          ABE
          Ah, hello Red. You're up late.

          HELLBOY
          Liz and I- we had a fight-

          ABE

          OH-
          Hellboy eyes the CD player.

          HELLBOY
          Did I hear Barry Manilow just now?

          ABE
          (smiles hypocritical)
          Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no-
          (fast, stammering)
          It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento
          dell'armonia I believe I particularly
          admire the passage...
          Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music
          stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer.

          HELLBOY
          What's happening to you??

          ABE
          Ooh- Ooh-

          (SIGHS)
          All my life I thought I was alone, a made-
          up name and a random pasted on a
          cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like
          me. A creature from another world...
          Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in
          love.

          HELLBOY
          You say that like it's a good thing.
          (looks at the CD)
          What track?

          ABE

          (ASHAMED)
          Track eight-

          HELLBOY

          (READS)
          Oh, God- you're disgusting-

          ABE
          I know-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 74

          HELLBOY
          "Can't smile without you"

          ABE
          I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for
          it..

          (DESPERATE)
          What am I going to do, Red????
          Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs
          heavily, looks around-

          ABE
          I miss him- Father- don't you??

          HELLBOY

          (NODS)
          Everyday.

          ABE
          He would tell what to do- He would tell
          what's right- what's wrong-

          HELLBOY
          He did that for all of us...
          The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You."

          ABE
          (sips beer)
          You know? I- I never much appreciated
          Manilow's artistry that much- until now-
          Now it seems to be a grand poet and
          speaks directly to my innermost feelings.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- You need to get out more-
          The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the
          syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing:
          low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and
          teary-eyed.

          110 INT. PRINCESS ROOM AT BPRD - NIGHT

          The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then
          feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the
          panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the
          distant city lights below...

          EXT. BPRD - NIGHT 111

          The music can be heard at a distance.
          A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening
          and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the
          building.

          112 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - DAY

          Manning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD
          team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS.

          MANNING
          This is a whole new ballgame and I want
          you to take my lead.

          ABE
          I find these leather outfits very

          UNCOMFORTABLE-

          MANNING
          Maybe so, maybe so- but they look- hip.

          (BEAT)
          When it comes to dealing with reporters
          or the public, I set the tone. You all
          know the old saying: the perception is
          the reality.

          HELLBOY
          Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we
          can ditch the garbage truck, right?

          ABE
          Wait, Red, the lab's in it-

          HELLBOY
          Screw the lab. I want new wheels.

          MANNING

          (SMIRKING)
          You got 'em-
          The round a corner and enter -

          113 INT. BPRD GARAGE - DAY 113

          Three gleaming Hummers await them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 76

          MANNING
          A gift from General Motors. One for each
          of you.
          Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy's with scenes of
          Dante's inferno, Liz's with flames and Abe's with an
          underwater vista.

          HELLBOY
          This is more like it!

          LIZ
          I'm not driving that-
          Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer.

          ABE
          This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The
          sheer waste of precious fossil fuels...

          MANNING
          An American custom, it's called product
          placement! What's the harm?

          CUT TO:

          -- DAY 114

          114 EXT. NEW YORK STREET

          A mob of SCREAMING FANS outside the TV studio. The frenzy
          intensifies when they see the Hummers pulling up.
          As the BPRD team exits the cars, autograph seekers break
          through the POLICE LINE and swarm around the heroes.

          MANNING
          Every agent on the field is on the case.
          They will solve it--
          Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish.

          HELLBOY
          There you go, pal. "To Jason, best
          wishes, Hellboy."

          FAN
          (squints at the signature)
          How am I supposed to read that?

          You don't like it?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 77
          Irritated, he scowls at the fan. Manning takes him by the
          elbow and leads him away.

          HELLBOY
          (to the fan)
          That turns up on e-Bay, I'm gonna find
          you, "Jason"...

          115 INT. GREEN ROOM - LATER

          A row of makeup chairs. Manning sits in the first one,
          looking at himself in the mirror.

          MANNING
          Can you do anything about this... uh...
          (lowers his voice)
          -double chin?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          No, you're not being made up.

          MANNING
          Why not?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          They said, you're too normal. You don't
          need anything.

          MANNING
          But- Believe me- I'm not normal at
          all...

          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where Makeup Girl
          holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at Abe.

          MAKEUP GIRL 2
          So, what color is that- green?

          ABE
          Carribbean Blue, actually.
          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy
          Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest.

          MAKEUP GIRL 3
          Are these really scars?

          HELLBOY
          Well, yeah. Each one tells a story-
          His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly
          gets up and goes to them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 78

          HELLBOY
          That about you, glass-man? A few squirts
          of Windex?

          JOHANN
          I'm not going on. And if I may- a word of

          ADVICE-
          (long beat, then sotto voce)
          -it's not a good idea to hint that you
          two have... a relationship.

          HELLBOY
          Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that.

          JOHANN
          You don't know how people may react.

          HELLBOY
          It's a love story. They'll lap it up.

          JOHANN
          I know you don't like me, but trust me on
          this one.

          (BEAT)
          I knew your father- he was a friend-
          Hellboy blinks, taking the information in.

          JOHANN
          Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't
          have approved of your behaviour.
          A P.A. opens the door.

          P.A.
          You're on-!

          JOHANN
          I'll be watching from the truck lab,
          where I belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen
          minutes...

          In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train ROAR!!!
          The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves
          to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers. The
          lights grow in intensity and the ROAR becomes deafening. But

          Why are you just "Liz" and not Fire Girl?

          LIZ
          I was born in Milwaukee, so it was just
          plain old Liz ever since first grade.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, we do call her Sparky now and then.
          A chuckle from the crowd. Hellboy smiles in satisfaction.

          And you, Abe. Is it uncomfortable at
          night with that toilet seat around your
          neck?
          The Princess smiles as the camera singles out Abe for a
          closeup.

          ABE
          Actually, Mr. Leno, my lungs are more
          like gills. I need to convert the air's
          nitrogen into oxygen, otherwise I'd
          suffocate in five minutes.

          The Princess snaps off the TV, looking worried.
          Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold piece
          hanging from a chain around her neck. She closes her eyes
          and shudders - trouble is near.
          The Yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers.

          At that moment, the Yrdrig GROWLS -

          PRINCESS
          Shhh, it's all right -
          BOOM-! A jolt shakes the room. A-moment later, a wall
          collapses as warty, heavily muscled ARMS and FINGERS tear at
          the masonry!
          in seconds, a squad of TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK
          leers at the Princess. From her waistband, she produces a
          long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly.
          Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging.
          The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs.
          With a SNARL, it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest
          trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral
          staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice:

          PRINCE
          Hold.
          The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear.
          The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him.

          PRINCE
          Come-!
          The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince.
          The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and
          brutally twists -!

           ALARMS are ringing as the Hummers pull into the underground

          Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing
          into the building. The alarm bells are deafening.

          128 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR 128

          Hellboy leads the way down the corridors, which are alive
          with scrambling personnel. Several BPRD employees are lying
          on the floor, wounded and confused.

          129 INT. LOBBY 129

          The top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their
          guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his
          drooling bodyguards. Standoff.
          As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her
          arms tied. Her brother holds her by the hair.

          ABE
          Princess!
          Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the
          trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest-

          HELLBOY
          Abe! No, get back!!
          Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to
          the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy
          manages to restrain him.

          PRINCESS
          Mr. Sapien, don't! He'll kill you!

          PRINCE
          I'll kill you all, if that's what you
          want.

          HELLBOY
          No. Why don't you just start with me?
          Hellboy strolls up to the Prince.

          You challenge-me?

          Five-fingered Mary.
          In the background, Manning arrives, wide-eyed. Just in time
          to see the Prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls.
          He drops back, flips his spear to horizontal and waits for
          Hellboy's attack.

          130

          130 FIGHT
          Hellboy feints left, goes right and whips around, swinging
          his tail at the Prince. The Prince leaps and jabs with the
          spear, poking a hole in Hellboy's coat.
          The surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle
          each other. The Prince is nimble. The Prince is quick. He
          thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy into a
          display case full of antique weapons.
          The glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the
          floor.

          JOHANN
          (to Hellboy)
          Arm yourself! Use the flail!.

          HELLBOY
          Not my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl.
          He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to
          his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal
          combination.
          In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back
          and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her
          lips.

          ABE
          (seeing this)
          H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him!
          As the Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe,
          momentarily distracted- Then-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 87
          Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the Prince's SPEAR TIP is
          half-buried in his chest...!
          The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank,
          breaking off the blade! Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz
          SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he
          collapses.
          The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans.
          His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side.

          PRINCE
          (showing off the Princess)
          If you want to see her again, you'll give
          me what's rightfully mine. Many people
          died for that crown. Bring it to me.
          He and his trolls escape into the night.

          In CLOSE-UP, Abe's webbed fingers lightly touch the glinting
          metal that protrudes from Hellboy's sternum. The spear tip
          responds, as if alive; it wriggles, producing a GROAN from

          HB.
          Liz is near panic.

          Abe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins

          He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in
          pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane
          Eyre."
          He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece.

          LIZ
          Any luck?
          Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious
          thing in his webbed hand.

          Abe looks supremely troubled.

          LIZ
          Abe, let's do this for Red!
          Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck

          and coordinates become visible.

          Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her
          brother were born there. They hold it
          sacred.

          Even if you're right, we sit tight and
          locate the gold piece, make sure he never

          Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks at him, teary-eyed.

          ABE
          We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You
          are right, Liz- We should just do this
          together: the three of us.
          Liz smiles.

          CUT TO:

          138 INT. PLANE - NIGHT 138

          The BPRD airplane sits quietly in its hangar. In the
          passenger compartment, Hellboy climbs up. He looks up to see
          Liz smiling down at him.

          139 INT. COCKPIT - SAME 139

          Abe's sitting in the pilot's seat, leafing through the
          massive airplane manual.

          ABE
          Engine, starting- refer to NA-7488-BD...
          Liz climbs in behind him.

          LIZ
          We stay here much longer, we're gonna get
          caught...

          ABE
          Just a few more minutes. Here's an easy
          way to remember that "port" means "left."
          They each have four-
          A NOISE from the door: it's Johann.

          JOHANN
          Good evening, friends.

          LIZ
          Don't try to stop us, Johann.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 92

          JOHANN
          On the contrary. I've been giving it some
          thought, and we should be able to save
          Hellboy. After all, the Prince lacks the
          gold crown. Without it, his army poses no
          threat. None at all.
          Abe is very quiet.

          ABE
          (in despair)
          Its useless- I- I- can't- I can't pilot
          this thing...
          Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the
          controls...

          JOHANN
          I'll give it a try-
           Abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up.

           140

          140 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - SAME

          Manning bangs on a vending machine in one of the BPRD
          corridors. As a dribble of hot coffee splatters into his
          cup, a couple of AGENTS run up.

          AGENT
          Sir - you'd better come, fast -

          MANNING
          Got it - ow!
          He burns his fingers on the coffee as he hurries after the
          agents.

          141

          141 INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER

          The BPRD airplane is ROARING, amid clouds of exhaust fumes.
          The plane spins around and around in tight circles, its wing
          tips knocking into ladders, lights and shelves.
          A bunch of agents are cowering in the doorway as Manning
          arrives.

          MANNING
          Not ALL of them, it's not possible!

          AGENT
          Isn't that Johann at the controls?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 93
          Sure enough, they get a glimpse of the transparent head
          through the cockpit window. Abe's there, too. He raises a
          webbed hand to wave goodbye.
          The plane taxis outside onto the runway...

          142 EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT 142

          .and takes off, barely under control, just missing the New
          Jersey treetops.

          CUT TO:

          143 UNDERGROUND 143
          The Prince pulls the Princess through fractured, roaring
          tunnels. Here and there, the walls are pierced, allowing
          light and ocean waves to enter.
          Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall
          decorated with a large, elaborate FRESCO. It shows a
          stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive renderings of
          trolls, faeries and ogres.

          PRINCE
          Maybe this will help you remember who we
          are, who you are... What our destiny is-
          The Prince pushes his sister through a low doorway, out onto

          A-

          144 LEDGE 144
          -overlooking a vast cavern, big as a stadium, lit by a
          thousand torches. The mechanical ARMY stands knee-deep in
          heaving seawater and foam.

          PRINCE
          They - they - will be mine to command,
          whether you like it or not. Only after
          our victory will you appreciate my
          sacrifice... and yours.

          145 EXT. BPRD PLANE - DAY 145

          The BPRD plane exits a bank of clouds and starts its descent
          upon an Irish island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 94
          Massive granite mountains encircle an impossibly green
          valley.

          146 TNT. BPRD PLANE COCKPIT - DAY 146
          Early sunlight washes over Hellboy's body, who weakly groans
          in Liz's arms.

          HELLBOY
          (to Liz)
          Where are we, Liz..?

          LIZ
          Near the ocean, Red.We'regonna make you
          well here.

          147 EXT.OPEN FIELD,IRELAND - DAY 147


          148 SIGN:REYNVILLE,IRELAND. 148
          The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and

          JOHANN-

          149 EXT. GREEN FIELD - DAY 149

          Liz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled TREE, twisted by
          eons of wind.
          Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar,
          weird tree.

          ABE
          This should be the portal. By all rights-
          Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.

          JOHANN
          Abe, bring the mapcase over here.
          He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest
          branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its
          crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a
          perfect fit.

          LIZ
          Yes! Try it, Abe-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 95

          JOHANN
          Before you do anything... remember what
          we're in for. A world unlike anything
          we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive...

          LIZ
          You're wasting time!
          Abe inserts and twists the cylinder.
          The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground,
          bending them into a swaying arch.

          JOHANN
          Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to
          leave.
           They walk under the tree roots, into...

           150

          150 FAIRY WORLD
          A transformed landscape. A perpetual nightland- Still
          overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale
          colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours.
          The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a
          rugged coastline.

          CUT TO:

          151 EXT. INLET - DAY 151

          The team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet. Abe
          brings out the map.

          ABE
          (pointing to the opposite shore)
          Renvyle is over there.
          They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat.
          Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air.
          A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the
          shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting
          atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.

          GOBLIN
          I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you
          be seeking safe passage to Renvyle?

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 96

          LIZ
          Yes! Can you help us?

          JOHANN

          (QUIET)
          Careful, Liz.

          SATYR
          I'm sure you can come to an
          understanding!
          The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the
          rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little
          coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns.

          GOBLIN
          Room enough for all of you!
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Even your weary friend.

          JOHANN
          What will it cost, boatman?
          The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of
          triangular teeth.

          GOBLIN
          Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer.
          Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves:

          LIZ
          How much?

          CROW
          He won't want money.

          JOHANN
          (to the goblin)
          I have a... belt!

          OF
          Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front
          the creature's bat-like face.

          GOBLIN
          I have no use for such a thing.
          Liz shows him her binoculars.

          LIZ
          Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic
          eyes that will bring the world-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 97

          GOBLIN
          I already have binoculars! No, I see
          something special.
          He points toward Hellboy's chest.

          SATYR
          Under his bandage - !
          Quick as a squirrel, the creature hops to Hellboy's side and
          brings out a KNIFE! SWISH! In one sweep of the blade, he
          reveals HB's terrible wound, and the speartip protruding
          from it.

          GOBLIN
          That!
          (points at the steel)
          That - in exchange for your crossing!

          LIZ
          Don't you touch it - !
          She rushes to Hellboy's side, pushing the Goblin back, ready
          for a fight. The Goblin shrugs.

          GOBLIN
          Is it so precious to you? Let me pull it
          out.

          ABE
          You mustn't. One touch can kill him.
          The Goblin's eyes grow wide with understanding.

          GOBLIN
          Ah. I see. We must go to the Angel of

          DEATH-

          CROW
          He'll know what to do.

          152 EXT. INLET - DAY 152

          The tiny boat is a dot on the golden waves of the inlet as
          the Goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a
          cove.
          The Goblin leads the way as Liz, Abe and Johann arrive and
          help Hellboy up.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 98
          Strange BIRDS hang upside down form the Cave's roof. A
          MASSIVE CHIMNEY has been carved out of the cave's rock at
          the other end. A Black, ancient figure is hunched there,
          warming its skeletal hands by the fire.
          A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
          Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
          floor.
          In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the
          crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR
          BLACK WINGS and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale,
          eyeless face.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          So. This one... The boy- I remember him
          well! Anung-un-Rama!

          LIZ
          Oh, my God. She knows - ?!

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          I helped bring him into this world - in
          my fashion.
          It pulls a set of a glowing, red-hot TONGS out of the fire.
          It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in
          Hellboy's flesh.

          ANGEL OF DEATH (CONT'D)
          I warn you: it is his destiny to rule
          over the destruction of the Earth. Not
          now, not tomorrow - but some day. You are
          sure you want him to live?

          LIZ
          Yes, I say yes-!
          Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Very well, then- but let it be said: The
          day will come when you will pay the price
          fire girl: This will bring you and the
          world much sorrow.

          LIZ
          And I'll deal with it when that time
          comes. Now save him.
          The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
          tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody
          point from his chest.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 99
          The ANGEL OF DEATH holds up the speartip and looks at it
          with distaste.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Harmless now.
          (looking at Hellboy)
          See - ?
          Hellboy's eyes flutter open.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          (to Hellboy)
          Sleep now, child. Your strength, it will
          return.
          A guttural HISS from the corner: the Goblin is jumping up
          and down, pointing at the speartip.

          JOHANN
          Our ferry captain - he wants his
          payment...

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Ach, outside with you!
          She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up
          and bounds out the door.
          instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around
          him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize.
          She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on
          her. He smiles wanly.

          CUT TO:

          153 EXT.. HILLTOP - DAY 153

          Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline. Through the
          binoculars, he discerns a SECOND CAVE half-hidden behind
          wild, breaking waves.
          Glancing back at ANGEL OF DEATH's cave, Johann strikes off
          on his own, headed for the cave.

          154 EXT. HUT - DAY 154

          Outside ANGEL OF DEATH's hut, a bandaged HB is sitting up,
          blinking in the sunlight. He sips some tea and gazes at Liz,
          who is happy now.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 100

          LIZ
          I almost lost you-
          Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand-

          HELLBOY
          I thought you were mad at me.

          LIZ
          Well, no one can stay mad forever.

          HELLBOY
          I'm sorry for all the attention, I
          thought it would be good for us.

          LIZ
          We're never going to make them all happy,
          Red. What we have is ours and no one

          ELSE'S-

          BELLBOY
          I can turn my back on the world. I don't
          care anymore I don't- as long as you stay
          with me- as long as you think I'm still a
          good man.

          (BEAT )
          Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I??

          LIZ
          Yes you are. You are the best man I've
          ever met.

          HELLBOY
          You still seem sad. Is there anything you
          want to tell me-??

          LIZ
          Yes, there is-

          HELLBOY
          Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm
          ready.

          (SIGHS)
          Is it about Johann-

          LIZ
          No- no- what are you talking about??
          Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice
          and fresh rags.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 101

          JOHANN
          Abe and I have found the entrance to the
          Golden Army's resting place- Liz come
          with us-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          You should stay behind and get some rest-

          HELLBOY
          And call you in the morning, right?? Like
          Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you,

          GLASSHOLE-

          CUT TO:

          155

          155 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff
          high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to
          the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there,

          WAVING-

          JOHANN
          There.
          Abe points at the violent sea below-

          ABE
          The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to
          jump in-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Can you make it-?
          Hellboy nods.

          BELLBOY
          Strange. If this is the entrance-

          ABE
          I know- Why isn't there more security??
          With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around
          Bellboy's neck!
          The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles
          around Hellboy's neck.
          The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE
          destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects
          twice with Hellboy's head.
          But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in
          two and twirling the mace like a boleador.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 102
          He hits Wink again and again-

          HELLBOY
          See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!!
          Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then,
          like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty
          GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged
          rocks once- twice- thrice-

          HELLBOY
          Ouch- ouch- ouch-
          (looking around)
          We better go swimming before any more
          ugly fellas show up-
          He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes
          his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has
          re-opened.

          ABE
          Red, are you-?

          HELLBOY
          Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on-

          156

          156 UNDERWATER
          Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by
          the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the
          water, too.
          Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the
          cave entrance.

          157 INT. CAVE ENTRANCE - SAME 157

          As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches
          of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz
          starts coughing.

          JOHANN
          Hang on, people. I'll be right back.

          158

          158 UNDERWATER
          Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet
          under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but
          can't make it budge.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 103
          Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in
          his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally
          manages to turn it.
          His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up,
          emitting a plume of blood.
          Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays
          behind and swings open the lock, revealing...

          159 A STAIRWELL 159
          .carved from the living rock, leading upward into the
          depths of the cliff.

          CUT TO:

          160 STAIRS - LATER 160
          The trio cautiously climbs the stairs, finding their way
          with light sticks. Hellboy stops to lean against the wall.
          He dabs at his chest with a rag.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          Hold up. We need to rest.

          HELLBOY
          Says who? I'm fine, I tell ya.
          He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off
          his pain.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          This was a mistake. He's -

          JOHANN
          Mein Gott--
          The stairs lead to-

          161 INT. CAVERN 161

          -a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are
          flickering.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal rank upon rank of GOLDEN
          SOLDIERS. Immobile. Silent. Waiting.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 104

          162 AMONG THE SOLDIERS 162
          Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues,
          pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
          infantrymen.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, amigo. You got some gum?
          Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
          terminates the arms of each soldier.

          JOHANN
          Most ingenious. A versatile, highly
          mobile killing machine.

          LIZ
          Make that machines, Johann. I see more
          than one.
          Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
          faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.

          HELLBOY
          Wow. You hear that? Listen -
          He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
          backwards...

          HELLBOY
          Uh oh.
          CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,

          -
          the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
          - a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
          dominoes!!

          HELLBOY
          Whoops.
          The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
          falling soldiers bears down on them!!
           Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
          past them until -
          - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
          head of the column.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 105

          PRINCE
          As a boy, they say I enjoyed toy
          soldiers. So do you, I see.
          He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
          aside some of the weapons.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
          Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.

          HELLBOY
          Yeah. Now it's your turn.

          PRINCE
          Do you envy these contraptions? They
          never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
          the zest of combat.
          The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.

          PRINCE
          These fighting men are the very model of
          patience... merely awaiting word from
          their lawful commander.

          AS
          From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments.
          he fits them together...

          PRINCE
          You have the remaining piece, I presume.

          JOHANN
          We do not -

          PRINCE

          (SURPRISED)
          Then you are most foolish.
          He gestures to some troll GUARDS near a tunnel entrance.
          They lead the Princess out in chains.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          You came here expecting what? Mercy?

          JOHANN
          The death you would unleash will never
          happen! What you need is far from here
          and will stay out of your reach forever.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 106
          A VOICE reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind
          them.

          ABE
          Stop - I have it.
          Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
          the palm of his hand.

          ABE

          (APPROACHING)
          Here... For her... Take it...

          JOHANN
          Oh, my God. What has he done?
          Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
          to the Prince.
          Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.

          HELLBOY
          Abe -

          ABE
          (to Hellboy)
          You cannot fight him- not without hurting
          her...

          (BEAT )
          What would you do if it was Liz??
          CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places
          the resulting crown on his head!

          PRINCE
          I am Prince Nuada and I command my army
          to life once more. Does anyone dispute my
          right?
          With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
          comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          (points at the team)
          Kill them.
          Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back.

          ABE
          (to the Prince)
          That was your price!! A ransom, you said -
          paid in good faith!!

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

           HELLBOY 2 107
          ABE(continued)
           (to Hellboy)
          Why, he lied to us!

          HELLBOY
          Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we
          need to talk.
          The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
          friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.

          ABE
          He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a
          highborn heir to the throne, last in a
          noble line of-

          BELLBOY
          Not now, Abe, okay?
          The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
          terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
          his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
          swings it like a club.
          A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
          back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.

          LIZ
          Let me -
          Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
          hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
          oncoming fighters.
          The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
          scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
          hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
          marching on and over their scorched comrades.
          Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
          his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
          He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
          his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
          groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
          At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
          wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.

          JOHANN
          Invincibility!? So - the only one thing
          may stop them -
          Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
          flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 108
          Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
          chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
          Johann rips into the enemy!!
          But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
          dismember it like marauding insects!
          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.

          JOHANN
          Ach. They are too many. Anyone have
          another idea?
          Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
          feet.

          HELLBOY
          (a bellow)
          Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
          command this army!
          With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
          the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
          ledge with his sister.

          ABE
          (follows HB)
          No= please- no-
          Hellboy moves away from him.

          HELLBOY
          A challenge must be answered! Raise your
          sword!

          PRINCE
          A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are
          no one.

          PRINCESS
          No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the
          Fallen one- He has the right!
          Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
          The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
          up his sword.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 10 9

          PRINCE
          Very well.
          (to the BPRD team)
          May his fate show you the cost of pride
          and blindness.
          As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-

          JOHANN
          Hellboy's too weak-
          Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
          drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
          they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
          Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
          looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
          parrying off his enemy.
          Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
          dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
          The Prince is ready to kill him.

          LIZ
          (witness to a nightmare)
          No!! NO! !
          A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps
          forward and...
          Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
          arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
          Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
          red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
          They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
          hatred.
          Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
          raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
          the advantage.
          He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
          Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.

          HELLBOY
          I- have- won-

          PRINCE
          No. You have not-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 110
          He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
          through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
          pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
          Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.

          ABE

          (GASPS)

          NO-
          Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
          blinking in despair.
          The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
          her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.

          PRINCESS
          We'll find each other again, somewhere.
          And she dies in his arms.
          In the center of the arena:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You... think you're any different from
          me? The humans - they will tire of you.
          They will disappoint you. And in the end,
          they will betray you. You... are living a
          lie. Your time will come again. May you
          make a better choice.
          Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
          fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
          Abe's hands...
          Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
          Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
          Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
          segement...
          . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
          heap of scrap metal!
          Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
          another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
          HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
          it explodes in his hands!
          WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
          Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 111

          HELLBOY
          (to the trolls)
          You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
          in the shadows - where you belong.
          As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
          Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.

          DISSOLVE:

          163

          163 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          The BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
          the magical hills.
          Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance.

          164

          164 EXT. TREE -- DAY

          They reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map
          cylinder and fits it into the slot.

          JOHANN
          Any last minute requests?

          ABE
          (very quiet)
          Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real
          world now.
          Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
          and the BPRD team walks through.

          165

          165 EXT. RENVYLE - DAY

          On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
          have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
          countryside, looking for them.
          Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.

          MANNING

          (STARTLED)
          Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-

          BELLBOY
          I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
          that Manning.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 112
          Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
          pack.

          ABE
          Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
          too. For all you've done for us over the
          years.
          He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.

          MANNING
          What? What, exactly is this?

          ABE
          (walking away)
          I quit.
          Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
          shrugs off his pack, too.

          MANNING
          Come on. You're resigning?

          HELLBOY
          Looks that way, doesn't it?
          Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
          back.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          I think I'll keep this.
          He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
          him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
          tightly to the big, red daemon.

          MANNING
          Liz -- not you, too!?
          (to Johann)
          They can't do this. Stop them, Johann-

          JOHANN
          Manning, you're an asshole.

          166 EXT. COASTLINE - DAY 166

          Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off
          at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections.
          Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks.

          EXT.   DERELICT STREET   TWILIGHT
          
          Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city.
          
          The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead.
          Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this
          dark and derelict street.
          
          Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are
          abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris.  Stores
          are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied.
          
          At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can
          fires.
          
          ANGLE ON TWO BUMS
          
           - as their eyes move, following something moving down the
          street.  Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful
          engine.
          
          ANGLE ON STREET
          
          Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an
          incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is
          going shopping.
          
          The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only
          open store on the block.
          
          ANGLE ON STORE
          
          A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the
          store is still trading.  Its windows are grimy, its door
          defaced.  Above the door - barely legible through the accrued
          dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.
          
          ANGLE ON CAR
          
          The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an
          expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out.
          
          JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with
          designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather
          jacket.
          
          For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous
          glances up and down the ruined street.  He shows no anxiety at
          being in this twilight part of town.  Cocooned in the
          confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life.
          Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through
          the doorway.
          
          
          
                                                                      2
          
          INT.   CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES   NIGHT
          
          The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and
          shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper.  It is
          grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended.
          
          It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow
          onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through.
          
          The stock is a strange surreal mix.  Discarded items from 50's
          America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share
          space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata,
          wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment;
          stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really
          be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          He wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances
          at some items.  Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at
          the dust and grime they leave on his fingers.  But his manner
          suggests he is looking for something specific.
          
          Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of
          vaudeville and travelling shows.  It is tall and broad and is
          leaning against something behind it.
          
          ANGLE ON HOARDING
          
           - which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of
          hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters:
          
          YOU WILL BE AMAZED! THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE! FREAKS OF NATURE!
          AN EDUCATIONAL SHOW FOR ALL THE FAMILY PRESENTED UNDER THE
          AUSPICES OF PROFESSOR EMMANUEL BOCKLIN, TRAGEDIAN AND
          MENAGERIST.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he moves the hoarding aside.
          
                                     JP
                        Wow ...
          
          REVEALED is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered
          in beautifully detailed 3-D carvings all in the same matt-black
          finish as the pillar itself.  The pillar is extremely bizarre,
          as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem
          Pole for jaded modern tastes.  The carvings are of dead rats,
          copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces.
          
          One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP
          - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first
          two HELLRAISER pictures.
          
                                                                      3
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its
          calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom.
          
          A voice OFF startles him.
          
                                     BUM
                        You want it?
          
          JP whirls round in shock.  A BUM is standing close to him.
          
          ANGLE ON BUM
          
          He has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard.
          His eyes are a piercing, excited blue.  Otherwise he is
          indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside 
          ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door
          beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street?
          
                                     JP
                        Is it yours?
          
          ANGLE ON BOTH
          
          The Bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly.
          
                                     BUM
                        No.  Not mine.  Yours.
          
          JP nods, still a little uncertain.
          
                                     JP
                        How much do you want for it?
          
                                     BUM
                        Whatever you think its worth.
          
          JP digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of
          cash.  Without counting or checking, he proffers it.
          
          The Bum's hand flies out and siezes JP's, pressing the money
          between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp.
          
          In the background, OUT OF FOCUS, is Pinhead's face on the
          pillar.
          
                                     BUM (OFF)
                        Enjoy ...
          
          
                                                                      4
          
          The FOCUS switches so that the hands in foreground BLUR and
          Pinhead's frozen face becomes SHARP, as if he is silently
          watching this deal take place.
          
          The Bum's hand moves away with the money as we
          
          FADE TO BLACK
          
          
          INT.   HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM   NIGHT
          
          BLACKNESS.   Voice OVER.
          
                                     JOEY
                        It's a mystery to me ...
          
          SMASH-CUT to full-frame VIDEO IMAGE image of JOANNE
          SUMMERSKILL, standing and looking directly into camera, as if
          we are watching a TV broadcast.  In shot behind her is a quiet
          hospital Emergency Room - no patients, no staff, just beds and
          intensive-care equipment.
          
          Joanne - or JOEY, as she prefers to be called - is 23 years
          old, an attractive and clever brunette, with a quiet sadness in
          her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden.
          
          Dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a TV newsperson, she
          holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station, W-QQY.
          
          Her direct address to the unseen TV camera continues.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Most nights this inner-city Emergency
                        Room would be a chaos of blood and panic
                        and grace under pressure.  But tonight,
                        as you see, it's like Death took a
                        holiday.  It's a mystery to me ... A
                        mystery how those assholes at
                        Assignments knew it.  This is Joey
                        Summerskill for W-QQY.  Emergency Room.
                        No story.  Really, really pissed off.
          
          Despite the nature of her last few words, Joey has ironically
          kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster.  Now, she
          breaks mood, looks away from the camera, and, with a dismissive
          wave of the hand, begins to walk out of shot.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Ah, break it down, Doc.  It's a bust.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
           - to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but
          are in the ER in real time.  As well as Joey, the room contains
          her cameraman ("DOC" FISHER) and an ER NURSE.
                                                                      5
          
          Doc - a 45 year old with a weight problem, a nicotine
          addiction, and a cynical attitude - lowers a shoulder-mounted
          Video camera and watches Joey walk to a water-cooler against a
          wall. His expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy.
          
          The Nurse is a middle-aged woman of Asian ancestry.  She has a
          puzzled expression as she addresses Doc.
          
                                     NURSE
                        She can talk like this on television?
                        She can say this thing?  This assholes?
          
          Doc replies but keeps his eyes on Joey as he crosses to her.
          
                                     DOC
                        No sweat, sweetheart.  It's for the
                        European satellite ....  Joey; rein it
                        in, kid.  They couldn't've known.
          
          Joey sucks angrily at water from a paper-cup and then crushes
          and bins the cup like an act of revenge.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I know.  I know.  But it's just so ...
                        neat, isn't it?  The first gig that
                        isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's
                        taken away from me.
          
                                     DOC
                        Yeah, well like you said - it's a
                        mystery.  But that's all it is.
                        Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think
                        the station paid off every accident
                        victim in the city to ... ?
          
          Doc is interrupted by the RINGING of a cell-phone he has
          holstered at his waist.  He picks it up.
          
                                     DOC
                        Speak.

                                     DOC
                        OK.  Listen - Joey's here.  Shall ...

                        Hurry.  You've got ambulances to beat.
          
          The line goes dead.  Doc looks at Joey.  She heard it all.  He
          shrugs apologetically.
          
                                                                      6

                        OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story
                        of your life could be right round the
                        corner.
          
                                     JOEY
                        That is the story of my life.
          
          With a rueful smile, Joey watches Doc leave.
          
          Joey and the Nurse exchange glances - Joey's impassive but
          vaguely friendly, the Nurse's a little disapproving; if the
          camera's gone, what the hell are YOU still doing here?
          
          
          INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT
          
          Joey makes her solitary way along a medium-length corridor
          that has two sets of double swing doors at either end, one set
          giving on to the ER, the other toward an exit.  Joey is heading
          for the latter, her mood sad and defeated.
          
          ANGLE ON EXIT DOORS
          
          Suddenly - SMASH! - the doors burst open from the other side.
          
          ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
          
          The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled
          rapidly through the doors.
          
          Two PARAMEDICS, both male, both about Joey's age, are pushing
          the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other.  They
          completely ignore Joey and also ignore the TEENAGE GIRL who is
          running beside the gurney.
          
          The girl - TERRI - is 18 or 19.  She is a pale-faced blonde
          dressed as if for a Desperately-Seeking-Susan party and is
          keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses.
          
          
          
                                                                      7
          
          As Joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them
          pass, it is neither the paramedics nor Terri that get her
          attention.  It is the BOY on the gurney.
          
          ANGLE ON GURNEY/BOY
          
          The teenage boy lies flat on his back semi-conscious, his
          eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow.
          
          Horribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long,
          heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor.
          There are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried
          in his skin.
          
          ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
          
          The DIALOGUE as the gurney is rushed to the ER doors is RAPID-
          FIRE and OVERLAPPED, the Paramedics responding only to each
          other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions.
          
                                     TERRI
                        It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault.
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 1
                        10 milligram IV Valium stat.  How the
                        fuck did this happen ... ?!
          
                                     TERRI
                        It was outside.  I wasn't even with him.
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 2
                        You ever see anything like this before?
          
                                     TERRI
                        He must have stolen it.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What's going on?
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 1
                        Yeah, sure.  Five times a fucking day.
                        Just push!
          
          Once the gurney has passed her, Joey runs along behind it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        It was off the statue.  In the club.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What happened to him?
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 2
                        Think they'll get him back?
          
          
                                                                      8
          
                                     TERRI
                        It's nothing to do with me.
          
                                      PARAMEDIC 1
                        Worst case of status I've seen.  Even
                        money at best.
          
          The foot of the gurney slams into the ER doors and the
          Paramedics slide it rapidly through.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait!  I'm a reporter!  Tell me where he
                        was ...
          
          ANGLE ON ER THROUGH DOORS
          
          The Nurse and a middle-aged DOCTOR are seen through the doors
          preparing emergency equipment.  The Doctor already has
          fibrillator pads in his hands.
          
          The Paramedics follow the gurney through and, turning rapidly,
          push the doors closed from the inside.
          
          ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
          
          Joey and Terri are alone, excluded from the ER activity. Joey
          turns to speak but Terri is already halfway to the other doors.
          
          Joey runs after her.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need
                        talk to you.
          
                                     TERRI
                               (over her shoulder)
                        It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't
                        even with him.
          
          Joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors.
          She grabs at her arm to slow her down.
          
          Terri turns, snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce
          anger.  She backs toward the doors, making gestures of
          dismissal and denial with her hands.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my
                        problem!  I was just there!
          
                                     JOEY
                        Where?
          
          
          
                                                                      9
          
                                     TERRI
                        Under The Underground.  Can I like GO
                        now?!
          
                                     JOEY
                        Under the Underground?  What's that?
                        Where is ...
          
          Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly
          loud SCREAM, agonized and terrified, coming from the ER.
          
          Both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different:
          Joey turns instantly and runs back toward the ER.  Terri
          watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors.
          
          The SCREAM continues, a howling horrible sound.
          
          Joey reaches the ER doors and throws them open.  And freezes in
          terrified shock.
          
          
          INT.  EMERGENCY ROOM   NIGHT
          
          THE DOCTOR
          
           - is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force.
          The fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression
          is awe-struck and disbelieving.
          
          THE NURSE
          
           - is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments,
          muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross.
          
          THE TWO PARAMEDICS
          
           - are flattened against the far wall, terror on their faces.
          
          ANGLE ON TABLE
          
          The Boy is on the emergency table.  It's him that's screaming.
          His body is arched tight in shock, eyes and mouth wide open.
          
          He's wired up to an ECG and the MONITOR shows a heartbeat that
          should be measured on the Richter scale.
          
          The chains - all still connected to his face and his body  are
          rigid and tight, being pulled straight up into the air as if
          tugged taut by invisible hands.
          
          The boy's skin is stretched and pulled at those points where
          the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible
          that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues.
          
          
                                                                      10
          
          The scene is held for a terrible frozen moment.  Then suddenly
          the chains drop, the scream stops, and the boy's body slumps.
          
          There is a massive ELECTRICAL SURGE.  The ECG flat-lines before
          it and the other monitors go haywire, sparking and spluttering.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          The lights in the room flicker and strobe.
          
          The fibrillator pads arc angrily. The Doctor flings them away.
          
          ELECTRIC ENERGY seems to run along the slumped chains and they
          disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown.
          
          Lighting and machinery return to normal (ECG still flat-lining)
          and the medical staff stare thunder-struck at the dead boy.
          
          For the first time, the other people in the ER become aware of
          Joey's presence in the doorway.
          
                                     DOCTOR
                        Who's that?  Get her out of here!
          
          The Nurse heads for the doors.  Joey is already backing away.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH DOORS INTO CORRIDOR
          
           - as Joey backs away, an expression of numbed shock on her
          face.  The doors close over, blocking her out.
          
          ANGLE ON FIBRILLATOR PADS
          
           - still arcing.
          
          CROSS-FADE TO
          
          
          INT.   CROSS-TOWN BUS    NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on flickering neon light in the bus cabin.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - glancing at the light from her seat.
          
          JOEY'S POV - VARIOUS ANGLES
          
          The bus is almost deserted.  Three other passengers - A PUNK, A
          BAG LADY, and A WINO - are spread out around the interior.  All
          seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated
          stares highlight Joey's isolation and tension.  Fear has
          entered her life.
          
          
                                                                      11
          
          The bus moves through the neon-lit loneliness of downtown
          streets.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - her face, lit by reflected store-signs and street-lights, is
          lost and distant, as if she is submerged in some dream-sea of
          memory and sadness.
          
          INT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   DAY
          
          A wall of TV monitors, each monitor showing Joey sitting on a
          couch with a painfully thin older woman - BRITTANY VERTUE.
          
          Brittany's probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth as
          surgery can make it.  She is dressed in the standard uniform of
          the health-avatar; brightly-colored leotard over black tights.
          
          Joey has a big paperback book - BEYOND HUNGER; THE BRITTANY
          VERTUE GUIDE TO HOLISTIC DIETING - which she holds to camera.
          She smiles and, turning to face Brittany, crosses her legs.
          
          The image freezes.  And replays.  Joey crosses her legs again.
          And again.  And again.
          
                                     BRAD
                                    (over)
                        See?  This is what I mean.  Your
                        technique is all wrong.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          Joey (in real time) is sitting in an easy chair in the editing
          suite looking at the wall of monitors.
          
          BRAD, a techie in his late-twenties, and DOC FISHER are in
          swivel chairs immediately in front of the video console.
          
          All three are drinking coffee.  Doc is smoking a cigarette.
          
                                     JOEY
                                  (guardedly)
                        What do you mean?
          
                                     BRAD
                        I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling
                        you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on
                        the leg-cross ... and you're made.
          
          Doc chuckles in a half-friendly, half-sleazy way.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Fuck you.
          
          
                                                                      12 
          
                                     BRAD
                        What, you think I'm kidding?  I
                        guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys
                        upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an
                        anchor-woman.
          
                                     JOEY

                        Jesus Christ ...
          
                                     DOC
                        Ah, give her a break.
          
          Doc leans over and stops the tape.
          
                                     BRAD
                                   (to Doc)
                        What's with you?
          
          He swivels his chair round to face Joey.
          
                                     BRAD
                        C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help
                        you hit a home run here.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It
                        may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I
                        want to do it the right way.  Not tight
                        skirts.  Tight stories.
          
                                     BRAD
                        Right.  Like last night's doozie.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I know what I saw.
          
                                     BRAD
                        And I believe what you say.  But this is
                        TV.  No pictures, no story.
          
                                     DOC
                        Yeah, too bad I had to go and ...
          
                                     BRAD
                        ... and cover something on Planet Earth.
                        See, you gotta remember, Joey; this is a
                        LOCAL station.  As in local to this
                        galaxy.
          
          Joey slams her coffee mug down and stands up.
          
                                     JOEY
                        There's a story out there.
          
                                                                      13
          
                                     BRAD
                               (jumping in warningly)
                        Not on station time.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My
                        time.
          
          Joey exits.  Brad watches her leave with a half-smile on his
          face then turns to Doc.
          
                                     BRAD
                        Lot of attitude there, Doc ...
          
          He starts up the video tape again and, on the monitors, Joey
          once again crosses her legs on the couch.
          
                                     BRAD
                        ... but great legs.
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on a screaming male face, twisted as in pain or fury.
          
          PULL BACK rapidly to REVEAL the face belongs to the lead singer
          of THANATOS.  He is on a nightclub stage with the rest of the
          band, all of them dressed in that shit-poor-white-trash-on-dope
          look favored by all such rich young businessmen with guitars.
          
          A tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims: UNDER
          THE UNDERGROUND PRESENTS THANATOS.
          
          The SCREAM ends, replaced with the roaring thunder of drums and
          guitars as Thanatos kick into some thrash-metal.
          
          The dance-floor of the club is packed with KIDS dancing to the
          incredibly fast, incredibly loud music.
          
          Many of the kids favor the same look as the band but it's not
          exclusive; college types are there too, along with some  male
          and female - sporting the glitz-meets-sleaze look of Terri.
          
          The club itself is of course dimly-lit and the basic decor is
          black.  Where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is in
          the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from the
          ceiling and walls, all in tones of black, silver and gray:
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON SCULPTURES
          
          A headless, armless torso wrapped in barbed wire.
          
          A pair of male and female heads.  Bonsai-like trees grow out of
          every orifice - eye-sockets, nostrils, ears, and mouths.
          
                                                                      14
          
          A human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled
          open and pinned out to reveal inside - instead of bone and
          sinew - an entire miniature metropolis, beautifully detailed.
          
          A black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON CLUB
          
          Kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of the
          dance floor.  It is a hot, sweaty, faintly aggressive
          atmosphere - people jostling for position, shouting to be
          heard, etc etc.
          
          The camera finds Joey - incongruous by dress and demeanor 
          pushing her way among the crowd.
          
          The music is too loud and overpowering to hear Joey's voice but
          it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club that
          she is approaching various people and enquiring after Terri.
          
          FOUR KIDS AT A TABLE
          
          - shake their heads and shrug.
          
          A PUNK
          
          - stares blankly and blinks.
          
          TWO BIMBOS
          
          - giggle, purse their lips, shake their heads.
          
          JOEY
          
           - catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance
          floor and pushes through the crowd to follow.  She taps the
          figure's arm but, as it turns, she realizes it is a man  some
          70's revivalist GLITTER-ROCKER.  He looks quizzically at her.
          
          Joey's mouth moves and this time she seems to get some
          response.  The Glitter-Rocker mouths a name.
          
          Joey can't hear him.  She hands him a business card and a pen.
          
          He scrawls a name on the back of the card and Joey nods her
          thanks as he moves on.
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON CARD
          
           - as Joey reads the name "Terri" on it.  She flips the card to
          reveal her name and number and writes "Terri - Please call!".
          
          ANGLE ON BAR
          
          
                                                                      15
          
           - as Joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a BARMAN
          who looks at it, nods, and puts it beneath the counter.
          
          ANGLE ON EXIT
          
           - as Joey makes her way out.
          
          ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR
          
          Camera moves into the tightly-packed throng on the dance floor,
          making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center.
          
          The crowd parts slightly to reveal, in the direct center of the
          floor, the tall black pillar from the opening sequence.
          
          The pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele
          dance around it.  It seems very in keeping with the decor of
          the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence.
          
          The pillar has been mounted upside down, so that it looks even
          odder than our first glimpse of it.  Near the bottom the
          inverted face of Pinhead, black and frozen, can be seen.
          
          The camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion
          to the pillar's own movement and, as it does so, draws closer
          and closer making for a disorienting, vertiginous image.
          
          As this happens, the raucous sound of the band Thanatos begins
          to fade into a whirl of ECHO and to be replaced by a whirring,
          spinning, sound which we only recognize fully as we
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          EXT.   DENSE JUNGLE   DAY     (JOEY'S DREAM)
          
          The screen is filled with dense jungle foliage.
          
          The chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of
          Helicopter blades, one element of a SOUND MONTAGE conveying the
          sense and feel of a Jungle War; Helicopters in flight, machine
          gun fire, distant explosions, confused shouts and cries.
          
          A POV camera pushes its way through the lush, humid greenery.
          
          The camera seems to be searching for something, glancing this
          way and that, shoving leaves and tall grass aside.
          
          Voices begin to emerge clearly from the SOUND MASS off-screen
          as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal.
          
                                     SOLDIER 1
                                   (off)
                        Call for a Medi-Vac!
          
                                                                      16
          
                                     SOLDIER 2
                                   (off)
                        Don't die, man!  Don't fucking die!
          
          The dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the
          POV camera.  Pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage,
          it finally gains a clearer view and stops, looking ahead.
          
          In a tiny clearing, ten feet from the camera, still partially
          obscured by the jungle, two camouflage-clad SOLDIERS lean over
          the prone body of a third.  It is unclear due to distance but
          there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
          
          A new sound joins the SOUND MONTAGE - a persistent, rhythmic,
          ringing sound.  The other elements die away until only this is
          left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          INT.   BEDROOM, JOEY'S APARTMENT   NIGHT
          
          Joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues.  Confused
          and disoriented, her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if
          she's trying to understand where she is and what is happening.
          
          Finally, she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside
          table to pick it up.
          
          ANGLE ON BEDSIDE TABLE
          
           - favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the
          phone.  Its warm green figures show the time is 2:35.
          
                                     JOEY
                               (off. Sleepily)
                        God.  This better be birth, marriage, or
                        death ...
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she picks up the handset and puts it to her ear.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Uh-huh?
          
                                     TERRI
                               (on phone)
                        Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne
                        Summerskill?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
          
          
                                                                      17
          
                                     TERRI
                        You like ... left me a card?  At the
                        club?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Right.  Right!
          
          Joey swings out of bed to sit on the edge, much more alert now.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I want to talk to you.  We met ... now,
                        listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at
                        the hospital last night.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll
                        make a deal with you ... My boyfriend
                        threw me out, right?  I'll trade you.
                        You give me couch-space.  I'll give you
                        talk.  OK?
          
          Joey can't resist another glance at the clock.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
          
                                     TERRI
                               (Surprised at Joey's surprise.
                                Bit of a culture clash here)
                        Of course tonight.  Is that a problem?
                        Like, if you've got a guy there or
                        something ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was
                        having bad dreams anyway.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.    NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on the front door of the apartment as it opens to reveal
          Terri leaning against the doorframe.
          
          Clad identically to how we last saw her, Terri clutches a well-
          stuffed leather bag, containing all her worldly possessions.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Hi.  How're you doing?
          
          Not waiting for either reply or invitation, she moves forward.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
                                                                      18
          
           - as Terri walks past the dressing-gowned Joey and heads
          straight for Joey's sofa and sprawls on it, laying her bag on
          the floor beside her.
          
                                     TERRI
                        You got anything to drink?
          
          Joey closes the door, raised eyebrows registering her slight
          disapproval at Terri's cavalier attitude.  Her voice, however,
          is polite.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I put some decaf on.  Er ... make
                        yourself comfortable.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Right.
          
          Joey walks past Terri and through to her kitchen, from where we
          hear the sound of COFFEE BEING POURED.
          
          Terri looks around at Joey's room.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON ROOM
          
          The large and spacious room suggests that even if Joey is
          dissatisfied with her job she's at least being paid enough to
          make it bearable.  The room is very ordered, very neat, but
          stops short of being prissy.
          
          A very large picture window takes up all of one wall.  At the
          moment of course the drapes are closed.  Another wall is taken
          up by a huge shelf unit packed with books, videos, and CDs.
          Joey's obsession with "getting the whole story" seems to be
          true of her personal life as well as her professional.
          
          ANGLE ON TERRI
          
           - having finished her quick examination, she calls out.
          
                                     TERRI
                        So ... what was your bad dream?
          
          Joey re-enters, carrying two mugs of coffee.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Your dream.  You said you were having a
                        bad dream.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh yeah ...
          
                                                                      19
          
          She hands one coffee to Terri and sits opposite her.
          
                                     JOEY
                        ... well, I've been having it for years.
                        It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's
                        ... well, I know what it is.
          
                                     TERRI
                        What is it?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Why are you so interested?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Sorry.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
          
                                     TERRI
                               (sympathetic, knowing)
                        Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
          
                                     JOEY
                        God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he
                        died before I was born.  He died in
                        Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met
                        him.  We don't even know the details.  I
                        dream of battlefields.  Of searching.
                        Of trying to find out.
          
                                     TERRI
                        That's great.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What?
          
                                     TERRI
                        No ... I mean, it's not like great about
                        your dad or anything.  It's just I don't
                        dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help
                        if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ...
                        No, so it's always neat for me to hear
                        about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like
                        everybody has another world except me.
                        You know what I mean?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I know what you're saying but ... Never?
                        You've never had a dream?  No, you know,
                        you do.  You must.  What you mean is you
                        don't remember them.
          
          
          
                                                                      20
          
                                     TERRI
                        Whatever.  All I know is - this is it
                        for me.  Just me, my bag, and a series
                        of shithead boyfriends.  It'd be good to
                        see something else.  Have a nighttime
                        life.  Be somebody different.
          
          Terri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Hey ... this is great, isn't it?  Just
                        girls talking.  Like having a
                        conversation?  Good coffee.  You got a
                        cigarette?
          
          Joey waits, letting herself catch up with Terri's good-natured
          but marginally strung-out personality.  She looks around the
          room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Uh ...  yeah.  Yeah, somewhere.  Wait a
                        minute.
          
          Joey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed
          pack of cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind
          a shelf of videos.  We notice that the videos are THE WORLD AT
          WAR, volumes 1 thru 26.  She brings the smokes to Terri.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I'm trying to quit.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You
                        think you're going to live forever?
          
          She smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs, smiles,
          and takes one.  Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it. A huge
          FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror
          from Terri.  Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and closes
          the lid extinguishing the flame.  Terri draws a book of matches
          from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's
                        temperamental.
          
                                     TERRI
                        It's okay.  It's just someone burned me
                        once.
          
          
          
                                                                      21
          
          Joey takes the book of matches from Terri's hands and lights
          both cigarettes.  Terri takes a long, fearful look at the
          burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her
          cigarette.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Wanna know how I look at it?  Way I see
                        it is ... you give up, right?  Three
                        days later, you get hit by a fucking
                        truck and you know - you just KNOW 
                        that your last thought as you go under
                        those wheels'd be "Jesus H. Christ, I
                        coulda smoked another three packs!"
          
          She lays the book of matches down.  Joey's eyes go to them.
          
          ANGLE ON MATCHES
          
          Black letters on the dark-grey cover: UNDER THE UNDERGROUND.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY AND TERRI
          
          Terri's eyes flick to the match-book and her mood changes,
          becoming subdued and a little sullen.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yes I do.  Terri, something awful
                        happened to that boy.  I have to find
                        out what it was.
          
                                     TERRI
                        But I don't know anything!  Really.  I
                        just came out of the club and the kid
                        was already in the street.  He ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        Did you know him?
          
                                     TERRI
                        No.  I'd seen him in there a few times
                        before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never
                        like danced with him or anything.
                        Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've
                        taken it from the statue.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Taken what?
          
                                     TERRI
                        The thing!  He was lying there in the
                        street, moaning.  But he pointed at it
                        ...
                                                                      22
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait a minute.  He was already ...
                        wounded ... when you found him?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it
                        was lying next to him.  And he pointed
                        at it before he passed out and ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the
                        chains come from?
          
                                     TERRI
                        That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
          
          Terri rummages in her bag, getting hold of something.
          
                                     TERRI
                        He said they came out of this.
          
          She holds her hand out and the camera TRACKS in to meet it.
          
          ANGLE ON TERRI'S HAND/BOX
          
          Resting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square.  It
          has the same matt-black carbonized look as the pillar and is
          recognizable as one of the "carvings" we saw on it.
          
          There is fine filigree pattern-work over each of its surfaces
          and, to audiences familiar with the HELLRAISER movies, the box
          is recognizable despite its black coating; it is the Lament
          Configuration, the puzzle box that opens the doors to Hell.
          
          There is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of
          the box - presumably where the boy from ER had broken it off
          the pillar.  Camera favors this jagged shard as we
          
          CROSS-FADE TO
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
          VERY CLOSE on its upper left section.  We are looking at a hole
          in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the Box.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          The club is empty.  The dim lighting of working hours has been
          replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes
          and the club has that eerie not-quite-right look that all night
          places have when subjected to a harsher light.
          
                                                                      23
          
          Two WORKERS are in the final stages of clearing the night's
          debris - emptying trash into big black plastic bags, wiping
          down tables and bars etc.
          
          Work completed, they head to the main exit.
          
          One of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent
          clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting.
          The other shouts across the apparently deserted club.
          
                                     WORKER
                        All done, Mr. Monroe.
          
          They stand a second but no response comes.  The first turns to
          the second and shrugs.
          
                                     WORKER
                               (mouthing silently)
                        Ass hole.
          
          His co-worker grins and they let themselves out.
          
          A beat.  Another door opens into the club and JP Monroe  the
          club's owner and the man we saw buy the pillar -  walks into
          the main room of the club from his private room at the back.
          
          JP walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom.
          He describes a circle around the dance floor, throwing glances
          at his odd sculptures, and finally walks into the center of the
          room to stand before the pride of his collection, the pillar.
          
          The pillar of course is stationary at this time, though it is
          still mounted upside down.
          
          JP smiles possessively at the pillar - and then registers the
          mutilation where the Box has been ripped away.
          
                                     JP
                        What the ... ?
          
          He leans in closer to stare at the hole.
          
          Suddenly, jarringly, there is a quiet but distinct SQUEAK that
          seems to come from within the hole.
          
          JP starts back a little, a small expression of anxiety on his
          normally supercilious face.  He glances to right and left, gets
          a grip, and leans forward again.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE
          
           - as, again, the noise comes.  Is it a squeak - or is it the
          creaking shifting of hidden machinery, hidden chains?
          
          
                                                                      24
          
          JP's hand moves tentatively into shot, approaching the hole.
          Slowly, slowly, it reaches wrist-deep into the blackness.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          VERY CLOSE on JP's face - quizzical, enquiring ... and suddenly
          contorted in pain!
          
                                     JP
                        Aaaaaahh!!
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE
          
           - as JP's hand whips out of the hole, shaking in shock and
          pain.  A rat is hanging on to one of JP's fingers, its sharp
          teeth buried in the flesh!
          
          JP swings his arm violently through the air, dislodging the rat
          with the force of his swing.  A spray of blood is seen to come
          from JP's wounded finger.
          
          ANGLE ON RAT
          
           - as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and
          scurries away deeper into the darkness, squeaking furiously.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he looks down at his finger, face snarling.
          
                                     JP
                        Son of a ...
          
          ANGLE ON FINGER
          
          VERY CLOSE.  Blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks.
          
                                     JP
                                   (off)
                        ... bi ...
          
          JP's voice is cut off by a strange SIZZLING NOISE heard OFF.
          
          JP's face moves up to look at the pillar.  A look of awe and
          shock crosses his face.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
          Some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness
          of the pillar.  The sizzling noise is coming from them.
          
          Suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby
          of blood - already larger than possibility would allow.  Then
          it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or
          seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
                                                                      25
          
          The streams of blood don't simply fall straight.  They seem to
          follow some pre-gouged pattern, running down the pillar tracing
          the blackened organic contours of the carvings.
          
          They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then
          separate again, running over his frozen black face along the
          carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
          
          When every canal line on the demon's face is filled neatly with
          blood, a BLUE LIGHT seems to glow from within the pillar
          through Pinhead's face, giving it temporarily the blue tone he
          had enjoyed in (un)life.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          CLOSE on his awe-struck face - bathed in reflected blue light.
          
          ANGLE ON PINHEAD
          
           - as gradually the blueness subsides again, the visible blood
          vanishing with it, leaving the same frozen implacable blackness
          as before but charged now with a waiting power.

          CLOSE ON STOVE TOP
          
          A frying pan sits atop a burner.  it contains the ugliest mess
          of scrambled eggs you have ever seen ... or perhaps it's an
          omelette.  There are other ingredients in there but they're
          burnt so black they're unrecognizable.  At least half of the
          mixture lies all over the stove top instead of in the pan.
          
                                     JOEY

          VARIOUS ANGLES
          
           - showing the chaos all around the kitchen: Spilled flour on
          work surfaces; Egg-shells on the linoleum; A knocked-over glass
          of orange juice, the juice soaking into a piece of kitchen
          roll; Coffee as black and thick as a mix of Indian ink and
          molasses.

          Joey, in her dressing-gown, stands in the doorway with a
          shocked expression on her face.
          
          Terri, in an oversized man's shirt, stands by the stove holding
          a fish-slice and smiling nervously.
          
                                     TERRI
                        I figured I'd make breakfast.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice
                        of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always
                        this ... exploratory?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time.
                        Kitchen virgin, that's me.
          
          Joey nods slowly, crossing to a cabinet and taking out some
          instant coffee.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I'll boil some water.
          
                                     TERRI
                        I'll do it!
          
                                     JOEY
                        No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love
                        boiling water.  It's a specialty of
                        mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
          
          Joey watches Terri walk out of the kitchen, sighs in relief,
          and grabs the kettle.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S AP'T.
          
          Joey sits, drinking her coffee, as Terri walks round the room
          with hers.
          
                                     TERRI
                        This is great.  And it's yours?  You
                        like own it?
          
                                     JOEY
                        The bank owns it.  But I'm working on
                        it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I
                        haven't even had a room of my own since
                        I was fifteen years old.
          
          
                                                                      27
          
                                     JOEY
                        How have you ... ?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
          
          Terri walks past Joey's TV set (sound down, cartoons playing).
          
          ANGLE ON TV
          
          The Box is on top of the TV.  In the warm light of morning it
          seems innocuous and harmless, like just another ornament.
          
          DIFFERENT ANGLE
          
           - as Terri walks on, pausing by the shelves of books.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of
                        course I've read them.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like
                        all these people discovering who they
                        used to be.  You know, like
                        reincarnation?  It was really good.  You
                        ever read that?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't think so.  But it's a
                        fascinating subject.  Did you ...
          
          But Terri has already moved on.  She is by the big picture
          window.  The drapes are now open.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Great view!  Great view!  Look at this!
          
          Joey stands and walks to join Terri.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Actually, I'm pretty familiar with the
                        view ...
          
          GIRLS' POV - THROUGH WINDOW
          
          Joey's apartment is on a high floor and her window overlooks
          many lower buildings, giving a view of the city beyond.
          
          
          
          
                                                                      28
          
                                     JOEY
                                    (off)
                        ... but it is good.  You know, over to
                        the left, you can ...
          
                                     TERRI
                               (looking to right and pointing)
                        Who's that?
          
          On the flat roof of a nearby building, a RETARDED TEENAGE BOY
          sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small
          Jerry-built pigeon coop.  Its door is open and it is empty.
          
          The boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude, his
          stillness, and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an
          atmosphere of sadness and loss.
          
          As Joey tells his story, we INTERCUT between the POV of the
          roof and the girls at the window.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't know his name ...  I saw the
                        whole story.  A wounded bird was on his
                        roof.  I could hear its cries from here.
                        He went straight to it.  I couldn't've.
                        I'd be frozen between pity and fear.
                        But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly
                        to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it.
                        Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday
                        he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the
                        pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn.
                        Learn that there was one more thing he
                        had to do to make the rescue complete.
                        And one day, just as afternoon became
                        evening, he leaned over, opened the
                        cage, and walked away.  Didn't look
                        back.  But he heard the sound of its
                        wings.
          
                                     TERRI
                        And he still sits there?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Every day.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  He knows it won't.  It was his
                        final act of love and part of him knows
                        that and part of him doesn't yet.
          
          
          
                                                                      29
          
                                     TERRI
                        Bullshit!  He should've kept it.  It'd
                        live longer!  It's dangerous out there!
                        People get hurt!
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What?  I wasn't talking about ... I ...
                        Do you want to stay?  You want to stay
                        here for a while?
          
          Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile.
          
          Joey crosses to the TV, picks up the Box and weighs it in her
          hand.
          
                                     JOEY
                        OK.  OK.  It's a done deal.  But look 
                        you have to help me.  I've got to solve
                        this thing.  I've got to know what's
                        going on.
          
          Terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa.
          
                                     TERRI
                        But I don't know what's going on.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Maybe not.  But you know more than I do.
                        You know something about this box.
                        Something about a statue?

                        Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it
                        and I figured ...

                        owns the club.  You know?  You were
                        there?  He bought the statue.

                        friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there
                        was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa
                        weird shit in there.  I saw this statue.
                        Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it.
                        You've seen the club.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Would you know this store again?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Sure.  Why?
          
                                     JOEY
                        It's Saturday morning.  Let's go
                        shopping.
          
          
          EXT.   DERELICT STREET   DAY
          
          Joey's Mazda 323 drives down the street.
          
          The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No
          bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.  It has the feel of a ghost
          town, as if nothing has breathed here for years.
          
          ANGLE IN CAR
          
          Joey, at the wheel, has a disbelieving look on her face.
          
          Terri, smoking, flicks ash through her wound-down window.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
          
                                     JOEY
                        What on earth were you doing down here?
          
          An evasive silence.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Buying some drugs, alright?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh, Terri ...
          
          
          
                                                                      31
          
                                     TERRI
                        For somebody else, alright?  Not for me.
                        I don't do that shit anymore.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Then you shouldn't even be around it.
                        You know, it's ...
          
                                     TERRI
                        Here!  Here!  Pull over!
          
          Joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store.
          
          Terri scrambles out of the passenger door.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah.  See.  I told you it was here.
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she looks at Terri from behind, her face worried for her
          new and screwed-up friend.
          
          
          INT.   CARDUCCIS ANTIQUES   DAY
          
          Joey and Terri enter the store.
          
          The store is different, its selection of merchandise reduced.
          The 50's and 60's junk hardware is still there, along with some
          of the more mundane Victoriana, but it seems more "normal" 
          none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia are there.
          
          Also, because it is daylight, the store seems merely old,
          interesting, and musty, not creepy or odd.
          
          There seems to be no-one in attendance.
          
          ANGLE ON GIRLS
          
           - as they walk through the store.
          
                                     MAMA
                                    (off)
                        Can I help?
          
          The voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the
          counter as MAMA CARDUCCI moves into view from beneath it.
          
          Mama, an ancient and slightly eccentric Italian-American woman
          eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasn't had a
          customer in decades.  Not aggressive, just surprised.
          
          
          
                                                                      32
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yes.  Thank you.  We were wondering ...
                        Terri, show her the box.
          
          Terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up.
          
                                     MAMA
                        No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my
                        customers.  Have you tried ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  No, you don't understand.  We're
                        not selling it.  It came from here.  We
                        want ...
          
                                     MAMA
                        Everything sold as is.  No guarantees.
                        No returns.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  We want ...
          
                                     MAMA
                        I took back everything bought on a whim,
                        I'd have no business.  I ...
          
                                     TERRI
                        Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give
                        her a break.
          
          A sudden silence.  Both Mama and Joey stare at Terri in
          surprise.
          
          Mama looks back at Joey.
          
                                     MAMA
                        Quite a mouth.  So what's the problem?
                        You tell me.  You I like.
          
          Joey smiles.  Terri raises her eyes to heaven.  Mama waits.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Thank you.  This came off a ... statue?
                        A pillar.  We wondered if you knew
                        anything about the piece.  About where
                        it came from.
          
          Mama squints at the box, as if trying to recognize it.
          
                                     MAMA
                        Oh ... yeah.  Yeah.  That thing.  Ugly.
                        Real ugly.  I sold that?
          
          Mama's eyes scan the store.
          
                                                                      33
          
                                     MAMA
                        Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made
                        the store feel strange.  Who'd make such
                        a thing?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us
                        anything about it?
          
                                     MAMA
                        It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony-
                        bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What else came with it?  Anything still
                        here?
          
                                     MAMA
                        Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff
                        nobody'd ever want.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Can we see?
          
                                     MAMA
                        You gonna buy?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't know.  Maybe.
          
                                     MAMA
                        Right at the back there.  Middle
                        shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff.
                        I'd do you a good price.
          
          CUT TO:
          
          ANGLE ON REAR OF STORE
          
          Joey and Terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall.
          
          A shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden
          floor a few yards in front of the shelves.
          
          Joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and
          begins to look through it.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri, check out the other folder.
          
          Terri, still holding her purse and the box, looks around for
          somewhere to put them.  All the shelves are full.  She lays
          them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey at
          the shelves, grabbing up the second folder.
          
                                                                      34
          
                                     TERRI
                        What am I looking for?
          
                                     JOEY
                        God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
          
          Terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she
          flicks through the contents.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Jesus.  You're gonna pay her for this
                        shit?  It's like fucking business papers
                        for God's sake!
          
          Bored, Terri wanders off to lean against another shelf-unit.
          
          ANGLE OVER JOEY'S SHOULDER ON FOLDER
          
           - as she flicks through the contents.
          
          Terri's dismissive summary seems justified.  All Joey sees are
          obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork.  Each item is
          letter-headed THE CHANNARD INSTITUTE.
          
          Joey's hand reaches a large envelope.  Scrawled in hand across
          it is the phrase DR. CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS.  Joey draws
          the contents out and begins to sift through them.
          
          The first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an
          officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920.  Joey blows the
          dust from the photo.
          
          LOW ANGLE - ON BOX
          
           - which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust
          from the photo settling next to it.
          
          ON JOEY
          
          The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman.  Joey flips
          it over.  Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says
          COTTON, KIRSTY  CASE NO.  5719.
          
          ON BOX
          
          The sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF
          and then FADES as something strange begins to happen.
          
          Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by
          an invisible wind.  It is drawn up so that it forms an
          impossible spiral in the air.  Spinning like a miniature
          hurricane, it hovers over the box.  The sunlight seems to grow
          brighter.  Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or
          is the box itself glowing and shining?
          
                                                                      35
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE
          
           - as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ...
          
          Joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what
          she is seeing ...
          
          The next item in the folder is a Xerox sheet, a reproduction of
          what appears to be an ancient document.
          
          It is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan.  And it is
          of the box seen from various angles.
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE
          
           - as she realizes what she is looking at.
          
                                     JOEY
                                  (softly)
                        Alright ...
          
          Joey turns, folder in hand, to look at the box on the floor and
          compare it to the diagram.
          
          Joey gasps.
          
          The miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears
          inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it.
          
          As if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud
          as the last particle of dust disappears into the box.
          
          Joey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand.
          The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts
          Terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit.
          
          Terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at Joey.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Joey ... ?
          
                                     JOEY
                               (still staring at Box)
                        Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think
                        the lady just made a sale.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   EARLY EVENING
          
          Joey is sitting behind a desk.  She has a phone in one hand and
          a pen in the other.
          
          Spread out over the desk are various documents - the photo of
          Kirsty, the diagram of the box, type-written transcripts etc -
          and a scratch-pad on which Joey has scrawled several numbers.
                                                                      36
          
          Joey is in mid-conversation on the phone.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... No, it's
                        important that I speak to ... What?  No,
                        don't ...          (a beat)       Put.
                        Me.  On.  Hold.  You.  Stupid.  Bitch.
          
          Joey slams the phone down.
          
          She stares at the papers, at the scratch pad, takes a deep
          breath, and punches out a number on the phone.
          
          This time Joey's voice is different.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Hi.  Now listen.  And listen good.  I'm
                        the Station Manager at W-QQY.  For the
                        last half-hour you've been dicking
                        around with my assistant.  Let me tell
                        you something.  With or without your co-
                        operation we are making this expose.  I
                        assume you're smart enough to guess
                        which version is going to make you look
                        good.  Now, if you can't put one hand on
                        that cassette and the other on a FedEx
                        man's butt within thirty seconds then
                        you damn well better put me through to
                        somebody who can.
          
          A pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end.
          
          Joey's voice transmogrifies again; now it's a seductive,
          persuasive purr.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Dr.  Fallon?  How nice of you to take my
                        call.  I understand you're in charge of
                        video archive from the Channard
                        Institute ... ?
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          Another night in Under The Underground
          
          Kids dance.
          
          Customers jostle at the bar.
          
          Couples neck in shadowed corners.
          
          Loud Metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various
          sculptures on the walls and ceiling.
          
                                                                      37
          
          The center of the dance-floor is packed.
          
          The pillar is missing.
          
          ANGLE ON BAR
          
          Sitting alone at a bar stool - though surrounded by tightly-
          packed customers - is SANDY, a very pretty teenage girl.  She
          is the same basic type as Terri; blonde, frail, young.  Too
          young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this.
          
          Sandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully
          enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it
          refilled.  She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but
          her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character.
          
          REVERSE ANGLE
          
          Sitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye-line confirming
          he is looking at Sandy, is JP Monroe.
          
          The bar-stool beside JP is occupied by a TEENAGE BOY who has
          his back to the bar and is talking to a GROUP of his FRIENDS.
          
          JP has a speculative, predatory look on his face.  Without
          shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the
          BARMAN is leaning over to hear his request.
          
          CLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her.  Laid
          alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose.
          
          Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight
          at the rose.  She raises her eyes and looks across the bar.
          
          JP returns the smile.
          
          He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard.
          
          The boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is
          speaking to him.  On recognizing JP, however, he vacates the
          seat without an argument and stands to join his friends.
          
          JP looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the empty
          stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face.
          
          Sandy gets up and, carrying the drink and the rose, makes her
          way across to sit beside JP.
          
          ANGLE ON JP AND SANDY
          
          The deafening music playing in the club means that they have to
          lean in close to hear each other speak.
          
                                     JP
                        Welcome.
                                                                      38
          
                                     SANDY
                        You're JP Monroe, right?
          
                                     JP
                        Uh-huh.
          
                                     SANDY
                        And this is your club.  Great club.  I
                        really love it here.  Great club.
          
                                     JP
                        Thank you.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Thank you for the drink.  And the rose.
                        Wow.  That's ... really nice.
          
                                     JP
                        It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
          
                                     SANDY
                        A prize?  For what?
          
                                     JP
                        You see, everyday I have my friend John
                        here bring ...
          
                                     SANDY
                        The barman?  I thought he was called
                        Rick?
          
                                     JP
                        He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind
                        if I continue?
          
                                     SANDY
                        I'm sorry.
          
                                     JP
                        Everyday I have my friend Rick here
                        bring a newly-cut red rose in with him
                        and keep it behind the bar.  And I award
                        it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here
                        who look better than ...
          
                                     JP
                        Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down.
                        If you have a quality, be proud of it...
          
          While talking, and without taking his eyes off Sandy, JP
          gestures at the barman and their glasses.
          
                                                                      39
          
                                     JP
                        ... Let it define you.  Whatever it is.
                        Most of the roses die behind the bar.
                        This is the first I've given out for
                        nearly a month.
          
                                     SANDY
                        No.  Really?
          
          Two full glasses join the still half-full ones on the bar.
          
                                     JP
                        Yes really.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Wow.  Thank you.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  Thank you.
          
          ANGLE ON GLASSES
          
          TIME-FADE
          
          ANGLE ON GLASSES
          
          Now there are six empty glasses on the bar and two half-full
          ones.
          
          ANGLE UP TO JP AND SANDY ...
          
           - except they're not there.  The two bar-stools are empty.
          
          
          INT.  JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT
          
          The music OFF from the club is dull and muffled.
          
          JP1s private room is the size - and shares the general
          appearance of - an expensive studio apartment.
          
          His room looks like an annex to his club - black walls, black
          fittings, artworks of elegant cruelty - show that JP's taste
          for the bizarre is not just professional.
          
          Camera explores the room as the sound of BREATHING grows OFF.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
           - now the right way up, it stands in a corner of the room.  As
          usual, it looks jarring and impressive but it doesn't really
          seem out of place in JP's room.
          
          The Breathing OFF becomes mixed with MOANS and SMALL CRIES.
          
                                                                      40
          
          ANGLE ON BED
          
          JP and Sandy, both naked, are on the bed making love.  Well,
          maybe Sandy's making love.  JP's having sex.
          
          It is a selfish, phallocentric scene, concentrating on JP's
          concern only for his own gratification.  It may be an erotic
          sight, but it's not a pretty one.
          
          JP is on top.  He has hold of both Sandy's wrists in one of his
          hands and his body is working away rhythmically.  He is half-
          upright, looking down at her.  No kissing.
          
          CLOSE on JP's face - his eyes open, staring down at Sandy.
          
          CLOSE on Sandy's face - her eyes closed, half in pleasure, half
          in shame.
          
          SMASH-CUT TO PILLAR
          
          CLOSE on Pinhead's face.  Suddenly, horribly, the monster's
          eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers.  A
          BLUE LIGHT seems to pulse from within the pillar, lending color
          to Pinhead's face.
          
          Pinhead continues to watch the love-making until it comes to a
          climax.
          
          As JP GROANS out his orgasm and collapses forward onto Sandy's
          body, Pinhead's eyes close.  The BLUE LIGHT disappears and the
          pillar is just the pillar again.
          
          
          INT.  MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON DESK
          
           - FAVORING the telephone/answering machine, its red message
          light blinking in the darkness of the apartment.
          
          Heard OFF is the sound of Joey coming in to her apartment -
          doors opening and closing, bags being put down, footsteps etc.
          
          Joey's hand comes into frame and presses the message button.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
           - as Joey waits for her machine and glances around the room
          for Terri.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri?
          
          ANGLE ON SOFA - JOEY'S POV
          
                                                                      41
          
          The sofa is empty.
          
          Joey looks puzzled and is about to call again when the machine
          kicks in.
          
                                     FALLON
                                    (on ansafone)
                        Ms.  Summerskill.  Joanne.  Hello.  This
                        is Dr. Fallon.  Martin.  Your reference
                        material is on its way to you.  I very
                        much enjoyed talking to you and I hope
                        that if I'm ever in town you'll do me
                        the honor of (sqwaaaaalk)
          
          Joey has her finger on the fast forward button.
          
                                     JOEY
                        In your dreams, pal.
          
          The chipmunk-squeal of Fallon's voice is replaced by the
          warning-beep of a second message.  Joey lets it play.
          
                                     WOMAN
                                 (on ansafone)
                         ... your number from your resume.
                        Which was very impressive, by the way.
                        My name is Sharon Leech and you can
                        reach me here at K-YZY in Monterey, area
                        code 805 ... (sqwaaalk)
          
          Joey stops the tape.
          
                                     JOEY
                                 (to herself)
                        Shit. Why now? Why not last week? Oh ...
          
          She glances round at the empty room again, troubled by Terri's
          absence.  She crosses to her bedroom door.
          
          
          INT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT
          
          Joey enters the darkened room - and then stops a few feet from
          the door.
          
          Terri - lit only by the moonlight through the blinds - is lying
          on one side of Joey's bed fast asleep.  Apart from her shoes,
          which she has kicked off, she is fully dressed.
          
          Joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend, her
          face sympathetic, affectionate, and troubled.
          
          Joey reaches over, takes one of the pillows from the other side
          of the bed, and lays it at the bottom end.
          
                                                                      42
          
          She slips off her shoes, shrugs off her jacket, and -
          delicately, carefully - climbs on to the other side of the bed,
          laying her head on the pillow she had moved.
          
                                     JOEY
                                  (whispered)
                        Goodnight, Terri ...
          
          
          INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT
          
          JP, on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post-coital cigarette,
          blows smoke-rings at the ceiling and all but ignores Sandy.
          
          Sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering
          around the room, admiring it and chattering.
          
                                     SANDY
                        So cool ...
          
          She approaches the pillar ... leans in close ... closer ... and
          ... nothing happens.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Radical.
          
          She walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls.
          
          ANGLE ON PAINTING
          
          It's a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece.  The
          kind of crap you'd buy in a Melrose gallery.
          
          Perhaps it's called Biker Crucifixion.  Night-time, somewhere
          rural. A Hell's Angel, arms outstretched and stripped to the
          waist, is tied to a tree by cruelly-tight barbed wire wrapped
          around his body.  At the foot of the tree his biker friends
          party, drink, and fuck, Harleys parked in the distance.  The
          crucified Angel's eyes are raised to the Moon.  He's smiling.
          
          WIDER ANGLE ON SANDY AND PAINTING
          
                                     SANDY
                        Wow.  You've got great taste.  This ...
                        well ... this really says it, you know?
                        It's really ... dark.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          Still staring at the ceiling, JP pulls a pained face - like
          he's heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Don't you think?
          
                                                                      43
          
                                     JP
                        Mmn-hmnn.
          
          Sandy turns to look at JP, troubled by his unresponsiveness.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
          
                                     JP
                        Unh-unh.
          
          A beat.  Sandy stares at JP.  JP stares at the ceiling.
          
                                     SANDY
                        If it bothers you, just say so.
          
          JP sighs.
          
                                     JP
                        It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not
                        interested.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
          
          JP blows a smoke ring at the ceiling.
          
          Sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the
          bed.  ( And yes, fright fans, this does put her in front of the
          pillar - though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract
          audience attention.)
          
                                     SANDY
                        But you gave me a rose ...
          
                                     JP
                        And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody
                        else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
          
                                     SANDY
                        You shit.  Who do you think you are?
          
                                     JP
                        I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch.
                        Now get the fuck out of my life.
          
                                     SANDY
                        You ... I can't fucking believe you, you
                        bastard!  You get me in here ...
          
                                     JP
                        Right.  Like you were hog-tied or
                        something.
          
          
                                                                      44
          
                                     SANDY
                        Look at you!  You think you're some God
                        damn Prince or something.  With your
                        shitty little Kingdom out there and all
                        this ugly shi ....
          
          Sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and, halfway
          through her last line, has turned to indicate the pillar.
          
          Suddenly - BAM! BIG SCARE MOMENT! - two blackened arms fly out
          from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms.
          
          The BLUE LIGHT burns from within, illuminating Pinhead's face
          as his eyes open, filled with demonic glee and hunger.
          
          An impossible WIND begins to whistle through the room, as if an
          echoed glimpse of a storm in Hell.
          
          Sandy screams in mortal terror.
          
          JP jumps from the bed, cigarette falling to the floor.  He
          backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless.
          
                                     JP
                        Jesus Christ!
          
          Pinhead smiles sardonically.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Not quite.
          
          Pinhead's arms pull Sandy tight against the pillar and his
          face, stifling her scream.
          
          JP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy,
          held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death:
          
          Sandy's life-force is sucked from her.  Drawn into the pillar.
          Into Pinhead.
          
          It is a matter of seconds only but, in those few seconds -
          
          Her body begins to collapse in on itself, turning grey and
          lifeless.  It is made worse by the fact that until the very end
          Sandy keeps struggling, writhing in the grasp of the monster.
          
          The wind keeps blowing through the room.
          
          Finally, a dry lifeless husk, she is dropped to the floor.
          
          The Blue Light fades from within the pillar. The wind
          disappears.
          
          
          
                                                                      45
          
          The pillar is again black and stationary.  But its contours are
          different, more rounded.  It looks more organic, as if shifting
          its raw material into new alignments, new configurations.  The
          pillar seems to be in a process of becoming.  And the obvious
          suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead.
          
          Pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar.
          They are not completely free and - now that the "eating" of
          Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement but
          there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before.
          
          Even though the blue light has faded, Pinhead's face is
          noticeably different.  It is blue-tinged and more fleshy in
          appearance.  Capable of movement.  And speech.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - who has sunk to the floor, staring at the pillar.
          
                                     JP
                        What ... What ... ?
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        What did you see?  The same as I.
                        Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You
                        saw the working of the world in
                        miniature.
          
          JP shakes his head in denial.  But he's already a little more
          together than he was: after all, the pillar can't move and he's
          several yards from it.
          
                                     JP
                        That had nothing to do with the world.
                        Not this one, anyway.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        On the contrary.  It has everything to
                        do with the world.  And our dreams of
                        how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed
                        the girl?
          
                                     JP
                        Yes.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
          
                                     JP
                        No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... 
                        No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
          
          Pinhead laughs.
                                                                      46
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        How uncomfortable that word must feel on
                        your lips.  Evil.  Good.  There is no
                        Good, Monroe.  There is no Evil.  There
                        is only the flesh and the patterns to
                        which we can submit it.  You will help
                        me to ...
          
          JP shakes his head in furious denial.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  No no no.  No fuckin' way.  I'm
                        gone ...
          
          Grabbing at his jeans, JP heads out of his room.  Rapidly.
          
          
          EXT.   CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB   NEXT DAY
          
          The sun is high.  It's about noon.
          
          Like most clubs of its type, Under The Underground's exterior
          is far from prepossessing.  It's set in an old brick warehouse
          in a run-down section of town.
          
          JP's Range Rover pulls up and JP gets out, carrying a long slim
          black bag.  He glances round the all-but-deserted street and
          enters the club.
          
          
          INT.  JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   DAY
          
          CLOSE on Pinhead's face; in repose, back to its statue-like
          state.
          
          The sound of the door OFF opens the monster's eyes.
          
          JP enters, closing the door behind him.
          
          He doesn't look at the pillar.  He stays by the door and keeps
          his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him.
          
          He unzips it.  His manner is that of a man who has made a
          decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                               (off)
                        Another offering?
          
          JP doesn't respond.  He draws a double-barrelled shotgun from
          the bag, cocks it, and loads it.
          
          JP turns to face the pillar, drawing a bead on Pinhead.
          
          Pinhead's expression is wearily amused.
                                                                      47
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I'm touched ... That is the gun you used
                        to kill your parents?
          
          JP visibly staggers as Pinhead lets slip this knowledge.
          
          Pinhead smiles.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I understand.  Their fortune was so
                        tempting, their affection so
                        conditional.  What else could you do?
          
                                     JP
                        Fuck you!
          
          He pulls the double trigger.
          
          A massive BLAST resounds around the room but that's about it;
          the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Thank you.  Now, shall we talk sensibly?
          
          JP lets the useless gun fall from his hand.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a
                        quality, let it define you.  Cultivate
                        it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will
                        help yourse...
          
                                     JP
                        What!?  What are you talking about?  Why
                        should I help you?
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Because you want to.  You've always
                        wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look
                        at your sculptures.  Look at those
                        tawdry representations and then ...
                        Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as
                        canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will
                        and mine as the brush and the knife.
                        Oh, I have such sights to show you.
          
          It's working.  JP's eyes are glittering with excited interest.
          
                                     JP

          INT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON MONITORS
          
          Many screens fill the frame, all of them crackling with snow.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          Joey is alone at the control desk.  She has a video tape in her
          hand and feeds it into the master machine.
          
          She looks up at the still-ghosting monitors and then presses a
          few buttons on the console.
          
          The snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time
          code ticking away at the bottom of each screen.
          
                                     JOEY
                               (softly)
                        Alright ... Let's see what we got here.
                                                                      49
          
          The blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of
          KIRSTY, the girl in the picture in the antique store.
          
          The video image is primitive, shot with a non-professional
          camcorder, and is a simple medium long-shot of Kirsty, dressed
          in a simple white smock, sitting in a hospital room.
          
          Kirsty addresses the camera directly, though occasionally looks
          up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor.
          
          INTERCUT through Kirsty's monologue between: A single monitor
          image, the wall of monitors, and the watching and listening
          Joey.

                        I don't know what the Box is.  But I
                        know what it does.  I ...    (looks up
                        to side)     I've said all this before.
                        Do you ...    (blinks, nods, as if
                        listening.  Looks back to camera)  I saw
                        it open.  I opened it.  I saw what came
                        out.  I don't know what else to call
                        them.  Demons.  Demons live in the box.
                        Or come through the box from somewhere
                        else.  It's a gateway to Hell.  Or the
                        South Bronx.     (smiles ruefully at her
                        own joke.  Looks up to side as if
                        chastised for kidding around.  Nods.
                        Continues)     I know you don't believe
                        me.  I know what it sounds like.  But
                        what else ... Jesus, talk to Ronson,
                        talk to the other cops.  They saw the
                        house.  They saw my ... my father ...
          
          Kirsty breaks down into sobs.
          
          QUICK-CUT TO JOEY
          
           - whose expression shows distressed sympathy.  She too has
          lost her father.
          
          ANGLE ON MONITORS
          
          The video image breaks up into white noise and then comes back
          in, as if the camcorder was turned off for a few moments.
          
          When the image returns, Kirsty is smoking a cigarette to help
          calm her.
          
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                      50

                        Solving the puzzle means opening the
                        box.  Opening the box means opening
                        doors.  And there are some doors you
                        don't want to open.  And it may be
                        metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you
                        haven't had some blue-faced bastard come
                        at you with hooks and chains.  It isn't
                        delusion, it isn't psychosis.  It's
                        reality.  It's reality.     (Pause.
                        Long drag on the cigarette?)   Maybe not
                        this reality ... but there are others.
                        I've seen them.
          
          Joey's face shows horrified fascination at Kirsty's story.
          There is a conviction in the telling which is working on Joey.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          The room is dimly-lit.
          
          ANGLE ON FLOOR BY TV SET
          
          The floor is littered with video-boxes and tapes.  Other tapes
          are piled on top of the VCR.  It's like somebody has been
          viewing constantly for a week and hasn't put anything away.
          
          ANGLE ON SOFA AND COFFEE TABLE
          
          Many books are lying on the sofa, the table, and the floor.
          Some are lying open, most are closed.
          
          Also on the coffee table are three different soft-drink cans, a
          half- empty cup of coffee, and a very full ash-tray.
          
          ANGLE ON BOOKSHELFS
          
          Terri is standing by the bookshelfs, running her eyes and her
          finger along some titles.
          
          Now we understand the chaos in the room.  Terri's home alone.
          She's bored and trying to find something to hold her interest.
          
          She looks away from the shelves and walks idly over to the TV.
          
          The Box is back on top of the TV.  Terri's hand hovers near the
          on/off switch of the TV.  Then it hesitates and picks up the
          box instead.  Terri holds the box and looks at it.  Her face
          becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick on a LIGHT.
          She wanders back to the TV looking at the box.
          
          
          
                                                                      51
          
          It looks different.  Its edges are more sharply defined.  The
          shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller, smoother.
          The detailed metal-work has some color back and is shining.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Jeez, Joey musta polished you up some.
                        Sometimes I think she's wierder than me.
          
          Terri's voice trails off as she continues to look at the box.
          She turns it in her hands, running her fingers over its
          filigree surfaces.
          
          TRACK in slowly as she cups it in both hands, her eyes moving
          from puzzlement to fascination and concentration.
          
          She rubs her thumbs over the designs.  TRACKING IN continues.
          It's tense.  Is she going to try and work the puzzle?
          
          Suddenly .... BRRRRRRRRR ... the phone rings.
          
          Terri jumps in shock, nearly dropping the box.
          
          She puts the box back on top of the TV and crosses to the
          phone.  She picks it up.

          She looks around.  She looks at the books.  She looks at the
          videos.  She looks at the table.  She looks back at the phone.

                        Hi.  You've reached Joanne Summerskill.
                        In spirit at least.  Please leave a

                               (on phone)
                        Hello.  Ms. Summerskill, this is Sharon
                        Leech again from K-YZY in Monterey.
                        Sorry to call so late but I was
                        wondering if you got my other message?
                        Look, I probably shouldn't say this on
                        tape but what the hell ... there's a job
                        here if you want it.  Late-night news
                        reader.  We think you'd be marvelous ..
          
          The machine BEEPS and cuts her off, leaving the message light
          FLASHING.
          
          CLOSE on Terri's face - disappointed and sad.
          
          
          INT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   NIGHT
          
          Joey is still at the desk watching the bank of monitors.
          
          As Kirsty speaks, INTERCUT between Joey and the monitors.
          
                                     KIRSTY
                        (Looks to side)  Again?  (Shrugs. Looks
                        back at camera)  The box.  I don't know
                        where it came from.  I don't know who
                        made it or why.  I only know what it
                        does.  It hurts.  It hurts.   (Looks off
                        to side as if listening.)  How?  (Looks
                        back)  I don't know.  It kind of opens
                        itself.  Your fingers move.  You learn.
                        It wants to open, that's the thing.  And
                        it knows when you want to open it.  And
                        it helps.  And it opens.  And then they
                        come.  The Cenobites.  The demons.
          
          ANGLE ON WALL OF MONITORS
          
          Multiple images of Kirsty speaking those last few lines.
          
          Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE
          NOISE WIPE-OUT.
          
          Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then
          freezes in shock.
          
          ANGLE ON MONITORS
          
           - as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears:
          
          A hazy, black-and-white image (very grainy, like early
          experimental TV images) of a thirtysomething man in early
          twentieth century military uniform.
          
                                                                      55
          
          The man - ELLIOTT - stares directly out of the monitor screen
          and, just as Kirsty finishes her last line ("The cenobites. The
          demons."), he speaks (in an English accent).
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                                   (on monitor)
                        She's telling the truth, Joey.
          
          Another BURST of WHITE NOISE and the image is gone.
          
          Kirsty is back on that monitor, just like all the others.
          
                                     KIRSTY
                        Look, you can have me tell this ...
          
          Joey remains staring at the haunted monitor, numb with shock.
          What the hell is going on?
          
          Kirsty's voice plays OFF as Joey stares.
          
                                     KIRSTY
                        ...  as often as you want.  There's not
                        going to be any breakthrough.  You might
                        think it's delusion, but it's not.  I
                        saw them.  I looked into their eyes and
                        they looked back at me.  Creatures from
                        Hell.
          
          
          INT.   24-HOUR DINER   NIGHT
          
          A late-night coffee-shop in the early hours of the morning.
          Classic American Diner.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES
          
          Empty booths.
          
          A quiet counter.  A COP perches on a stool drinking coffee.
          
          A TRUCKER in a booth by himself bites methodically on a donut,
          his eyes staring off into the vacancy of the night.
          
          In a corner booth, FOUR KIDS nurse cokes and smoke cigarettes.
          
          ANGLE ON TABLE
          
          A black coffee sits by an ash-tray holding a burning cigarette.
          
          REVEAL TERRI
          
           - sitting at the table staring at the coffee.
          
          She waits.  She takes a drag on the smoke.  She waits.  She
          sips her coffee.  She waits.  She looks up across the diner.
                                                                      56
          
          TERRI'S POV
          
          The double doors of the diner's entrance.
          
          ANGLE ON TERRI
          
          She looks back down at her coffee.
          
          The sound of doors opening OFF.  Terri looks up again.
          
          ANGLE FROM DOORS - TERRI IN DISTANCE
          
          A WALKING POV as somebody approaches Terri, whose face breaks
          into a nervous, ambiguous smile of welcome.
          
          REVERSE ANGLE - TERRI'S POV
          
           - as JP walks confidently to her table, smiling.
          
                                     JP
                        Hey, babe.  Thanks for coming.
          
          JP sits down opposite her.  He reaches over and pats her hand.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          Joey enters the unlit main room.  She glances across at the
          sofa.  It's unoccupied.  Joey puts the light on.
          
          She grimaces at the chaos of the room - the piles of videos and
          books - and crosses the room to the bedroom door.  She opens
          the door and looks in.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri, we can't bunk up every night!
                        People will ...
          
          The bedroom is empty, nobody on the bed.
          
                                     JOEY
                                    (off)
                        ... talk.  ... Terri?
          
          Joey leaves the door and walks back into the main room.
          
          She looks around and then walks over to the phone.  Something
          has caught her eye.
          
          ANGLE BY PHONE
          
          A hand-scrawled note by the phone reads ENJOY MONTEREY, YOU
          LIAR.
          
          JOEY registers the note.
                                                                      57
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh shit.
          
          Joey shakes her head sadly.  What can she do?  It's the early
          hours of the morning.  She has no idea where Terri is.  She
          walks back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her.
          
          
          EXT.   DENSE JUNGLE   DAY     (JOEY'S DREAM)
          
          Thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a POV camera.
          
          The sounds of confused battle are heard OFF; helicopters, gun-
          fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded
          
          Leaves and branches SMACK against the frame as the unseen
          dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest.
          
          The voices of the Soldiers - distant, echoed, repeated - are
          heard over the roar of battle.
          
                                     SOLDIER 1
                                        (off)
                        He's going.  He's going.  He's going ...
          
                                     SOLDIER 2
                                        (off)
                        We're losing him.  We're losing him.
                        We're losing him ...
          
          The sound of their voices seems to prompt the POV camera to
          more furious endeavor.
          
          It turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the
          greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage
          thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely.
          
          
          EXT.  FLANDERS FIELD (WW I)   DAY      (JOEY'S DREAM)
          
          The POV camera (Joey) walks out into another battlefield, one
          of a different character.
          
          It appears to be early morning.  The skies are grey and
          overcast.  In the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward
          
          No jungle, no trees or grass.  The ground is baked mud
          disfigured with deep trenches, re-inforced by wooden slats.
          
          The atmosphere is post-conflict; guns are silent, there are no
          cries or sound of machinery.
          
          Scattered around are corpses of many khaki-clad soldiers.
          
          
                                                                      58
          
          Nothing moves.  No birds sing.  It is a horrible, desolate
          image from the bloody pages of history.  The fields of Flanders
          in World War One.
          
          A noise begins to be heard OFF.  A low angry BUZZING.
          
          ANGLE ON DEAD SOLDIER
          
          A cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor
          dead face.
          
                                     JOEY
                                     (off)
                        Noooooooooo .......
          
          The buzzing and Joey's anguished cry both CONTINUE OVER as we
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          INT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT
          
          Joey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Nooooooooooo!
          
          The cry cuts off abruptly as Joey realizes where she is.
          
          She catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that
          the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom.
          Are the flies still feeding?  She glances around her room.
          
          ANGLE ON BEDROOM TV - JOEY'S POV
          
          Her TV set is on.  The buzzing sound comes from white noise.
          
          Joey is puzzled and scared.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Is somebody here?  Is somebody here!?
                        Terri ... ?
          
          She half gets out of bed and then stops, transfixed, as the TV
          screen's white noise is replaced by an image.
          
          ANGLE ON TV
          
          As in the editing suite, the image is grainy black-and-white.
          
          The buzzing continues, now joined by HISSING and WHISTLING that
          fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an
          impossibly distant station.
          
          
                                                                      59
          
          Somewhere in the sound-montage we can almost hear GHOSTLY
          VOICES whispering; "Joey, Joey, Joey ... "
          
          On the screen, an English Officer - Elliott - is sitting cross-
          legged on the floor of a Quonset hut.
          
          On the floor in front of him is something at which he stares -
          something that the image is not sharp enough to show.
          
          WIDER ANGLE - JOEY AND TV
          
          Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What ... What's going on?  What's
                        happening?
          
          ANGLE ON TV
          
          The image disappears in a burst of STATIC which in turn is
          replaced by another image, still monochrome and grainy; A head-
          and-shoulders of Elliott, staring directly out of the screen.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        You have to help me, Joey.
          
          A burst of STATIC and the image disappears completely. The TV
          is obviously not turned on.  The room is silent.
          
          Joey stares at her dead TV in numbed silence.
          
          She falls back into bed, pulling the covers protectively around
          her, staring at the ceiling.
          
          
          INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT
          
          BLACKNESS
          
          A CLICK is heard OFF and the room is lit, REVEALING JP by the
          door, his finger by the light-switch.  He smiles into the room
          and walks in, looking behind as Terri hesitates by the door.
          
                                     JP
                        Come on in.
          
          Terri moves past him.
          
          JP locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket.
          
          Terri registers this.  JP calms her.

                        Not a good neighborhood.  People
                        disappear.  (a beat)  Feel like home?
                        It's just like you left it.
          
          Terri moves into the room, glancing around herself cautiously.
          She registers the pillar.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
          It's plainly different from the last time Terri saw it but -
          despite what the audience knows about it - it still seems
          inanimate; a black frozen carving, disturbing but harmless.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Not quite.  This wasn't here.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  But, as you can see, I'm having
                        some work done on it.  You found a real
                        treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can
                        show you how grateful I am.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
          
                                     JP
                        Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it
                        up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        A girl?  Anyone I should know?
          
                                     JP
                        Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're
                        here, it's like she doesn't even exist,
                        you know what I mean?
          
          JP has been cruising the room as they speak.  Now he's standing
          close to the pillar.  Terri is still some distance from him.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah right.  Look ...
          
                                     JP
                        Terri, listen.    (a beat)   Why don't
                        you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's
                        probably ticking away in both our minds,
                        right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it
                        going to happen?  Let's get it out of
                        the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can
                        relax.  Talk.  You know.
          
          
          
                                                                      61
          
          A pause - a tense one for the audience who know that JP has
          obviously decided who Pinhead's next meal is.  Terri looks at
          JP, half suspicious, half attracted.
          
                                     TERRI
                        I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not
                        ready yet.
          
                                     JP
                        Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool.
                        I mean, we've got all night.
          
          JP smiles winningly and warmly.  A nice guy.  A nice smile.  A
          smile a girl can trust.
          
          The pillar stands behind him, its dark inhabitant still and
          silent, waiting for the sacrifice.
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          Series of shots (maybe all CROSS-FADED) of kids dancing and
          drinking in the club to establish the passing of time - and to
          highlight the tension of the scene in JP's room by its
          proximity to this (relative) normality.
          
          
          INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT    (MINUTES LATER)
          
          JP lounges against his wall, smoking, close to the pillar.
          
          Terri is sitting on the bed.  She's upset.  She's been telling
          JP about Joey and the phone message.
          
                                     JP
                        That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was
                        obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready
                        to dump you the second she had what she
                        needed, interfering little whore.
          
                                     TERRI
                        No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's
                        like I must have done something wrong,
                        you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked
                        up something good again.
          
                                     JP
                        Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You
                        know that.  It was my fault, babe, it
                        really was.  And you know I'm sorry.
                        And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I
                        hate to see you in pain like this.
          
          Terri looks up at him, her eyes vulnerable, on the verge of
          tears.  She really wants to believe that he's being a nice guy.
                                                                      62
          
                                     TERRI
                        Really?
          
                                     JP
                        Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to
                        hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's
                        alright.
          
          God, the bastard's good at this.  Terri breaks into small sobs
          and holds her arms out for him.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  No, sweetheart, you come to me.
                        It's not fair.  I come over there.  You
                        know.  We're on the bed.  I just ...
                        'cos you know how much you excite me.
                        God, just looking at you.  You're so
                        beautiful.  I come over there and I'd
                        just want to touch you.  Feel you.  Kiss
                        you.  And that isn't what this is about.
                        C'mon, babe, come to daddy.  Let me make
                        it better.
          
          Terri wipes her eyes, gives a small shy smile and stands up.
          
          She's walking toward JP.  And the pillar.
          
          JP puts a hand out.  He smiles.  Re-assuring.  Loving.
          
          Terri walks.  Vulnerable.  So in need of reassurance and love.
          
          WIDER ANGLE -JP, TERRI, PILLAR
          
          She's getting closer ... closer ... closer ...
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he blows it.  A sidelong glance at the pillar?  A sudden
          naked hunger in the smiling eyes?  A single bead of sweat?
          Some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game.
          
          Terri stops dead.  She doesn't know what's happening but
          suddenly this doesn't feel right.
          
                                     TERRI
                        No ... Wait a ...
          
          EVERYTHING ERUPTS!
          
          JP, smiling mask wiped off, leaps at Terri.
          
          Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear.
          
          Pinhead: suddenly animate and furious; eyes wide open, face
          contorted in frustrated rage, black arms clawing at the air.
                                                                      63
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Bring her to me, boy!
          
          A furious, confused scene of tension and struggle.
          
          JP has hold of Terri, trying to drag her to the monster.
          
          Terri fights back, screaming her disbelief and struggling and
          kicking against him.  They are perilously close to the pillar.
          
          Pinhead is furious - roaring, tearing at the pillar with his
          hands as if trying to physically rip himself. free of it.
          
          Slowly, JP's size and strength is telling; Terri is being
          dragged nearer and nearer to the demon.
          
          At the last possible second - when it seems it's all over, when
          Pinhead's snatching fingers are centimeters from Terri's flesh
          - Terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by the pillar
          and smashes JP right across the head with it.
          
          JP collapses semi-conscious at the foot of the pillar.
          
          Terri throws herself back from the monster's grabbing arms.
          
          Pinhead snarls in frustration, hands clenched in fists of rage.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
          Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and
          breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this
          creature from nightmare.
          
          And suddenly Pinhead changes tack; he slides from the roaring
          beast of a moment before to his more usual persona - the glib,
          articulate Black Pope of Hell.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Wait!  Why run?  Where to?  Do you know
                        where you are?
          
                                     TERRI
                        I'm ... I'm ...
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You're at the door of dreams.  And you
                        can open it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        What are you talking about?
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                      64
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        There are two keys in this room.  On is
                        in the pocket of this fool.  You could
                        take it out without me reaching you. (a
                        beat)  Probably.  And you could use it
                        to let yourself back in to the world you
                        know.  The world you've always known;
                        banal, hopeless, dreamless.
          
          Pinhead, as ever, is hitting the right buttons.  Terri, as we
          know, has dreamed of dreaming.
          
                                     TERRI
                        And ... like ... the other?
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        The other is the key to dreams.  To a
                        world of black miracles and dark wonder.
                        Another life of unknown pleasures.  It's
                        yours.  Complete the pattern.  Solve the
                        puzzle.  Turn the key.
          
          ANGLE ON TERRI
          
           - as she looks at the monster.  And smiles.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Where is it?
          
          Pinhead returns the smile.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        It's lying bleeding at your feet.
          
          JP is on the floor, semi-conscious, bleeding from the head.
          
                                     JP
                               (delerious. Ad-lib)
                        Unhhh ... Terri ... what ... no ...
          
          Terri edges around the pillar to grasp one of JP's limp arms.
          
          INTERCUT CLOSE-UPS OF PINHEAD AND TERRI
          
           - as the bond between tempter and tempted is strengthened.
          
          Terri holds JP's arm out ...
          
          Pinhead stretches his own arm forward ...
          
          And JP finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity -
          realizes what's happening.
          
          
          
                                                                      65
          
                                     JP
                                (screaming)
                        No! Terri! Please! I didn't mean to..!!
          
          Too late.  Pinhead's hand closes around his wrist.
          
          Terri leaps back out of harm's way.
          
          Pinhead - with awesome strength - yanks JP up to his feet and
          pulls him close.  He stares into the terrified face of JP.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I have such sights to show you.
          
          JP is sucked dry by Pinhead.
          
          And Terri watches, her face perversely excited by this - the
          first of the dark miracles that the monster had promised.
          
          MAJOR F/X SEQUENCE
          
           - as the transformation of pillar into Pinhead is completed.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
          Pinhead, fully-fleshed and incarnate, stands in the room.  At
          his feet are the dry husk that was JP and the steaming, hissing
          remnants of the pillar like a pool of black toxic oil.
          
          He turns and looks at Terri.  Slowly, elegantly, he walks
          toward her.
          
          Terri backs away across the room.  But she backs off slowly,
          sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for
          her groom.
          
          Camera moves in CLOSE on her glowing eyes and excited face.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on the Box.  A cloud of dust spirals out into the room in
          a reverse action of the dust in the antiques store.
          
          
          INT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on Joey's sleeping face.  REM shows beneath her eyelids
          and she murmurs in her sleep.
          
          Very faintly OFF is the sound of distant music.
          
          Joey's eyes snap open and glance from side to side.  She sits
          up in bed and registers the music, which seems to have grown in
          volume on her waking.
                                                                      66
          
          It is strange, old-fashioned music;  A palm-court string
          orchestra playing a sentimental waltz tune reminiscent of the
          1920's or earlier.
          
          Joey looks around the room.
          
          There is no-one in the room.
          
          The TV set is still dead.
          
          But ... the bedroom door is open a crack and a very strange DIM
          ORANGE LIGHT is creeping in from the main room.  And that seems
          to be from where the music is coming.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she gets out of bed.
          
          She's cautious and careful, moving slowly and quietly as she
          wraps a robe around herself and moves to the door.
          
          The music continues to play.
          
          She opens the door slowly and walks through.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          This room too is empty.
          
          The music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light
          is more distinct, bathing the walls and the furniture.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES - JOEY'S POV
          
           - as Joey tries to locate the source of the music and the
          light;
          
          The sofa.
          
          The bookshelfs.
          
          The TV - with the still and inactive Box.
          
          The closed drapes over the big picture window.
          
          Finally -
          
          ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR
          
          Both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet
          door across the room.  They're both coming from behind it.
          
          Joey approaches the closet, still tense, still careful.  She
          opens the closet door and looks in.
                                                                      67
          
          The closet is where Joey has stored her past.  But she's stored
          it neatly.
          
          Boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines, old greetings
          cards, old photographs, old soft-toys, college diplomas,
          clippings from small-town newspapers ("Death of a Local Hero:
          Tommy Summerskill lost in Vietnam", "Joanne Summerskill Class
          Valedictorian: looks to career in Media") etc etc.
          
          Also in there, stuffed away at the top of the closet, is an old
          radio - a big old wood-and-wire-grille valve driven beauty from
          which the lilting music is coming.
          
          At some stage in its life, part of its casing was smashed away
          and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes.
          
          It's an old mains-powered model and its mains cord dangles off
          the shelf of the closet.  This radio isn't plugged into
          anything except the paranormal.
          
          CLOSE on Joey; staring at this broadcast from the beyond.
          
                                     JOEY
                        How .... ?
          
          Joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and
          out into the main room.  She sets it down on the coffee table
          in front of the sofa.
          
          DIFFERENT ANGLE
          
          Formal, classical framing from a low angle - Joey and radio in
          foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the
          background.
          
          Joey kneels up in front of the table.
          
          She stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped
          fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous
          HELLRAISER movies stare at the Box.
          
          Her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle.
          She plays with the dial, moving through various "stations".
          
          Joey's face is open with expectation as she moves through them,
          as if she is waiting for clues.  Or instructions.
          
          The music gives way to various VOICES;
          
          An Indian voice giving some kind of commentary.  The English
          words "BBC" and "World Service" are heard amidst the punjabi.
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          A tired sad English voice;
                                                                      68
          
                                     ENGLISH VOICE
                               ... and the King has sent a
                        personal message of sympathy to the
                        parents of those brave men who ...
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          A resonant French voice;
          
                                     FRENCH VOICE
                        L'Oiseau chante avec ses doigts.  Deux
                        fois.
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          Another burst of music, this time more raucous and syncopated.
          A ragtime tune from the birth of Jazz.
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          Dead Air.  An ominous pause.  And Elliott's voice.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey.  Look out your window.
          
          Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
          
          The radio goes dead.  The tubes stop glowing.  The room is now
          a dimly-lit place of shadow and suspense.
          
          Joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and
          then at the silent radio.
          
          She stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes.  The camera
          rises and TRACKS in as she walks, framing those drapes like
          curtains in a theater.
          
          With one strong gesture, Joey sweeps the drapes open.  And
          gasps.
          
          Instead of neighboring roof-tops and a view of the city, Joey
          is looking directly into the interior of a Quonset hut.
          
          It is the image from her TV set though full-size, full-color,
          and apparently real.
          
          At the far end, Elliott sits cross-legged on the floor.  In
          front of him on the floor is the puzzle box.
          
          Elsewhere in the hut; A camp-bed on which lie a gun-belt and an
          Officer's peaked cap.  And an old-fashioned radio - the same
          radio that is still in Joey's room.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
                                                                      69
          
           - as she stares beyond her window into this impossible scene.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Tell me ... Tell me ... Hello?
          
          CLOSER on the elements in the hut, as we (and Joey) realize
          that everything in there is frozen in time.  There is no
          movement, no sound.
          
          Wonderingly (but carefully) Joey stretches her arm out before
          her.  When her arm reaches the threshold of the Quonset hut, it
          disappears into the space once occupied by window glass.
          
          She pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath.  Maybe
          she even takes a half-step backward.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I'm seven floors up ... I'm seven floors
                        up! I can't ...
          
          But she can.
          
          She summons her courage, steps over the sill, and walks into
          the impossible.
          
          
          INT.   QUONSET HUT
          
          We are looking at a solid wall.  Then, through the wall, Joey
          walks into the Hut, still bewilderment by the sights around
          her.
          
          Still the image does not move.  Everything is very real, very
          present.  But frozen.
          
          Joey approaches the immobile Elliott and looks from him to the
          box and back again.
          
          (NB: Joey's speeches to the frozen Elliott are bravado; her
          face and body language betray her awed nervousness at the
          bizarre situation in which she finds herself.)
          
                                     JOEY
                        Now what?  I'm here.  Now what?  I just
                        walked into madness for you.  Talk!
          
          Joey looks back behind her.
          
          ANGLE ON HUT WALL - JOEY'S POV
          
          There is no window back into the apartment, just a fourth wall.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY AND ELLIOTT
          
          
                                                                      70
          
                                     JOEY
                        Great.  That's just great!  You bring me
                        here.  You freeze up on me.  And now
                        there's no way out.  I've had dates like
                        you before.  I ...
          
          A CREAK is heard OFF.  Joey looks up.
          
          JOEY'S POV
          
          At the far end of the Quonset Hut, behind Elliott, a door has
          creaked open an inch or two.
          
          Joey looks from the door back to the frozen Elliott.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Thanks.  I think.
          
          Joey crosses to the door and opens it.  She walks through.
          
          
          EXT.   FLANDERS FIELD   DAY
          
          Joey walks out onto the World War One battlefield of her most
          recent dream.  She stands there - an incongruous vulnerable
          figure in her nightdress and robe - amidst the corpses, the
          trenches, and the distant plumes of smoke.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What's going on?  Is this a dream?
          
          She glances back at the door of the hut she has just left.
          
          JOEY'S POV - THROUGH HUT DOOR
          
          Within the hut, the frozen Elliott still sits.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes
          wide in shock.
          
          Standing on a hillock, framed against the grey battlefield
          skies, is Elliott.
          
          Joey walks toward him.
          
          Elliott stands calmly and smiles at Joey.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey.  How kind of you to come.
          
          A beat.  Joey (and the audience) take in Elliott's impossible
          presence, as she and he stand amidst the corpse-strewn field.
          
                                                                      71
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help
                        me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming
                        this?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        You have to help me.  You will
                        understand.  And no, you're not
                        dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
          
                                     JOEY
                        It's ... I don't know.  First World War,
                        right?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Correct.  The fields of France.  And
                        many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me.
                        My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser.
                        Captain.
          
          He extends his hand.
          
          Joey - slowly and nervously - puts her hand out to shake his.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Joey Summerskill.
          
          Elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably
                        never shaken hands with a ghost before,
                        am I right?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What
                        the Hell is going on?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Hell is precisely what is going on,
                        Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I
                        because of a special obligation, you
                        because you're the only person who can
                        help. And because you know what is
                        right, and just, and true.  Will you
                        walk with me a while?
          
          He gestures with his hand and they begin to walk.
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                      72
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        There were days in this war, days right
                        on top of each other, when the newly
                        dead were numbered in the tens of
                        thousands.  They called it the war to
                        end all wars.  Though it didn't.  You
                        know that.  There were more wars.  More
                        dead.  Your father's war.  Your dream
                        search for your father led you here.  To
                        me.  Joey, we need to talk.
          
          Elliott does nothing dramatic - he doesn't clap his hands or
          snap his fingers - but somehow, magically, he and Joey, without
          moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut.
          
          
          INT.   QUONSET HUT
          
          The frozen Elliott is still sitting on the floor before the
          box.  The mobile Elliott gestures at his frozen self as he
          speaks to the bemused Joey.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        The war pulled poetry out of some of us.
                        Others it affected differently.  This is
                        me a few years later.  We're in India,
                        by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like
                        many survivors. Lost souls with nothing
                        left to believe in but gratification.
                        We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many
                        dead.  For us God, too, fell at
                        Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And
                        if we mourned, we mourned in silence.
                        Thousands drank themselves to death.
                        Others went further.  I went further.  I
                        thought I was a lost soul.  But, until
                        this frozen moment, I didn't even know
                        what the phrase meant.
          
                                     JOEY
                        And what is ... this frozen moment?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I
                        am, what I will be ... past, present,
                        future, all bound here at this timeless
                        moment of decision.  I was an explorer
                        of forbidden vices and pleasures.
                        Opening the Box was my final act of
                        exploration, of discovery.
          
                                     JOEY
                        And what did you discover?
          
          
                                                                      73
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Something bad.
          
                                     JOEY
                        And why are you back?  Why are we here?
          
          Again, no signal from Elliott but the background changes
          magically once more;
          
          
          EXT.   FLANDERS FIELD   DAY
          
          Elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock, Joey
          standing close.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Because something worse is coming.
          
                                     (a beat)
          
                        I opened the Box, Joey.  I found the
                        monster within it.  And it found the
                        monster within me.  For decades I served
                        Hell with no memory of my former life
                        until a friend released me.  You saw
                        her.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your
                        soul was freed, why are you back?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Because - monster as I was - I was bound
                        by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box
                        had to be opened to let me out.  The
                        truly innocent were safe.  That's no
                        longer true.  The shell of the beast has
                        been fleshed.  What I was is out there,
                        Joey.  In your world.  Unbound.
                        Unstoppable.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What will he do?  What does he want?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        He'll do what he does best.  But he'll
                        do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the
                        Earth forever, indulging his taste for
                        all the myriad subtleties of human
                        suffering.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What can we do?
          
          
                                                                      74
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right
                        questions.  There is something we can do
                        but it will require great courage.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't know ...
          
          Elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek.  Gently.  Lovingly.
          We see in Joey's eyes that there is a response there.  A
          response beyond the comradely.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey, you walked through your window
                        from one reality to another.  You're
                        stronger than you think.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Then tell me what to do.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        This is his first night on Earth.  He
                        wants to close the door behind him.
                        Like all Lieutenants, he covets command.
                        There's a gateway to Hell through which
                        he can be taken back.  He has to destroy
                        it.
          
                                     JOEY
                        So where is it?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Your apartment.
          
          Joey gasps.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wha .... ?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          Lights flash.  Music pounds.  Kids dance.  It's a wild night at
          Under The Underground and it's about to get wilder.
          
          The source music (thrash metal) builds and builds, as if
          heading for a climax.  And then the climax comes.
          
          ANGLE ON DOOR TO JP'S ROOM
          
          
          
                                                                      75
          
          The door BLASTS open explosively from within.  The pieces of
          the shattered door FLY across the dance-floor, accompanied by
          chunks of plaster and brick from the door-surround.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES (QUICK CUTS)
          
          Flying wood and masonry hit people.
          
          One chunk SMASHES into the DJ console, bringing the music to a
          scratching, screeching end.
          
          Various SCREAMS are heard OFF through the ensuing silence.
          
          In the confusion, kids scramble for the main doorway.  Is it a
          bomb?  Is it a street-gang attack?
          
          The Main Doorway SLAMS supernaturally shut, bolts flying into
          place untouched by human (or inhuman) hand.
          
          Confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the source
          of the explosion.
          
          ANGLE ON DOORWAY TO JP'S ROOM
          
          Lit from behind by blinding beams of BLUE LIGHT, Pinhead
          emerges through the doorway.  Slow.  Elegant.  Terrifying.
          
          Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe-
          struck crowd look back at him.
          
          For the most part, the crowd are stunned into silence but there
          are a few murmurs from them;
          
                                     CROWD
                               (ad-lib)
                        Oh My God ...
          
                        Jesus Christ!
          
                        What the FUCK ... ?!
          
                        No no no no no no no ....
          
          Pinhead scans the club.
          
          He looks at the terrified humans.  The cruelly beautiful
          artworks.  The humans.  The artworks.  The humans.  The
          artworks.
          
          A small smile forms on his face.  He's just had an entertaining
          idea.
          
          
          
          
                                                                      76
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          The view through the big picture window is entirely normal
          again; the cityscape by night.
          
          Suddenly, Joey seems to appear behind the glass - translucent,
          like a reflection - and comes through the window into her
          apartment, "solidifying" as she steps in.
          
          Her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps.
          It's as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit
          her.  She falls forward onto the floor of her room, unconscious.
          
          FADE OUT
          
          FADE IN
          
           - as the ringing of a phone grows in volume.
          
          Joey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room
          trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her.
          
          She crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it.  The
          hand-set falls and she has to gather it up from the floor.
          Maneuvering herself into a sitting position, she speaks.
          
                                     JOEY

          She puts the phone down and rushes across to turn on the TV.
          
          
          TV IMAGE/DOC'S SHOULDERCAM:
          
          
          EXT.   CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB   NIGHT
          
          The images are confusing, with the rapid pans and temporary
          loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage.
          
          Doc's Camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people, trying
          to catch clear pictures of-what's been happening.
          
          Sirens howl, red emergency lights flash.
          
          
                                                                      77
          
          It becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster.
          Or a massacre.
          
          The club building looks like a bomb hit it.  Smoke and debris
          litter the street.  So do corpses.
          
          Some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies.  Others -
          glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as Doc is jostled and
          bustled - seem to be mutilated decoratively.  In fact they bear
          hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the
          club: armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire; flayed limbs with
          machinery inside instead of muscle.

          Suddenly, the images are blocked by a very BURLY COP pushing at
          the camera and talking directly into it.

          CLOSE on Joey's face as she reacts in horror to what she is
          seeing.    (INTERCUT with Doc's footage)
          
                                     JOEY

          BACK ON TV SCREEN
          
          Doc's camera pans around the area, past rubbernecking crowds,
          past shadowed alleys, past Police cars and ambulances vehicles
          ... and then whips back to an alley in the distance.

                        I thought ... what's ... I think there's
                        something up there ...
          
          Joey's eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the
          screen.
          
          
                                                                      78

          EXT.   ALLEYWAY   NIGHT    BACK ON TV SCREEN
          
          The hubbub and noise has died away.  Doc's camera is advancing
          up a very dimly-lit alley.  Hardly any detail can be seen.  The
          camera creeps forward ... forward ... forward ...
          
          Then suddenly a barely-glimpsed movement very close to the side
          and the camera swings wildly toward it.

          The face of Pinhead, almost lost to the darkness of the alley,
          is glimpsed on the screen as it looms toward the lens.
          
          The image disappears to darkness, over which Doc's SCREAM of
          mortal terror and agony can be heard before the blackness is
          suddenly replaced by a station identification card and then a

                        Well, we've ... er ... yes, we've
                        temporarily lost our pictures there and
                        ... and ...
          
          Joey has her hands at her mouth in horror.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Doc!  DOC!!
          
          Joey leaps to her feet, grabs the box from the TV, and stares
          at it in her hand.
          
          SMASH-CUT TO
          
          
          INT/EXT    JOEY'S CAR/CTTY STREETS   NIGHT
          
          Joey's hands grip her steering-wheel tightly.  Her face is
          drawn and grim.  The Box is on the seat beside her. She is
          driving very fast.
          
          She has to slam on the brakes at a red light.  She pounds at
          the dashboard in frustration.
          
                                     JOEY
                        C'mon.  C'mon!
          
          
          
          
                                                                      79
          
          EXT.   THE STREETS OF THE CITY   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on a terrified face.
          
          The face belongs to EDDIE, a 20 year old runner for a drug
          gang.  His head is pressed tight against a brick wall.  His
          nose is bleeding and his eye is red and ready to bruise.
          
                                     EDDIE
                        I'll get it!  I promise!  I'll ...
          
          A fist slams into Eddie's face.
          
          WIDER ANGLE REVEALS -
          
          An alley.  Eddie is being held against the wall by two
          uniformed COPS, one in his 40's, one in his 20's.  The elder
          cop has just punched Eddie in the face.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        Don't promise me shit, you little fuck!
                        You know what your promise is worth to
                        me?  Huh?  Fifty per cent of fuck-all!
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Give him the money, Eddie.
          
                                     EDDIE
                        I don't ...
          
          A big back-handed slap from the Elder Cop.
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Give him the money, Eddie.
          
                                     EDDIE
                        Just listen to me, Please!  I ...
          
          The Elder Cop gut-punches him and Eddie doubles up.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        I'm done listening, shit-brain!  Where
                        you been all day?  They shut the school?
                        Kindergarten closed?  No customers?
                        Huh?  Huh?
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Give him the money, Eddie.  Tell ya, I'm
                        gonna puke if he beats on you any more.
                        Just give him the ...
          
          The Younger Cop pauses, looking beyond them down the alley as a
          long black shadow falls over them.
          
          
                                                                      80
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        ... money.  What the ... ?
          
          The Elder Cop, at the change in his partner's tone, looks up.
          
          Standing in the center of the alley at its far end, light
          coming from behind him so that he is unclear, is Pinhead.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                               (Calm. Expecting obedience)
                        You, fuckoff.
          
          He turns back to Eddie.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        Get your head outta your stinkin' ass
                        and look at me, boy.
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                               (still looking down alley)
                        Hey ...
          
          Pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action.
          
          Elder Cop shoves Eddie away.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                               (to Eddie)
                        Get lost.
          
          Eddie doesn't waste time with questions.  He's gone.
          
          The Cops straighten up and start walking to meet Pinhead.
          
          Pinhead advances- still in the shadows, still just a black
          shape moving forward.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        I have the distinct impression I told
                        you to fuckoff.  Unless I miss my guess,
                        you've just disobeyed an officer of the
                        law.
          
          Pinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I am the Law.
          
          Cops halt in shock at this awesome presence, both of them
          instinctively drawing their guns.  And both instinctively
          beginning to back up.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and
                        you're about to dead meat.
                                                                      81
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I am the son of eternal night and you
                        are about to discover pain has no
                        ending.
          
          Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the
          law.  Both cops fire their guns.  Once.  Twice.  Three times.
          
          Pinhead keeps walking.  He spits out the bullets that his body
          has absorbed.
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Oh shh ...
          
          They empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run
          down the alley.  And then stop short.  There is a sudden wall
          of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world
          simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet.
          
          The cops turn, terrified, to look back.  Instinctively, they
          spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls.
          
          The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape.  He glances
          up as if he might be able to jump up to safety.  No.  Too high.
          
          Pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command.
          
          Suddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible
          speed and force.
          
          The Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream.  The ladder
          smashes right through his body, impaling him.
          
          His corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped
          around the ladder.
          
          Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.
          
          Pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Curb your tongue.
          
          The Elder Cop's body starts to move involuntarily.  His
          movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to
          fight what his body is trying to do.
          
          Pinhead's head moves through various positions.  His face is
          calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but
          only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new-
          found skills.
          
                                                                      82
          
          The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs
          from his belt.
          
          His eyes show terror.  Everything else is beyond his control.
          
          He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open.
          
          His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes.
          
          The fear in his eyes increases.
          
          He moves the open cuff over his tongue.  He's making panicked
          moaning noises as if trying to scream.
          
          SLAM!  He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue!
          
          And SCREAMS (as best he can).
          
          Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and makes
          another commanding gesture with his head.
          
          A Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the
          other cuff.
          
          The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the
          darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along
          the alley into the blackness.
          
          The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped
          into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead.
          
          
          EXT.   CITY STREETS, NEAR CLUB   NIGHT
          
          A Paramedic is attempting to hold Joey back.  In the distance
          behind them is the wreckage of the club.  They are standing
          near the alley into which Doc's camera disappeared.
          
                                     JOEY
                        But I have to see him!  I'm his friend!
          
                                     PARAMEDIC
                        Lady, trust me!  You really don't want
                        to go ...
          
          But Joey has slipped past his obstructing arm and runs on into
          the alley.
          
          And pulls to a horrified stop.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No!  NO!!
          
          REVERSE ANGLE - JOEY'S POV
          
                                                                      83
          
          The scene is well-lit by Police emergency lights.  It is taped
          off by yellow DO NOT CROSS banners.  Paramedics and cops stand
          around in various states of shock or disgust.
          
          In the middle of it all is Doc.  Quite dead.
          
          The body is kneeling up, its cold hands resting on its lap and
          holding its severed head which stares up at its shoulders.  The
          camera has been shoved deep between the corpse's shoulder
          blades and is angled down as if filming its dead face.
          
          CLOSE on Joey's devastated face.
          
          
          EXT.   INNER-CITY CHURCH   NIGHT
          
          An establishing shot of a church at the top of a small hill.
          
          
          INT.   INNER-CITY CHURCH   NIGHT
          
          The Church is in semi-darkness.  Some candles at an offertory,
          some others on an altar, provide the only light.
          
          On the very front pew a PRIEST sits, head bent low in prayer.
          
          The Priest is a young man.  Probably a good man.  We're not
          really going to have the time to find out.
          
          A shadow seems to pass over the Priest's bowed head.
          
          At first, it seems he hasn't noticed.  Then he looks up, a
          little puzzled.  He looks to his right, his left, then shifts
          in the pew to look back along the central aisle.
          
          There are rows and rows of empty pews and, in the distance, the
          Church door ... which is ajar.
          
          The Priest stands, walks to the start of the aisle, and looks
          back along it again.
          
                                     PRIEST
                               (calling down aisle)
                        Is there anyone there?  Hello?
          
          Silence.  A beat.
          
          The Priest looks puzzled.  We see his mind work.  He's looked
          right, looked left, looked down ... How about ...?
          
          He turns right round to face the altar.
          
          PRIEST'S POV
          
          
                                                                      84
          
          To the Priest, it's an image of nightmarish blasphemy.  Even to
          us heathens, it's pretty shocking;
          
          Pinhead in all his dark glory is standing behind the altar.
          
                                     PRIEST
                        How dare you!
          
          It gets worse.  Pinhead, staring at the Priest all the while,
          reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract
          one of the pins from his skull.
          
          The pin is horribly long and, sickeningly, the last few inches
          aren't metal at all but some kind of infernal worm - dark,
          slimy, and befanged.
          
          Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly
          burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it.  He
          repeats the operation with the other palm.
          
          He turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous
          parody of Christ's stigmata.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I am the Way.
          
          The Priest rushes up to the altar to Pinhead.
          
                                     PRIEST
                        You'll burn in Hell for this!
          
          The Priest reaches him.  Pinhead's hand is on his throat
          instantly, squeezing silence from him.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Burn?  What a limited imagination.
          
          The choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him to
          his knees before him.
          
          Pinhead towers over the Priest.  He smiles.
          
          With his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from
          the decorative wounds on his chest.  He holds the bloody piece
          of meat up.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        This is my body.  This is my blood.
                        Happy are they who come to my supper.
          
          Pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh
          into the Priest's aghast mouth.
          
          Pinhead flings the priest away from him.
          
                                                                      85
          
          The Priest lands heavily on the floor.
          
          Pinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside.
          
          All the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing
          through the Church.
          
          Pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi-conscious Priest.
          
          And all the candles go out.
          
          BLACKNESS
          
          
          INT/EXT   JOEY'S CAR/CITY STREETS   NIGHT
          
          Joey is driving again.  And this time she's not even stopping
          at red lights.  She steams across junctions, leaving cars
          swerving and horns honking in her wake.
          
          Something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side.
          
                                     JOEY
                               (appalled)
                        Oh God ...
          
          JOEY'S (MOVING) POV
          
          Up a side street, atop a hill, is the Inner-city Church.  It's
          on fire.
          
          Joey swings the car up the hill.
          
          SMASH-CUT TO:
          
          Joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church.  Off to
          her side is a smaller building, the Church Hall.
          
          Joey shakes her head at the desecration.  She has no doubt
          who's responsible.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Having fun en route, you bastard.
          
          Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
          
          Joey freezes in terror then slowly - very slowly - turns round.
          
          JOEY'S POV - SHOCK REVEAL
          
          The Priest - now mercifully dead - is crucified against the
          side wall of the smaller building.  Pinhead's nails protrude
          from his palms and his ankles.
          
          
                                                                      86
          
          EXT   CITY STREETS   NIGHT
          
          A SERIES of QUICK CUTS of Joey's car tearing through the
          darkness heading back to her apartment.
          
          
          INT.   CORRIDOR, JOEY'S APT. BLDG.   NIGHT
          
          Joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door, hurriedly
          turns the lock and rushes in.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          Joey closes her door and switches on the light.  The mood is
          suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.  It's
          very still, very slow, very quiet.
          
          Perhaps it's too quiet:  Joey moves into the room slowly,
          clutching the Box in her hands and glancing round.  Her manner
          makes the mood suddenly creepy.  Is the monster already in the
          house?
          
          Very slowly, very carefully, Joey begins to move round her
          apartment.  Hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she
          checks her doors.  The kitchen ... empty.  The bedroom ...
          empty.  The bathroom ... empty.
          
          Joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to
          her big picture window.  Slowly, she lets out a big breath and
          then draws an equally slow one in.  Maybe it's alright ...
          maybe the monster isn't here ... maybe ...
          
          Magically, eerily, slowly, the Box begins to rise from Joey's
          hand.  Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh shit ...
          
          Maybe there's one place she hasn't checked.  Swallowing
          nervously, Joey tilts her head up and back, her eyes rising up
          in their sockets.
          
          The camera tilts low ... low ... lower ... taking in a wider
          view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending Box ...
          
          And the audience screams!
          
          Like a spider or a lizard, Pinhead is flat against the ceiling,
          arms stretched out for balance, his face staring down at Joey.
          
          Joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams.
          
          
          
                                                                      87
          
          Pinhead, angling down feet first, floats elegantly to the floor
          to stand facing Joey.  The Box lands in one of his outstretched
          hands.  He holds it out to show Joey ... and then suddenly
          closes his powerful hand on it, apparently crushing it.
          
          He flings the remnants from him and they land on Joey's floor -
          Chunks and splinters of wood, whirring and spinning machinery
          of gold and silver, and scores of tiny writhing worms.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No!
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Watch.
          
          Thanks to the miracles of trick photography, the remnants
          suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the
          Box which sits there intact on the floor.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        The Box can't be destroyed.  Like pain
                        or the poor, it is always with us.  But
                        as long as I have it, no-one can open
                        it.  Now come here and die.  You have
                        friends in Hell waiting to greet you.
          
          Joey begins to back across the room toward her window.
          
                                     JOEY
                        You'll have to come and get me, you ugly
                        bastard.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Spirited.  Good.  I'll enjoy making you
                        bleed.  I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.
          
          Pinhead starts across the room.
          
          Joey looks at her window.  It's the normal view ... with the
          normal seven-story drop.
          
          Pinhead closes.
          
          She bites her lip, goes for it: in a literal and metaphorical
          leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it.
          
          The window shatters.
          
          Pinhead's arm reaches out after Joey as if to grab her and pull
          her back.
          
          SIDELONG ANGLE
          
          
          
                                                                      88
          
           - shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows
          the night-time cityscape beyond the window.  What it doesn't
          show is the front of the monster's arm.  That's somewhere else.
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          INT.   QUONSET HUT
          
          CLOSE on Pinhead's arm, still clutching at the air.
          
          Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps
          Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
          
          WIDER ANGLE (WITH OPTICAL F/X)
          
          Elliott literally pulls Pinhead through from one reality to
          another - we see parts of the monster appearing and
          disappearing in front of the Hut wall as if glimpsed through
          tears in reality.  It's like a tug-of-war which Elliott wins -
          Suddenly Pinhead's there on the floor of the Quonset hut.
          
          And his other self - Elliott - still has hold of his hand.
          
          Pinhead throws a glance around the Hut.  He recognizes it ...
          and the frozen figure at the top end perched before the Box.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                               (furious rage)
                        Aahhhh!!!
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey!  Back to the wall, quickly!
          
          Joey runs around then to the far wall - just in time because
          now the pyrotechnics start.
          
          Elliott tightens his grip and (with a nice series of INTERCUT
          CLOSE-UPS of these two alternative selves) the life-forces of
          Elliott and Pinhead begin to erupt.
          
          ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHT begins to play over both their bodies.
          It's apparently agonizing, both figures arching with the pain,
          both faces grimacing.
          
          Joey watches, wincing in sympathetic agony.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Elliott!  No!  What about you?!  Where
                        will you be?!
          
          Elliott grunts his answer through the agony.
          
          
          
                                                                      89
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Back with the damned.  No more hope of
                        heaven.  But I drag this monster back
                        with me!
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You stupid interfering foo ... AAAAAH!
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE THREE SELVES - PINHEAD, ELLIOTT, AND THE
          SEATED OFFICER
          
          The essences of Pinhead and Elliott - drawn from their bodies
          as sweeping, glowing, spitting arcs of BLUE LIGHT - crackle in
          the air of the Hut like a miniature electrical storm ...
          
          Until they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc
          which flies at the body of the seated Officer and disappears
          inside him in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
          
          And suddenly, as vision returns, there is only the seated
          officer   (and, at the far end of the room, Joey).
          
          And, almost as suddenly, the frozen scene comes to life;
          
          The radio near the camp bed is playing.
          
          A bead of sweat falls down the Officer's face as he reaches
          forward to pick up the Box.
          
          The Officer, apparently completely unaware of Joey's presence,
          begins to work the Box.
          
          As the process works through, we INTERCUT CONSTANTLY BETWEEN
          
          1)  The Officer's hands and the movements of the Box here in
          the Hut in 1921.
          
          2)  EXACTLY MATCHING movements of the Box back on the floor of
          Joey's apartment in 1992.  Moving on its own, linked across the
          years to its earlier self.
          
          3)  Joey watching the movements in the Hut.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Elliott? ... Elliott? ... You can't
                        hear me, can you?  It's 1921.  I'm not
                        really here ...
          
          Suddenly, small patterns of BLUE LIGHT arc across the Box,
          shocking the Officer who drops the Box and then stares in shock
          and fascination as ...
          
          On the floor, the box begins to open.
          
          The Officer kneels up and leans over the Box ...
                                                                      90
          
          And the chains fly!  Shooting up from within and hooking
          themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
          
          CLOSE ON the Officer's face, howling in agony.
          
          CLOSE ON Joey's face, sobbing in distress.  She throws up her
          hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and, when she
          lowers them, ...
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          .. she's back in her room. Alone.  Window intact.  Normal view.
          
          Joey stares around, her face a mix of sadness and relief.
          
          The mood now is very down, post-cataclysmic, post-adventure.
          
          Joey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the
          kitchen door.
          
          She crosses the floor without glancing down at it.  Why should
          she?  Everything's over.  But we notice, even if she doesn't,
          that the Box is no longer there.  But we hardly have time to
          register this before ...
          
          Joey opens the kitchen door.
          
                                     JOEY
                        (SCREAMS!!!!)
          
          Pinhead is framed in the doorway.
          
          Behind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of Hell
          - like the Torture Rooms in HELLRAISER and HELLBOUND, it is
          full of shadowy pillars and chains.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?
          
          Joey backs away, shaking her head in shocked denial.
          
          Pinhead moves forward, very leisurely.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        This will be so good, Joey.  You loved
                        him, didn't you?  I can feel him inside,
                        weeping for you.  He can watch through
                        the centuries as we discover the things
                        that make you whimper.
          
          Joey's mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door.
          
          She reaches it, throws it open ... and screams.
          
                                                                      91
          
          JP Monroe is in the doorway - but he's only just recognizable.
          He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and
          decorated with metal and leather.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You never met, did you?  This was JP
                        Monroe.
          
                                     JP CENOBITE
                        Have you seen what they did to me?  Have
                        you seen what they did?  You interfering
                        little whore!
          
          The JP Cenobite moves into the room.
          
          Joey, now near hysteria, rushes across the room again to the
          one remaining door - her bedroom.
          
          She throws that one open ...
          
          And Terri, the new FEMALE CENOBITE, walks out at her.  She has
          the open Box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from
          different holes in her cheek and face.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri?  Oh no!  NO!!  TERRI!!
          
                                     TERRI CENOBITE
                        Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You
                        think you're going to live forever?
          
          Pinhead and JP are advancing across the room toward Joey and
          Terri.  Joey only has seconds to act ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wanna light, you bitch?!
          
          Joey pulls her father's Zippo from her pocket and sparks it up
          as she swings it through the air close to Terri's face.
          
          A huge FLAME shoots out of the Zippo (as in the earlier scene)
          and scours across Terri's face.
          
          Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ... and the
          Box flies from her hands.
          
          Joey catches it, spins it, closes it!
          
          An arc of BLUE LIGHT zaps across to Terri and she's gone ...
          
          Still in one movement, swinging on her heels, Joey twists the
          box again ...
          
          And another Arc of LIGHT zaps JP away ...
          
                                                                      92
          
          Joey completes her turn.  She's facing Pinhead.  She holds the
          Box before her like a weapon ... and she's got the monster in
          her sights ...
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Wait!
          
          His hands are raised palms out.  He's stopped advancing.
          
          Joey holds the Box ready, breathing heavy, waiting ...
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You can send me back.  But why?  I can
                        help you, Joey.  I can give you what you
                        want.
          
                                     JOEY
                        You'll never know what I want ...
          
          (Despite what she's said, we see Joey's face register every
          word of Pinhead's reply, every nuance, every promise ... )
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Respect.  Power.  You and I can put your
                        name on the World's lips, your face on
                        it's screens ...
          
          Camera TRACKS closer to the Box in Joey's hands as Pinhead
          speaks.  Closer and closer until it's side fills the screen.
          
          CROSS-FADE
          
          
          INT.  MS. SUMMERSKILL'S OFFICE   DAY
          
          CLOSE on the face of the Box, still filling the screen.
          
          SLOW PULL BACK to reveal that the Box is mounted on a plinth
          within a glass bell-jar.
          
          PULL BACK continues.  The bell-jar stands on a tall thin wooden
          sculpture stand.
          
          PULL BACK continues.  The stand is next to a large impressive
          desk in an even larger even more impressive office.
          
          And seated behind the desk is ... well, we can't really call
          her Joey - she's far too impressive for that ... is Ms. Joanne
          Summerskill.
          
          Her hair is different.  Her make-up is different.  Her clothes
          are different.  Everything about this woman speaks of power and
          sophistication.

1  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                               1

   Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses,
   illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning
   against an alley wall.

   He is waiting.

   Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first.
   They size each other up as best they can.

                                FIRST MAN
                          MacLeod.

   The second nods.

   The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended
   thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash
   of metal severs the agressor's head.


2  INT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              2

   A 15th century Scottish home.

   A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron,
   stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag
   a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot
   of grey soup.

   From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up
   in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters.

                                MOTHER
                          My, but are you the
                          picture.

                                CONOR
                          (surveying himself)
                          It's a bit tight.

   His FATHER enters with a pail of milk.

                                FATHER
                          Ah, Conor, how you look
                          a man.

                                MOTHER
                          Have you time for some-
                          thing to eat?

                                CONOR
                          No, Mother.  They'll be
                          here shortly.

   Conor's father looks him over with pride.

                                FATHER
                          Your grandfather wore
                          that in his service to
                          the King, and I to fight
                          for the Duke.

                                MOTHER
                          Must he go?

                                FATHER
                          Aye.  It is his duty.  All
                          of ours.

                                MOTHER
                          But Ian, he's still but a boy.

                                FATHER
                          He's a MacLeod.

                                CONOR
                          I'll be fine Mother.


3  EXT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              3

   Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to
   the cottage door.

   Conor's father steps out to meet them.


4  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            4

   A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling-
   ing to his helmet and breastplate.  A CLANSMAN hikes up the
   heather-carpeted slope to him.

                                CLANSMAN
                          They march.

                                KNIGHT
                          Is the boy among them?

                                CLANSMAN
                          Aye.


5  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                5

   The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first.

   With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.


6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6

   The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain.
   Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The
   low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There
   is an erie, smothering silence.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Is a bad day for this.

                                VASSAL #2
                          The Duke has been compro-
                          mised.  He will have his due.

                                VASSAL #1
                          By day's end he will have
                          our heads.

                                VASSAL #2
                          We ride against the Suther-
                          lands.  That is all that
                          matters.

                                VASSAL #1
                          This makes no sense to me.

   CONOR

   And a friend are marching through the moist heather.

                                FRIEND
                          The fog is bad.  We cannot
                          even see the sides of our
                          own ranks.

   Conor's nervousness is showing.

                                FRIEND
                          Is this your first?

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

  SHOUTING is heard on the plain.

                                FRIEND
                          It's begun.

7  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            7

   The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.
   He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.

8  EXT. PLAIN - MORNING                                              8

   The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan
   and clashing swords.  The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-
   citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.

   The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with
   his opponent.

   THE KNIGHT

   Rides calmly through the fracas.  He strikes and kills those
   that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.

   He is looking.

   CONOR

   Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.
   Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.
   He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.

   Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.

   The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy.  His fear turned
   to panic, Conor turns and flees.

   The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his
   horse into persuit.

   Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight
   brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing
   open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into
   the heather.

   As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in
   time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.

   THE KNIGHT

   Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the
   boy's.  His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.

                                KNIGHT
                          There can be but one.

   A CLANSMAN

   Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him
   nearly in half.  ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.

   The battle is shifting to where they are.

   Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself
   forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-
   ants.

   A VASSAL

   Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted
   Knight.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Leave him!

   The clansmen obey.

   With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the
   Knight disappears into the fog.

   The Vassal surveys the carnage before him.  His eyes fall a
   moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.

   The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.


9  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                9

   A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.

   The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his
   sword into a near-by drain.  He straightens up and waits.

   AN OFFICER

   Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward.  His PARTNER
   switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley
   in a harsh glare.

   MAN IN ALLEY

   For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad
   in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.

   The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively
   for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the
   alley.

                                OFFICER #1
                          Kevin!  Get is a backup.

                                TAUPIN
                          I was merely walking by
                          when-

                                OFFICER #1
                          Don't move.

   The officer has his pistol out and leveled.
   His partner runs up, shotgun in hand.

                                OFFICER #2
                          They're on their way.

   His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe.

                                OFFICER #2

                          Christ.


10  INT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              10

    Conor lies moaning on a cot.  Makeshift bandages wrap his
    body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood.

    The family surrounds their dying son.

    A PRIEST is delivering the last rites.

                                PRIEST
                          ...Libera Domine Animan
                          servi tui sicut libertasi
                          David de manu regis Saul...

    His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead.

                                PRIEST
                          ...In mamus tuas domine
                          commendo spiritum meum...


11  EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              11

    A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a
    CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Has the boy died?

                                CLANSMAN
                          He is having the last rites
                          now.  It should be over by
                          morning.

                                VASSAL #1
                          Never seen anybody cut as
                          bad live so long.  He should
                          have died on the field.

                                CLANSMAN
                          Tonight or tomorrow, it's
                          all the same.

    The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the
    sacraments.

                                PRIEST
                          ...Auditorium nostrum in
                          nomine domini...

                                VASSAL #1
                          This has been a dark day.

                                PRIEST
                          ...Requiescant in pace...


12  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                              12

    There is a bustle of activity.  Setting up barricades, uni-
    formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious
    ONLOOKERS at a distance.

    DETECTIVE LT. MORAN

    Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him,
    is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER.

                                EXAMINER
                             (studying body)
                          Real clean.  No sawing
                          action at all.  Whatever
                          it was did it in one
                          swipe.
                           (looks up at Moran)
                          Like the other one.

    Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby.

                                MORAN
                          What about that?

                                EXAMINER
                          Hasn't any blood on it.

                                MORAN
                             (looking around)
                          About the only thing
                          that doesn't.

                                EXAMINER
                          I'll give it a closer
                          look when I get back.

    BRENNA CARTWRIGHT

    Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of
    insolent intelligence.

    An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade.

                                OFFICER #3
                          Come on Brenna, you know
                          better than that.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm invited.

    She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his
    equipment.

                                BRENNA
                              (greeting)
                          Mr. Levine...

    The examiner turns and smiles.

                                EXAMINER
                          Hope this isn't past your
                          bedtime.

    Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from
    where the head should be.

                                BRENNA
                          Doesn't have a head,
                          does he?

                                EXAMINER
                          This one came unassembled.

    Lt. Moran is standing near.

                                MORAN
                             (no warmth)
                          Just show her what she came
                          for, Tom.

                                EXAMINER
                        (stands, taps Brenna's arm)
                          Come on, this is more
                          your line of work.

    Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse
    to the sword.

                                EXAMINER
                          How's your uncle?  I hardly
                          ever see him anymore.

                                BRENNA
                          Fine.

    The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in
    forensic plastic.

                                EXAMINER
                          There you go.

    Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down
    beside it.

                                EXAMINER
                          Didn't look like it came from
                          "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I
                          called you.

                                BRENNA
                        (looks up in Moran's direction)
                          Didn't think it was my
                          buddy over there.

                                EXAMINER
                          Figured you knew more about
                          swords than I did.

                                BRENNA
                          Claymore.

                                EXAMINER
                          Huh?

                                BRENNA
                          Scottish claymore.  Take
                          a French epee, add twenty
                          pounds of ballast so it
                          means business, and you've
                          got a claymore.

                                EXAMINER
                          You're the expert.

                                BRENNA
                        (runs hand along hilt, slightly
                               confused)
                          It's in good condition.

    RICHARD TAUPIN

    Is being put in the rear of a patrol car.  Brenna studies his
    face in the half-gloom.  There's something different about him.
    A steadiness.


13  INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM                                  13

    Richard Taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a
    room otherwise bare of furnishings.  He seems unphased by his
    surroundings.

    The door opens and Moran enters with bag and notebook.  He
    picks up Taupin's wallet on the table top and checks the
    driver's license.

                                MORAN
                          This your present address?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                MORAN
                          Mr.-
                          (looks at license)
                          Taupin, what were you
                          doing in that alley?

                                TAUPIN
                          I was walking by when I
                          heard a shout.  Your men
                          came right after.

                                MORAN
                          Did you know the victim?

                                TAUPIN
                          No.

                                MORAN
                          His name was Iman Fasil
                          if that jogs your memory.

                                TAUPIN
                          It doesn't.

                                MORAN
                          He was carrying a Syrian
                          passport and had been in
                          the country less than a week.

    Taupin's face is stoic and controlled.

                                MORAN
                          Two days ago a Bulgarian
                          national was murdered the
                          same way.  He'd also been
                          in the country less than a
                          week.
                                (beat)
                          What is your citizenship?

                                TAUPIN
                          American.

    Moran paces to a corner of the room.

                                MORAN
                          Do you make a habit of
                          hanging out in that neigh-
                          borhood at night?

                                TAUPIN
                          What are you getting at?

                                MORAN
                          Let's just say that in my
                          years with this department
                          I've seen more than one well
                          dressed business man look for
                          a hand job on 14th Street.

    Moran places both hands on the table and leans across it.

                                MORAN
                          What were _you_ looking for?

                                TAUPIN
                          That's none of your business.

                                MORAN
                          You're wrong.

    Moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large
    broad sword; old, but in mint condition.

                                MORAN
                          Do you know what this is?

                                TAUPIN
                          I presume it's a sword.

                                MORAN
                          A claymore to be exact.  You
                          wouldn't know anything about
                          it would you?

                                TAUPIN
                          Your murder weapon?

                                MORAN
                          It was covered with Mr.
                          Fasil's fingerprints, but
                          none of his blood.

                                TAUPIN
                          A mystery.

                                MORAN
                          For the moment.

    Moran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down.
    He rises and opens the door.

                                MORAN
                          All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in
                          touch.

    Taupin passes through the doorway without comment.


14  EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT                                     14

    Taupin out into the crisp night air.  His eyes search out the
    darkness.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

15  EXT. CONOR'S FAMILY HUTCH - DAY                                 15

    A medieval sun beats down on an OLD TRAVELER making his way up
    the MacLeod home.  Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a
    bucket, smiles in recognition.

                                MOTHER
                          Ah Steven, it is good to see you.

                                TRAVELLER
                          I only just heard of Conor.  I came
                          up from Catroch as soon as I could.

                                MOTHER
                          You're a kind man to be sure.

                                TRAVELLER
                          I thought it only proper to pay
                          me last respects to the family.

                                MOTHER
                          Steven, Conor didn't die.

                                TRAVELLER
                          But I had heard his wounds were
                          mortal.

                                MOTHER
                          They were Steven, they were.  It's
                          been a miracle it has.  He lasted
                          right through and healed.  No one
                          in the village has ever seen anything
                          like it.  Ever.


16  EXT. MEADOW - DAY                                               16

    Perched on a heather-carpeted rise above the village a young
    woman, MARA, sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil.

    Balancing on a shepard's staff, Conor limps over and puts
    his lips to her ear.

                                CONOR
                          You're pretty today.

    Mara is silent.  Distant.

                                CONOR
                          I'm your future husband, remember?

                                MARA
                          I have no future husband.

                                CONOR
                          I don't understand.  Not a week
                          ago your father gave us his blessing.

    This is difficult for her.  Tears well in her eyes.

                                MARA
                          My future husband died in battle
                          against the Sutherlands.

                                CONOR
                          What are you saying?  I'm standing
                          here as real as you.

                                MARA
                          You cannot be real, Conor.  You had
                          the last rites.  No man has been cut
                          half as bad and lived.

                                CONOR
                          But I did live.

                                MARA
                          Live?  In less than a week you're
                          prancing about the country like a
                          squirrel.

                                CONOR
                          So why the crazy talk?  It's a
                          miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has
                          smiled on me.  On us.

                                MARA
                          Some think not.

                                CONOR
                          Who?

                                MARA
                          There's rumor in the village.
                          Some call it magic.

                                CONOR
                          That's mad.  Surely you don't
                          take their word?

                                MARA
                          I don't know, Conor.  It's not
                          natural.  Maybe something has
                          touched you.

                                CONOR
                          You're sounding like that mad
                          woman, Widow Baggins.

                                MARA
                          Me father has taken back my
                          hand.

    He puts a hand to her cheek.

                                CONOR
                          Ah, Lassie...

    She steps back.

                                MARA
                          Please not be touching me, Conor.

                                CONOR
                          I'll not take that kind of talk
                          from you.  From those others
                          below, maybe.  But not from you.

                                MARA
                          Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.

                                CONOR
                          You're not talking sense, Mara!

    Anger tumbles into exasperation.

                                CONOR

                          I'm sorry.

    He steps for her.  She moves away.  Conor's face hardens with
    resentment.

                                CONOR
                          If you send me away now, Mara,
                          I'll not come looking for you.

                                MARA
                             (crying)
                          Do what you must.

    Resigned, Conor turns and limps away.

    Taupin is hardly in the mood.


18  INT. TAUPIN'S OFFICE                                            18

    Brenna Cartwright stands in Taupin's cluttered surroundings
    admiring a bagpipe set neatly on a shelf.

                                BRENNA
                          Do you play?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          Very traditional.

    Taupin sits down and begins sorting through a stack of papers
    on his desk.

                                TAUPIN
                             (impatient)
                          Miss Cartwright, what is it I can
                          do for you?

                                BRENNA
                          I'd like to ask you about the
                          claymore.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's not mine.

                                BRENNA
                          It's quite rare you know, some-
                          thing so common in its time so
                          well looked after all these years.

                                TAUPIN
                          Miss Cartwright, unless you have
                          come here to sell the sword,
                          there's very little I can help
                          you with.  Now if you will excuse
                          me, I have a great deal of work
                          to do.

    Brenna has taken a carving from the shelf.

                                BRENNA
                          Byzantine?

                          Charming guy, Basil.  Once after
                          beating an army of Serbians he
                          blinded all but-

                          -All but one out of a hundred, I

                          donkeys back home.  Now if you will
                          please-

    Brenna suddenly tosses the carving at him.  Taupin snatches it
    out of the air with lightning precision.

                                BRENNA
                          Good reflexes.

                                TAUPIN
                          Good day, Miss Cartwright.


19  INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM DEPARTMENT OFFICE                       19

    A lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken
    study tables.

    The department SUPERVISOR sits at his desk surrounded by a
    handful of his staff RESEARCHERS - Brenna included.  A faded,
    stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped
    up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches.

                                BRENNA
                          I don't believe him.

                                SUPERVISOR
                          Why?

                                BRENNA
                          He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I
                          think he's got something to
                          do with it.

                                RESEARCHER #1
                          Oh, has your penetrating research
                          on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos
                          suddenly made you an expert on the
                          criminal mentality?

                                BRENNA
                          Screw off, Larry.

    The men, LAUGH.  They delight in baiting her.
    Researcher #2 opens a Budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval
    mug he's borrowed from the collection.

                                RESEARCHER #2
                          The cops bought it.  They let him
                          go.

                                BRENNA
                          What could they hold him for?  I
                          think they're just waiting for
                          something concrete before they
                          haul him in for real.  We should
                          look into it.  He had to have
                          gotten that sword from somewhere.

                                SUPERVISOR
                          Hang on a sec, you did your little
                          favor for the boys downtown, I'm
                          sure your uncle and the rest are
                          perfectly capable of taking it
                          from here.

                                BRENNA
                          I've seen nobleman swords that
                          weren't as well preserved.  It's
                          just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why
                          would he be carrying it around
                          in an alley?

                                RESEARCHER #1
                          Here we go.  Everytime there's a
                          murder in town we have to put up
                          with junior D.A.

                          Must be genetic.

                                BRENNA
                          Someone should check him out.
                          Maybe a collection somewhere
                          got knocked over.  He has one,
                          he might have two.

                                SUPERVISOR
                          You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see
                          the crap piled up on it?

                                BRENNA
                          Give it a rest Ned, huh?

                                RESEARCHER #2
                          Might be interesting to see what
                          his family connections are.  That's
                          a hell of a piece to be just chuck-
                          ing around in an alley.

                                SUPERVISOR
                                  (sighs)
                          I swear to God Brenna, between you
                          and Thompson's novels I'm going to
                          get a bloody ulcer.

    Researcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth.

                                                                CUT TO:

    An empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking
    establishment.

    CLANSMEN, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in
    the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow VILLAGERS.

    No longer requiring the use of a cane, Conor enters.

                                CONOR
                              (to owner)
                          Evening, Douglas.

                                DOUGLAS
                          Conor.

    The tavern goes silent.  Wary.  The attention is on Conor.

                                CONOR
                          Ale suits me.

    The owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug.  Conor takes
    it and walks to where four other VILLAGERS sit.

                                TAVERN MAN #1
                          We rather you not be sitting with
                          us, Conor.

    Conor looks to the next table.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          We be drinking alone as well.

    The entire tavern spells the same sentiments.

                                CONOR
                          What's wrong with you all?

    Silence.

    Angered, Conor approaches the second man.  As he looms above
    his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts
    it forward.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          Requiem acer'nam donaei-

                                CONOR
                          What are you doing man?

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -Et lux perpetua-

                                CONOR
                          You'll not be bringing the church
                          into this.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -Luceat ei-

    The weird display frightens Conor.

                                CONOR
                          Be quiet.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -Auditorium nostrum-

                                CONOR
                          Stop.

                                TAVERN MAN #2
                          -In nomine sanctus esperitu-

                                CONOR
                          Stop!

    Conor HURLES his mug against the wall.
    His nerves shattered, he rushes out.


21  INT. MACLEOD HUTCH                                              21

    Conor packs a satchel with his few clothes and belongings.
    He walks to the doorway where his mother and father wait.

    His mother, tears on her cheek, hugs him tightly.

                                MOTHER
                          Please take care of yourself.

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

    Conor turns to his father.

                                FATHER
                          I wish there was some other way.

    They clasp hands.

                                FATHER
                          Goodbye, Conor.

                                CONOR
                          Goodbye.

    Without looking back he passes through the doorway and down the
    empty path, his figure quickly fading in the moorish fog.

    Amongst the dinge of CLANGING phones and CLACKING typewriters,
    a uniformed OFFICER enters something into a computer terminal.
    Brenna sits perched on a desk nearby.

23  EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY                                    23

    Taupin steps out of a Metro station and walks the few blocks
    to his brick townhouse.  Climbing the front stairs, he fishes
    his keys out of a coat pocket.  About to insert the key he stops,
    sensing something.

    Backing down the steps, Taupin slips around to the rear of the
    building.

24  INT. TAUPIN HOME                                                24

    Like a spider Taupin pries open a window and slips silently
    inside.

    The home is dark and still.

    Taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway.
    There a MAN, dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible
    in the dim light, is crouched at the front door.

    He is holding a sword.

    Taupin removes a knife from his pocket and JUMPS the intruder.
    The two STRUGGLE fiercely.

    Taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his
    knife firmly against the man's throat.

                                TAUPIN
                          Where is he?

    Bulging eyes stare at him.

                                TAUPIN
                          Where!

                                INTRUDER
                          I don't know.

                                TAUPIN
                          What name is he using?

    Taupin presses the blade.  A trickle of blood rolls down the
    throat.

                                INTRUDER
                          Smith.  Carl Smith.

                                TAUPIN
                          How many came?

                                INTRUDER
                          The last four.

                                TAUPIN
                          And the Bulgarian?

                                INTRUDER
                          He got him.
                             (hoarse chuckle)
                          He always does.  Eventually.

                                TAUPIN
                          He knows I'm here.  How?

                                INTRUDER
                          None of this would be happening
                          if you hadn't run...

    The knife is pressed deeper.

                                TAUPIN
                          _Answer_ me.

                                INTRUDER
                               (gasping)
                          We learned he'd found the immigration
                          notaries in Liverpool and traced them
                          to New York.  Then he figured out the
                          birth records in Church Hill...


25  EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY                                        25

    A city limit sign announcing the small community of Church
    Hill is overtaken by Brenna's sedan.


26  EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY                        26

    Brenna looks through a telephone book.

                                BRENNA
                          Taupin...Taupin...

    Nothing.  She closes the book and drums her fingers on the cover.


27  EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY                                27

    An 1860s stone columned affair, far more impressive than the
    low-lying town that surrounds it.

    Brenna enters.


28  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                      28

    Brenna sits sifting through a large cloth-bound book entitled
    _Certificates of Birth: 1941-1948_.

                                BRENNA
                              (reading)
                          Tarmin...Tatum...Taupin, Richard
                          Marshall.  Born to William and
                          Karen Taupin, no address.  Attend-
                          ing physician, Dr. Willis Kidell.

29  INT. DR. KIDELL'S HOME                                          29

    Dr. Kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder.

                                KIDELL
                          1945, that strains the memory.
                               (after a fashion)
                          Here we are, Richard Taupin.

    He carries the binder to the table where Brenna sits.

                                KIDELL
                          Would you like more tea?

                                BRENNA
                          No thank you, I'm fine.

    Kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page.

                                KIDELL
                          He was unsual.

                                BRENNA
                          Why?

                                KIDELL
                          Well, this is a small town, and
                          it was even smaller then.  Most
                          all the babies I delivered were
                          from local families.  Richard's
                          parents were just passing through
                          when his mother's time came.  I
                          did it right here at the house.

                                BRENNA
                          Then you didn't know Richard
                          later on.

                                KIDELL
                          No.

                                BRENNA
                          I've been trying to find somebody
                          who knew him and any connections
                          his family might have had with
                          museums or historical societies.

                                KIDELL
                          Don't know about any of that.
                          Suppose nobody does.

                                BRENNA
                          I don't follow you.

                                KIDELL
                          Poor little tyke didn't have a
                          chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He
                          died a few days after he was born.

                                BRENNA
                          The boy _died_?

                                KIDELL
                          Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The
                          young lady just couldn't make it
                          through labor.  Never even saw her
                          son.

    Dr. Kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping.

                                KIDELL
                          My brother worked for the town
                          paper at the time.  He took this
                          picture of the funeral.

    Something in the clipping sparks Brenna's interest.

                                BRENNA
                          Have you spoken to anyone else
                          about this?

                                KIDELL
                          There was this one fella.  Asked
                          a lot of questions.  I was out
                          of town but I heard he spent near
                          a full day in the records office.

                                BRENNA
                          Would you remember his name?

                                KIDELL
                               (thinks)
                          Carl Smith.


30  INT. POLICE STATION                                             30

    A police line-up.

    Seven MEN, all dressed in Santa Claus outfits with bare legs,
    are paraded for a small, old LADY.

                                OFFICER
                          Just tell us when you see the one.

    Several rows back in the dark sits Brenna's UNCLE JOE, the
    district attorney, and another man, his ASSISTANT.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Forget it.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm just curious.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          You're never "just curious".
                               (to assistant)
                          You've met my neice, Brenna.

                                ASSISTANT
                          Hi Brenna.

                                OFFICER
                              (to line-up)
                          Number 5, lift your coat up more.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Aren't you getting a little old for
                          this?  You flunked out of law school.

                                BRENNA
                             (rolls her eyes)
                          Now there's a new topic.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Don't they have enough for you to
                          do at the castle?

    Brenna puts on her best little-girl angelic smile, a smile her
    uncle can never refuse.

                                UNCLE JOE
                                  (sighs)
                          Forgers do it all the time.  They
                          take the birth certificate of some-
                          one who died young and use it to
                          get legit I.D.  Usually they carry
                          it long enough to pass some bad
                          checks then dump it.

                                BRENNA
                          Thanks.

                                UNCLE JOE
                          Call your mother.  You never call her.

                                OFFICER
                              (to old lady)
                          Well?

                                OLD LADY
                          I don't know.  I'd have to see his
                          thing.


31  INT. BRENNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   31

    A swath of moonlight shines in across a carafe-turned-vase,
    a New England college diploma, and a police uniform hanging
    from the bedpost where Brenna lies with another man, DENNIS.

                                BRENNA
                          I can't figure out why he's doing it.
                          He's been Richard Taupin at least
                          since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You
                          should see the stuff he has in that shop.

                                DENNIS
                          Maybe he's hiding from something.

                                BRENNA
                          Some guy named Smith was asking
                          about him in Church Hill.  I passed
                          his name around with your buddies
                          downtown but they drew a blank.  So
                          he isn't a cop.  District anyway.

    Dennis gets out of bed and begins putting on his uniform.

                                DENNIS
                          Probably just some exec ducking
                          an ex-wife.

                                BRENNA
                          Dr. Kidell had a picture in his
                          file of the funeral.  The father
                          looked just like Richard.  Even had
                          a mark on his cheek.

                                DENNIS
                          How old is Richard?

                                BRENNA
                          P.D. says 41, but he barely looks
                          30.

                                DENNIS
                          Find the father.  That should clear
                          things up.

    He buttons his shirt.  Something occurs to him.

                                DENNIS
                          Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran
                          picked up the other night?

                                BRENNA
                          Yeah.

                                DENNIS
                          He'd want to know about all this.

                                BRENNA
                          Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his
                          own clues.  There's a journal article
                          in this somewhere.

                                DENNIS
                              (shakes head)
                          Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't
                          get the taste out of her mouth.

    Dennis puts on his police cap.

                                DENNIS
                          Well, the cream of society awaits.
                              (cocks hat to one side)
                          If you're ever in the neighborhood...

                                BRENNA
                          Sure.


32  EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT - NIGHT                                   32

    POLICE OFFICERS, their flashlights cutting the darkness, search
    the mud shores of a Potomac tidal basin.  The glowing Jefferson
    Memorial can be seen in the distance.

    DETECTIVE MORAN

    Is supervising.  An OFFICER climbs up the embankment to him.

                                OFFICER
                          They found it.

    The officer leads him down to the river where a headless BODY
    wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag.

                                OFFICER
                          It was about fifty yards down-
                          stream from the head.

    Moran looks down at the body bag, its dark plastic reflecting
    the rythmic rotation of squad car beacons.

                                OFFICER
                          Both were cut real clean.  Like the
                          other ones...


33  EXT. EQUESTRIAN RIDING GROUNDS - DAY                            33

    A steeple-chase course lies shrouded in an Arlington fog.

    Across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm
    breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle.  Driving the steed
    hard through the course, Taupin pulls firm on the reins,
    bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective
    Moran waits.

                                MORAN
                          There's been another murder.

    Taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline.

                                TAUPIN
                          My condolences.

                                MORAN
                          Where were you Tuesday night?

                                TAUPIN
                          Home.

                                MORAN
                          A neighbor saw your car leave.

                                TAUPIN
                          He's mistaken.

    Taupin climbs down from his horse.  Moran moves close.

                                MORAN
                          Look, I don't know what the hell
                          you're up to, but I think I've got
                          a pretty good idea.

                                TAUPIN
                          Do you?

                                MORAN
                          All I need is time.

                                TAUPIN
                          I've got all the time in the world.
                             (looks at watch)
                          Except right now.  If you will excuse
                          me, Lieutenant.

    In no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away.


34  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT                                 34

    Brenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful
    family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her
    desk corner.

    Boring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs.  From another
    folder she pulls out a computer sheet.

    INSERT COMPUTER SHEET

    The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record.
    Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and
    driving records.  Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in
    1967.

    Brenna looks down the list to a WILLIAM TAUPIN of Felton,
    Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the
    year Richard started.


35  EXT. GAS STATION - DAY                                          35

    Dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, Brenna
    removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware.


36  EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY                                            36

    Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary.

    Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade
    covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants.

    On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an
    open grave.

    Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit.

    A coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open
    and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: "WILLIAM
    MICHAEL TAUPIN".

    The casket is empty.

                                BRENNA
                          Someone beat you.

                                TAUPIN
                          Have you taken to touring small
                          town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?

                                BRENNA
                          Grave robbers?

                                TAUPIN
                          Probably.

                                BRENNA
                          Who?

                                TAUPIN
                          People like that rarely leave
                          business cards.

                                BRENNA
                          Does Carl Smith?

    A flash of interest, quickly suppressed.

                                TAUPIN
                          I don't know what you're talking
                          about.

                                BRENNA
                          I think you do.  Better yet, I don't
                          think anything was stolen because
                          nothing was there in the first place.
                          And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is,
                          now knows that.

                                TAUPIN
                          You have an active imagination.

                                BRENNA
                          I've been to Church Hill.

                                TAUPIN
                          Miss Cartwright, you are
                          involving yourself in
                          matters that do not concern
                          you.  I strongly suggest you
                          return to Washington and stay
                          out of small town cemetaries.

    He starts for the gate.

                                BRENNA
                          I could find him.

    Taupin stops.

                                BRENNA
                          I have friends.

                                TAUPIN
                          I doubt that.
                                 (beat)
                          Good day, Miss Cartwright.

    He walks on.

    After only a few paces Taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt
    stop.

                                BRENNA
                          What's wrong?

    He holds up an open palm to silence her.

                                TAUPIN
                          Your help may be unneccessary.

    The air is still.

    Taupin's face is expressionless.  He listens intently.  Sensing.

    An unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind.

                                VOICE
                                (o.s.)
                          Good afternoon, "Mr. Taupin".

    Taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad
    sword in hand.  We have never seen the knight out of his armor
    before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill.  Wearing
    Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive
    business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone.

    Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a
    marble wall.

                                KNIGHT
                          Long time.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not so long.

    The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.

                                TAUPIN
                          You've been here from the
                          start.

                                KNIGHT
                          My quarry grows clever with
                          age.  And the others, incompetent.

    The Knight throws Brenna a glance.

                                KNIGHT
                          Friend of yours?

                                TAUPIN
                          Of sorts.

                                KNIGHT
                          I do hope she enjoys a good
                          show.


    The Knight leans his whole body into a two-fisted swing,
    clanging out a chunk of marble as Taupin ducks.

    A second swipe also imbeds itself in stone.

                                KNIGHT
                          So now it ends.

    A thrust cuts only air.

                                KNIGHT
                          Generation upon generation.
                          Tens of thousands of miles.

    Taupin leaps behind a tree.  The Knight cuts it nearly in half.

                                KNIGHT
                          You're the last, MacLeod.
                          Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich,
                          those fools that followed
                          me, their heads all line my
                          shelf.  All but yours.

    Taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe.

                                KNIGHT
                          Can you feel it, MacLeod?
                          Can you _feel_ it!

    Taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the Knight on the knee,
    knocking him over.

    The Knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from
    Taupin.

                                KNIGHT
                          There can be but one.

    He raises his blade.

    An elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in
    the clearing.

                                WATCHMAN
                          Hey!  What's going on here?

    The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches
    his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest.

    Taupin pushes past him to Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Run!

    Brenna is frozen in shock.
    Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate.

                                TAUPIN
                          Run!

                                KNIGHT
                          MACLEOD!

    The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and
    lumbers after them.

    Taupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround-
    ing residential area.


37  EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY                                   37

    Taupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side-
    walk.

    They have apparently lost the Knight.  Taupin pauses at a
    corner.  He sees a church across the street.


38  INT. CHURCH                                                     38

    Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing
    echoing off the high ceiling.

    Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone.
    Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit-
    uation.

    Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and
    head against the back of the pew.

                                BRENNA
                          Jesus Christ.

                                TAUPIN
                          You'll be safe here.  He won't
                          kill in a church.

                                BRENNA
                          Why not?

                                TAUPIN
                              (distracted)
                          Tradition.

                                BRENNA
                          What the hell is going on?

    Taupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on
    his face.  He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the
    Church's doorway without a word.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


39  INT. MEDIEVAL BLACKSMITH SHOP                                   39

    A glowing horseshoe HISSES wildly as it slips into a wooden
    cooling bucket.  Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays
    it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet.

    Sweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside
    and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine.


40  EXT. SHOP FRONTAGE - DAY                                        40

    Conor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms,
    cleaning off a day's worth of sweat and grime.

    JUAN ROMIREZ

    Stirring up dust with his travelling boots, this Spanish acc-
    ented man stops at Conor's shop.  He wears a large broad sword
    strapped to his waist.

                                CONOR
                          Afternoon.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Your name is Conor?

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

                                ROMIREZ
                             (bows slightly)
                          Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief
                          surveyor and alchemist.

                                CONOR
                             (notices accent)
                          You're not from these
                          parts.

                                ROMIREZ
                          I am from Spain.  And I
                          would like a moment of
                          your time.


41  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               41

    Romirez is seated at a table.  His back to the Spaniard,
    Conor is preparing some food.

                                CONOR
                          I haven't much to offer,
                          Mr. Romirez from Spain,
                          but you're welcome to what's
                          here.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Please go to no trouble.

    Romirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that
    runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Your back, it would seem
                          perhaps you were injured
                          in battle?

                                CONOR
                          Five years past me clan
                          fought another over some-
                          thing I cannot even re-

                          Your marks would suggest
                          great injury.

                                CONOR
                          I was nearly killed.

                                ROMIREZ
                          But you lived.

    Conor looks up from his work in pained memory.

                                CONOR
                          I did at that.

                                ROMIREZ
                          And but for a mark you are
                          well as any man, no?

                                CONOR
                          Aye.

                                ROMIREZ
                          I should imagine that your
                          recovery must have alarmed
                          your fellow villagers, perhaps
                          giving them reason to invent
                          an explanation.  And a solution.

    Something isn't right.
    Conor turns and faces him.

                                CONOR
                          I was driven out.

                                ROMIREZ
                          And now you live in a small
                          village miles away from all
                          you knew.

                                CONOR
                          How can you know this?

                                ROMIREZ
                             (tone lightens)
                          First food, no?  A good meal
                          makes conversation so much
                          easier.

    Stunned with the implications of what Romirez has said, like
    a robot Conor serves the meal.  His eyes never leave Romirez,
    who digs hungrily into the food.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Hmm, que rico.  What is it you
                          call this?

                                CONOR
                          Pheasant.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You Scots have a way with
                          game.  It still has life in it.
                          Spirit.  Back home the food
                          is so...domestic.

                                CONOR
                          Why are you here?

                                ROMIREZ
                          I was sent by his majesty of
                          Spain to Inverness as a con-
                          sultant on matters of metal.

                                CONOR
                          You're a long way from Inverness.

                                ROMIREZ
                          In my travels I heard the story of
                          the MacLeod boy struck down and
                          brought from the hand of
                          death by powers not of this Earth.

                                CONOR
                          You know me home.  Me name.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It was time for our paths to cross.

    Romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You see this?

    He traces some discoloration on his arm.

                                ROMIREZ
                          When I was a boy a cart driven
                          by a drunken fool crushed me.  All
                          thought I would die or be maimed
                          for life.  But I healed quickly.
                          And like you I paid the price
                          for being different.

                                CONOR
                          You are the same?

                                ROMIREZ
                          Do you ever feel a flow, as if some-
                          thing were pushing against you?

                                CONOR
                          Yes.  Always.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Does it change with me in the room?

                                CONOR
                          It is less.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You feel you know me.

                                CONOR
                          I don't know why.

                                ROMIREZ
                          We are brothers.


42  EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

    Romirez and Conor walk alone amongst torch-lit hutches.

                                CONOR
                          He told me there could be only
                          one.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Some cling to sanity through time
                          with the one continuity and trad0
                          ition their lives have known: The
                          Game.
                               (Conor confused)
                          You and I Conor, we are different
                          from all others around us.  You
                          know this, you can feel it.  We are
                          flesh and bone like any man, but
                          unlike our neighbors we are rather
                          difficult to injure,
                               (looks away)
                          permanently.

                                CONOR
                          I don't understand.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You are still so very young.

                                CONOR
                          I'm twenty-two.

                                ROMIREZ
                              (shakes head)
                          Not even a single lifetime.

    Romirez chooses his words very carefully.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Conor, you and I, we cannot be
                          killed.

                                CONOR
                          What?

                                ROMIREZ
                          We are immortal.

    Stunned, Conor backs away from Romirez.

                                CONOR
                          No, that can't be.

    Romirez grasps Conor's shoulder.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It is as you are.

                                CONOR
                             (pushes away)
                          No!

    This is all too much for Conor.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Listen to me.  Hear the words.

                                CONOR
                          This is madness!

                                ROMIREZ
                          It is the truth.

                                CONOR
                          No!

    Romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's
    heart.  The boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his
    eyes roll up into his head.

    A shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the
    ground.

    Brenna stops her car in front of the Washington Police Depart-

    After a moment of indecision she changes her mind and returns

    Brenna lowers herself wearily into a chair, rubs her eyes,
    and stares absently out the window.

    Reaching across to an end table, she plays back her answering

     This HISS of Brenna's answering machine becomes the HISS of
     cooking.  Bandaged about the chest, Conor asleep on his
     cot.

     Suddenly he sits up.  Sweating.  He looks about the room in
     confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Three days you've laid there.

                          hell for all eternity.

                          What is to become of me?  Am I to

                          Far or near.  But if I were to die
                          the push would become stronger
                          than ever before.  There is power
                          in this.  And as long as you and I
                          live, The Knight can never have
                          it all.

                                CONOR
                          But we cannot be killed.

                                ROMIREZ
                          There is an imperfection.  For all
                          your healing, if your head ever
                          leaves your neck, you are dead.
                          You can survive anything but steel
                          against your threat.  Then it is
                          over.  The end.

                                CONOR
                          How can I stop such a man?

                          Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth
                          till you learn.  You must learn to
                          defend yourself.  In this I can help.

                                CONOR
                          Why?

                                ROMIREZ
                          We are brothers.  And you are a
                          defense-
                                 (beat)
                          -of sorts.


47  EXT. PENNSYLVANIA FARMHOUSE - DAY                               47

    An old man, MR. NORTH, leads Taupin up the drive of a rural
    farmhouse somewhere in the hinterland of Pennsylvania.

                                MR. NORTH
                          When your father died I saw to
                          it that the grounds were kept up.

                                TAUPIN
                          The money in the estate was
                          enough to cover your costs?

                                MR. NORTH
                          Oh yes, more than enough.


48  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                  48

    Furniture clad in white sheets.  Dust everywhere.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Most of the furniture was put
                          into protective storage.  I'll
                          have some boys come up and clean
                          the place out for you.

    Taupin drags a finger across a dusty window pane.

                                MR. NORTH
                               (fascinated)
                          You're one of William's kids,
                          huh?

                                TAUPIN
                          His only kid.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Sure take after him.  Never seen
                          a father and son look more alike.

                                TAUPIN
                          We were very close.

                                MR. NORTH
                          The resemblance is amazing.

                                TAUPIN
                          When may I expect the cleaners?

                                MR. NORTH
                          I'll send them right up.


49  INT. "O'REILY'S" - NIGHT                                        49

    Coupled strangers gyrate under colored lights and recorded music.

    Brenna sits alone.  Whatever nervousness she brought through the
    door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by
    the three empty glasses in front of her.

    A MAN

    With something less than perfect coordination, sits down beside
    her.

                                MAN
                          That stuff'll put you away if
                          you're not careful.

                                BRENNA
                          There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He
                          would invite the local peasants to
                          his chateau, fill them full of wine,
                          then slice their bellies so he
                          could reuse it.
                                (smiles)
                          The symmetry of that somehow always
                          appealed to me.

                                MAN
                          You're very macabre.

                                BRENNA
                          It's my birthday.

                                MAN
                          Happy birthday.

                                BRENNA
                          Thanks.

    Brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh.

                                BRENNA
                          Buy a birthday girl a drink?


50  INT. PUB - NIGHT                                                50

    A small neighborhood tavern.  Regulars chat amicably with the
    BARTENDER-OWNER.

    TAUPIN

    Sits alone at a corner table.  A WAITRESS hovers over him.

                                TAUPIN
                          Lager and lime.

    LATER

    Taupin's lager is drained.  Lost in thought, he drags a finger
    around and around the lip of the mug.

    He hand stops.  It twitches.  Shakes.

    Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly
    out of control.  A warning.

    He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing
    over him.

                                KAHN
                          MacLeod.

    Taupin is anxious, poised for attack.

    Kahn breaks into a broad smile.

                                KAHN
                          Spare a chair?

                                TAUPIN
                          Kahn?

                                KAHN
                          Are you going to offer me a chair
                          or leave me standing here all night?

                                TAUPIN
                          Sit.

    Kahn takes his place across the table.

                                TAUPIN
                               (unsure)
                          How are you?

                                KAHN
                          Head still secure to the neck.

                                TAUPIN
                          How did you find me?

                                KAHN
                          How many places this side of the
                          Atlantic serve lager and lime?

    Taupin looks to his own glass.

                                KAHN
                          Old habits die hard.
                              (to waitress)
                          Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!
                                 (beat)
                          Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the
                          closest thing they stock to my side
                          of the fence.

                                TAUPIN
                          What are you doing here?

                                KAHN
                          It is the gathering, my friend.  The
                          settling of old scores.

    Taupin tenses.

                                TAUPIN
                          And have you something to settle
                          with me?

                                KAHN
                               (smiles)
                          Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink
                          with an old friend.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's good to see you, Kahn.

    The waitress sets down two glasses.

                                KAHN
                          Come, toast with me the past.
                              (raises glass)
                          To old conquests, old loves, and to a
                          time when we cared about either.

    Kahn drains his glass.

                                KAHN
                          Waitress!


51  EXT. THE WASHINGTON MALL - NIGHT                                51

    Kahn and Taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed
    government building.

                                KAHN
                          I'll never forget the look on that
                          Papal commander's face when his
                          "heretic stronghold" turned out to
                          be a rock full of whores climbing
                          all over Neuvich.

                                TAUPIN
                          Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.

                                KAHN
                          But then rides up Pope Pius who
                          calmly brushes the dust from his
                          papal cross, climbs off his papal
                          horse, draws his papal sword and
                          asks just what the hell is going
                          on.  And what did Neuvich, dear
                          dear drunken Neuvich do?

                                TAUPIN
                          Offered the Pope one of his whores.

    They LAUGH.

    A JOGGER stops on the gravel and listens to the strange conversation.

                                TAUPIN
                          Had a great swing with his blade.
                          For a Pope.

                                KAHN
                                (sighs)
                          Good times then.  A man could
                          stretch his legs without bring-
                          ing half the world down around
                          his ears.  Not like now.

    The jogger shakes his head and runs on.

                                TAUPIN
                               (serious)
                          He found us even there.

                                KAHN
                          He always did.


52  EXT. ZOO - NIGHT                                                52

    A CLINKING of chain link as Taupin and Kahn climb a fence and
    tumble into the Washington Zoo.

                                TAUPIN
                          I haven't drunk this much since-

                                KAHN
                          -Since you last saw me.

    Kahn chucks an empty wine bottle.  An unspecified animal GROWLS
    sleepily somewhere in the darkness.

                                KAHN
                          Come on.

53  EXT. DISPLAY AREA - NIGHT                                       53

    Taupin and Kahn stumble through an open-air display of Asian
    animals.  Their VOICES seem to echo everywhere.

                                KAHN
                          I love zoos.  Ever since I was
                          a kid.

                                TAUPIN
                          You were never a kid.

    Kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen.

                                KAHN
                             (points at one)
                          I knew his great-grandfather.

                                TAUPIN
                          You're insane.

                                KAHN
                          No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool
                          together in Rangoon.

                                TAUPIN
                          How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you
                          live so full of life for so long?

                                KAHN
                          Tasting and enjoying life is the
                          only thing of value we have.  All
                          else is just marking time.
                               (beat)
                          You're marking time.

                                TAUPIN
                          I've had a few more concerns.

    Kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath.

                                KAHN
                          The pressure only comes when you
                          let the taste slip into your mouth.

                                TAUPIN
                          You're wrong.

                                KAHN
                          You don't run as hard, MacLeod.
                          You just don't run as hard anymore.


54  INT. O'REILY'S - NIGHT                                          54

    Late.  The bar is nearly empty.

    No sign of the Knight.  Brenna looks at her watch, sighs, and
    drops a bill onto the counter.


55  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             55

    Brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit
    street.

    She hears something and turns.

    -Nothing.  A breeze rustles the trees above.

    After only a few more paces she hears something again.
    Brenna abruptly turns.

    -Right into the face of THE KNIGHT.

    Brenna SCREAMS.  The Knight reaches into his leather carrying bag.

    A GROUP OF NOISY TEENAGERS

    Exit a facing townhouse.  The Knight removes his hand from the
    bag as they spill onto the sidewalk LAUGHING and YELLING.

    Brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner.
    The Knight follows at a measured distance.

    At the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off.
    Brenna bolts into the intersection.  Weaving through SCREECHING
    brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors.


56  INT. BUILDING                                                   56

    40 well dressed PATRONS, numbered cards pinned to their lapels,
    sit in velvetly plush surroundings.  At the front of the room
    stands a thin moustached art AUCTIONEER.

    Brenna BUSTLES in from outside.

                                AUCTIONEER
                          I apoligize for the lateness of the
                          hour, but I'm sure you will all agree
                          the quality of this year's collection
                          is well worth the time.

    The Knight BURSTS in with his leather carrying bag.  Brenna
    slides along the draped back wall to avoid him.

                                AUCTIONEER
                             (holding statuette)
                          For this fine example of medieval
                          religious art, let us open the bid
                          at 4,000 dollars.

    The Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry.

                                AUCTIONEER
                          10,500 once, 10,500 twice...

    Brenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a SECURITY
    GUARD..

                                AUCTIONEER
                             (points at Brenna)
                          11,000.  A bid at 11,000.

                                BRENNA
                          No, I-

    The guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her
    very officially.

    Being closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across
    the room to a fire exit, setting off an ALARM as she flies open
    the door.

    The Knight leaps after her, knocking over an OLD WOMAN in the
    front row.


57  EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                           57

    Brenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a Metro station.


58  INT. METRO STATION                                              58

    Brenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car
    just as the doors shut.

    THE KNIGHT

    is also now on the platform but can only watch Brenna through
    a window as the train pulls away.


59  EXT. TAUPIN'S TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                   59

    Brenna KNOCKS at the front door.  No answer.

    She KNOCKS harder.  The unlatched door pushes open.


60  INT. TOWNHOUSE                                                  60

    Brenna stands in the doorway.

    Before her is a disaster.  Furniture has been smashed like
    matchsticks.  A desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on
    the floor.

    Brenna enters slowly.

                                BRENNA
                          Mr. Taupin?  I have to talk to
                          you.

    Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken.

    Brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers.
    She comes across an old black and white photograph.  Badly
    streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm-
    house.  Written in the corner is "Worstick, 1928".

    Brenna slips the photo into her pocket.  Standing, she turns
    smack into Taupin.

                                TAUPIN
                          Finished?

    He looks past her to the destruction of his living room.  It
    doesn't seem to surprise him.

                                BRENNA
                          He tried to kill me last night.

                                TAUPIN
                          Where?

                                BRENNA
                          Dupont Circle.

    Taupin sifts through the debris, selecting articles from it.

                                BRENNA
                          Who is he?

                                TAUPIN
                          At the moment?  Carl Smith.

                                BRENNA
                          And you?

    He ignores the question.

                                BRENNA
                          What will you do now?

                                TAUPIN
                          You needn't worry Miss Cartwright.
                          I've been at this a very long time.

                                BRENNA
                          He called you "MacLeod".

                                TAUPIN
                          Not your concern.

                                BRENNA
                          I left a man dead in
                          Felton.  But you don't
                          really care, do you?

                                TAUPIN
                          That bothers you?

                                BRENNA
                          He was innocent.

                                TAUPIN
                          He's dead.  Whatever I may
                          or may not feel means
                          exceedingly little to him
                          now.

                                BRENNA
                          What about me?

                                TAUPIN
                          You?

                                BRENNA
                          I'm a witness to a murder.  That
                          seems to put me pretty high
                          on your friend's chop list.

                                TAUPIN
                          Have you gone to the
                          police?

                                BRENNA
                          No.

                                TAUPIN
                          Why not?  I'm sure they'd
                          love to hear your story.

                                BRENNA
                          I'd rather hear yours.

                                TAUPIN
                                (beat)
                          You are being foolish.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin.
                          Only once in a lifetime do you
                          stare history in the face.

                                TAUPIN
                          Go home.

    He walks to the doorway.

                                BRENNA
                          Why does he want to kill you?

    Taupin stops, his back to her.

                                TAUPIN
                          He sees me as a threat.

                                BRENNA
                          Are you?

    Taupin walks out the door.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


61  EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - DAY                                         61

    On a clear rise above the village Romirez and Conor spar with
    swords covered in heavy cloth.  Conor is having difficulty.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Concentrate!

    Conor thrusts.  Romirez blocks.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Harder.  Concentrate harder.

                                CONOR
                          Me arm hurts.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Again.  Try again.

    Conor strikes.  Romirez easily blocks.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Harder!  You swing like an impotent
                          cow!

                                CONOR
                          Go to hell.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Oh, the boy has a mouth,
                          now if only he had an arm.

    Ticked off, Conor leans himself into a two-fisted swing.
    Romirez knocks it aside, but Conor recovers faster than he,
    knocking Romirez flat on his back.

                                CONOR
                          Impotent cow.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Muy Bien!

    Conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face.

    Romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled
    from his belt.  He offers it to Conor.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Here my boy, from vineyards
                          as sweet and smooth as a young
                          girl's thigh.

    Conor accepts the cup.  Romirez pulls himself to his feet.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It will take less effort
                          as you learn.

                                CONOR
                          It's like to kill me first.

    Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You have a gift.  One you
                          must protect.

                                CONOR
                          And what is this great
                          gift that cannot be seen
                          or smelt?

                                ROMIREZ
                          The Fabric of life.  The spark
                          that allows the passing of
                          existence from one generation
                          to another.

                                CONOR
                              (shakes head)
                          If that was meant to be an ex-
                          planation Mr. Romirez from Spain,
                          I'm afraid you've failed.

    Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Come.  Enough sword play for an
                          afternoon.


62  EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                          62

    A friendly horse race.  Their reflections bouncing off a clear
    glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen
    tree trunks.

    Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait
    for Romirez, several lengths behind.

                                CONOR
                           (as Romirez rides up)
                          You're no match for Scot, Mr.
                          Romirez.  We're raised as riders.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.

    Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view.  Romirez pulls a
    leaf from a tree and studies it closely.

                                CONOR
                          What is the fascinatioon?  It is only
                          a leaf.

                                ROMIREZ
                          All living things pay dues,
                          Conor.  They must be respected
                          for that.

    He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one.

                                ROMIREZ
                          As they age they contribute to a
                          sum that is the kindling from which
                          all future life comes.  To feel it,
                          to know it, is to be in touch with
                          the will of every living thing.

                                CONOR
                          I do not think I like the sound
                          of that.

                                ROMIREZ
                          It does not feel nearly as frightening
                          as it sounds.  But the consequences of
                          such feelings can be very frightening.
                          For it gives you great strength.  The
                          strength of _knowledge_.  The ability
                          to stand between the giving of what
                          has always been to what will always
                          be.

                                CONOR
                          I feel hardly nothing.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You have not been fully trained.
                          But you will learn.  And you will be
                          good, I can feel that.  You have apt-
                          itude.  This is why our friend is
                          so concerned.

                                CONOR
                          But why be so concerned about me?

                                ROMIREZ
                          This power is divided amongst you,
                          me, and others like cuts in a pie.
                          But the cuts are not equal.  Some,
                          like you and he, have more.  Much
                          more.

                                CONOR
                          And you?

                                ROMIREZ
                          I am a small player.  But if by
                          helping you I can keep that monster
                          from being the last, then perhaps
                          my life has meant something.

                                CONOR
                          I am not ready for this.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You must be.  You have responsibilities.
                          You must learn the rules.  You can never
                          attract attention to yourself, never
                          show the side that will draw others to
                          you.  You will always know when you are
                          in the presence of another.  Beware.
                          But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will
                          be your battle against time.  In the
                          coming years you will see kingdoms rise
                          then rot like wheat.  People will
                          become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The
                          only constant you will know will be
                          the others and the tradition their
                          greed and quest represent.  But life
                          without morality, without the ability
                          to truly taste the sweetness of wine
                          and love, is no life at all.  That is
                          how the others exist.  Nothing more
                          than walking corpses living only to
                          slaughter each other in an insane quest
                          to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed
                          to the earth.  Do not become one of them.

                                CONOR
                          Of course.

                                ROMIREZ
                          You are young, inexperienced.  You
                          do not know what time can do.  How
                          it can sap all pity, all love.

                                CONOR
                          That is not me.

                                ROMIREZ
                          With the proper tools, Conor, a
                          naive man can be much more dangerous
                          than an evil one.

                                VILLAGER
                          Conor!

    A VILLAGER approaches from across the pasture.

                                CONOR
                          Yes, Darin.

                                VILLAGER
                          Hate to be bothering you like this,
                          but me mare threw a shoe.

    Conor looks to Romirez.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Go ahead, Senor.
                              (gestures to wine)
                          I have my friend to keep me company.

                                CONOR
                          I'll be back when I can.

    Conor sets off across the pasture.


64  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               64

    Romirez enters and flops onto a cot.
    Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed
    and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing.

    The room is still.
    Romirez begins to drowse.

    Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness.
    His hand moves under the cot.

    With an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges
    and splintered into fragments.  Passing through a cloud of
    sawdust enters the Knight.  Without pause he topples a kitchen
    shelf onto a supine Romirez.

                                KNIGHT
                          Romirez.  What a surprise.

    Romirez is struggling under the debris.
    The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg.
    The limb is severed.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Madonna!

    The Knight begins casting aside the shelving.
    With lightning speed Romirez pulls the sword from beneath the
    bed and hammers it deep into the Knight's side.

                                KNIGHT
                          Bastard!

    He crashes back against the wall.

    Romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword
    as a crutch.

    The Knight has regained a meager balance on his knees.
    Blood pours from the slice in his stomach,

    Romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into
    the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing.

                                ROMIREZ
                          Oh, Santa Maria!

    The Knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees
    beside Romirez.

                                KNIGHT
                          Why run?

                                ROMIREZ
                          Demonio!

    The Knight's trembling hands raise his shaking sword high.

                                KNIGHT
                          To hell with you.


65  EXT. BARNYARD - DAY                                             65

    Conor pounds at a horseshoe.

    The hammer slips from his grasp as he slumps forward as if
    pushed.


66  EXT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY                                         66

    Badly wounded, the Knight staggers through the shattered
    doorway and tumbles into the street.

    A CHILD SCREAMS.

    Pulling himself up, the Knight hobbles away.


67  EXT. - DAY                                                      67

    Conor is running through the village.


67  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               67

    Conor rushes in and shudders to a stop.

    An entire wall is showered with blood.
    Conor walks slowly forward.  Dazed.

    As he looks down something takes his attention.

    It is Romirez's severed head.

    Conor moans in anguish and drops to his knees on the blood-
    stained floor.

    His head sinks to his chest as he begins sobbing.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


68  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH LIBRARY                                    68

    Somewhere in the bowels of the museum, the RESEARCH
    LIBRARIAN, a wiry young man, sits at his cluttered desk.
    Brenna looms above him.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          Come on Brenna, your ass
                          is already in a sling, don't
                          drag me into it.

                                BRENNA
                          All I need is for you
                          to check the name.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          You talked to your supervisor
                          lately?  He's burning up the
                          place about you just dropping
                          out of sight.  That on top of
                          the cops bugging him.

                                BRENNA
                          I'll take care of that
                          Corey, but I need this now.

    The librarian looks her over skeptically.

                                BRENNA
                          Corey, you _owe_ me.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          It's that important?

                                BRENNA
                          Yeah.

    The librarian reluctantly reaches for his keys.


69  INT. STORAGE AREA                                               69

    Holding Brenna's photograph, the research librarian is comb-
    ing through stained binders.  The room is old, disorganized,
    and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must
    be in it somewhere.

                                RESEARCHER
                          Wilson know about this?

                                BRENNA
                          I'm doing it on my own.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          Good way to lose your job.

                                BRENNA
                          Some job.  Card filing and
                          cabinet dusting.  Four years
                          in this dump and I haven't
                          written anything for Wilson
                          that a wounded yak couldn't
                          do.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          I liked the bit you did
                          about Baltic chastity belts.
                          Too bad no one else did.

                                BRENNA
                          It's bullshit.  Everything.
                          My job, the people I get
                          involved with, I'm up to here
                          with it.

                                LIBRARIAN
                          You always were hard to
                          impress.

    The librarian pulls a binder and opens it.

                                BRENNA
                          Who is it?

                                LIBRARIAN
                          Not who.  What.  Worstick's
                          a town in Pennsylvania.


70  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH OFFICE                                     70

    Brenna enters and sits at her desk.  She is looking for
    something.

                                BRENNA
                              (confused)
                          Chris, have you seen my
                          notebook?

    Chris is seated at the desk next to her.  He points at the
    supervisor's door.

                                BRENNA
                          Why, that son of a bitch.


71  INT. MUSEUM SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE                                 71

    The high backed office chair is spun away from an angry,
    entering Brenna.

                                BRENNA
                          What's wrong Wilson, huh?  Not enough
                          excitement in your own desk?  What the
                          hell were you looking for in mine?

    The chair turns.  Detective Moran, not her supervisor, leafs
    through her notebook.

                                MORAN
                          A murder.

                                BRENNA
                          You better have a warrant.  That's
                          my notebook, you've got no right
                          to be sticking your fingers into it.

                                MORAN
                          I've got a morgue filling up with
                          bodies.  That's my right.

                                BRENNA
                          What do you want from me?

                                MORAN
                          Well, the man of the hour that we
                          all would like to talk to about now
                          has apparently skipped town.
                             (looks at notebook)
                          And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's
                          ambulence chaser is an expert on
                          missing persons.

    Brenna lifts the telephone receiver.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm calling an attorney.

                                MORAN
                          You and I should talk first.

                                BRENNA
                          We've got nothing to say.

    Moran presses the post on the phone.

                                MORAN
                          What are you going to tell them?  That
                          you're protecting a man who's
                          killed four people?

                                BRENNA
                          Four?

                                MORAN
                          All fashionably without heads.

                                BRENNA
                          Spare me the details.

                                MORAN
                          But there's more.  Wednesday someone
                          played javelin with the cemetary
                          curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some
                          locals spotted two cars with D.C.
                          plates and surprise surprise, they
                          turn out to be registered to our
                          own Brenna Cartwright and the ever
                          popular Richard Taupin.

                                BRENNA
                          What are you getting at, Moran?

                                MORAN
                          You've been a busy little beaver.
                          Especially with that records mess
                          up in Church Hill.
                             (looks at notebook)
                          Your notes are very complete.
                          Naturally my feelings were crushed
                          when you didn't rush right over
                          and tell us what you knew.
                             (looks up)
                          In fact, we're considering book-
                          ing the ambulence chaser as an
                          accessory to murder.

                                BRENNA
                          It'll never stick.

                                MORAN
                          But we might just give it the
                          'ole college try.  What with the
                          court back ups, it could be days
                          before you got an arraignment.
                          But then, I'm sure the flunk-out
                          neice of the D.A. knows all about
                          that.

                                BRENNA
                          You're an asshole, Moran.

                                MORAN
                          I want Taupin.

                                BRENNA
                          What makes you so sure he's
                          the one?

                                MORAN
                          Just for laughs we raided wonder
                          boy's house.  There was a gallon
                          of one of the corpse's blood in
                          his carpet.  I think it was about
                          then I withdrew his name for
                          humanitarian of the year.

                                BRENNA
                          What's all of this got to do
                          with me?

                                MORAN
                          What were you doing in Felton?

                                BRENNA
                          Research.  If your pal was there
                          I never saw him.

                                MORAN
                          I have witnesses that can put
                          the two of you together.

                                BRENNA
                            (knows he's bluffing)
                          Never take up poker, Detective.

                                MORAN
                          Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck
                          can be sliced as fast as anyone
                          else's.

    Brenna reaches across and lifts her notebook.

                                BRENNA
                          Why don't you wait until it comes
                          out in paperback?

    Moran watches her leave.  He lifts the telephone receiver.

    RESEARCH OFFICE

    Striding out into the corridor, Brenna passes Dennis, the cop
    from her bedroom, leaning against the doorway.

                                DENNIS
                          I warned you.

                                BRENNA
                          Go to hell.


72  INT. CHURCH (WASHINGTON D.C.)                                   72

    A PRIEST celebrates mass in a present-day cathedral.

    In the rear of the church apart from the other PARISHIONERS
    sits the Knight.  As the priest leads the parishioners through
    the procession of faith, the Knight alone repeats it quietly
    to himself in Latin, the ancient language of the church.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


73  EXT. ABANDONED GRAVEYARD - DAY                                  73

    Crooked tombstones strewn across the bleached ground of a place
    not beloning to reality.

    In full medieval tartan, Conor stands against a forceful wind.

    CRACKS

    Run the length plain, spewing forth steam and staggering
    SKELETONS.  There are dozens of them, all carrying their skulls
    under one arm.

    The skeletons press forward and trap Conor against the trunk
    of a dead oak.  The heads break into harsh, demonic LAUGHTER.
    Conor puts his hands over his ears in pain as the bodies push
    forward.

    SCREAMING, he disappears under a mass of gleaming bones.

                                                        CUT TO:


74  INT. TAUPIN'S WORSTICK HOME                                     74

    Taupin wakes from the dream with a SHOUT.
    He has fallen asleep in a desk chair.

    Taupin walks to a window and looks out to the green hills.  To
    the distance.


75  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           75

    Brenna's sedan shoots down a country highway.


76  INT. SEDAN - DAY                                                76

    Checking her rear view mirror, Brenna notices two suspicious
    FIGURES in a car behind her.


77  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           77

    Brenna pulls to the side.  The car from behind passes without
    incident.


78  INT. SEDAN - DAY                                                78

    Brenna is driving again.  Listening now to the RADIO, she
    casts a glance in the mirror.  The same car is behind her.


79  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                           79

    Passing over a rise in the highway, Brenna turns abruptly
    onto a service road and behind a group of trees.

    THE OTHER CAR

    Pauses a moment at the intersection, then drives on.


80  EXT. STOREFRONT - DAY                                           80

    Brenna shows the PROPRIETOR the photograph.  He explains
    something to her.

    Brenna steps outside the store onto the Main Street of the
    very small community of Worstick.

    AT A STREET CORNER

    Brenna passes a small monument settled in a flower bed.  It has
    a plaque memorializing five locals murdered in 1931.


81  INT. SEDAN                                                      81

    A mile out of town Brenna stops at a farmhouse.  She checks
    it against the photo she found at Taupin's townhouse.  They
    match.


82  EXT. FARMHOUSE DOOR - DAY                                       82

    Brenna KNOCKS.

                                TAUPIN
                          You shouldn't have come.

    Brenna whirls around and sees Taupin behind her.

                                TAUPIN
                          We're you followed?

    He looks to the road.

                                BRENNA
                          No.

                                TAUPIN
                          No one knows you're here?

                                BRENNA
                          No.  I had to talk to you.

                                TAUPIN
                          You had to do _nothing_!

                                BRENNA
                          You're wrong.

                                TAUPIN
                          You're a fool.

                                BRENNA
                          Maybe.

    Pause.  Taupin strides through the doorway.

                                TAUPIN
                          Come inside.


83  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                  83

    Brenna and Taupin enter.  A heavy broad sword sits on the
    coffee table.

                                BRENNA
                          Is this what you killed them with?

                                TAUPIN
                          You've been listening to rumors.

                                BRENNA
                          Our cars were seen together in
                          Felton.  They're calling me an
                          accessory to murder.

                                TAUPIN
                          You are.  Now.

    Beat.  They're stuck with each other.

                                TAUPIN
                          There's several bedrooms down the
                          hall.  Take your pick.


84  INT. BEDROOM                                                    84

    The room is a strange decor.  18th century paintings hang
    beside grotesque medieval carvings.

    Brenna's face softens with worry.  What is she doing?


85  EXT. RURAL PAY PHONE - DAY                                      85

    A plain-clothed POLICE OFFICER is in mid conversation.

                                OFFICER
                          No, that's the last place we saw
                          her.  Okay, will do.

    He hangs up.

                                PARTNER
                          Well?

                                OFFICER
                                (shrugs)
                          We keep looking.

                                PARTNER
                          Wonderful.


86  INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            86

    Taupin sits at his desk.  Before him is spread out blank birth
    certificates, driver licenses and title deeds.  His eyes lift
    to the corridor where Brenna is.  An idea has come to him.

    Brenna enters.

                                BRENNA
                          What's all that?

                                TAUPIN
                          Richard Taupin has become
                          cumbersome.  It would be best
                          if he just disappeared.

    Brenna walks to the window.

                                BRENNA
                          You did kill those men.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not all of them.

                                BRENNA
                          When you finish, what then?

                                TAUPIN
                          I go my way and you can write
                          all you want about the big bad
                          Mr. Taupin.

                                BRENNA
                          You make it all sound so simple.

                                TAUPIN
                          The only real difficulty comes
                          in changing over the ownership
                          of property I've aquired.  That
                          requires certain records and
                          most importantly a personal
                          appearance at the county seat in
                          Gettysburg.  But that's where
                          you come in.

                                BRENNA
                          You want me to front for you.

                                TAUPIN
                          The less exposure I recieve
                          around government buildings the
                          better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin,
                          will attract considerably less
                          attention than I.

    Brenna is unsure.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not such a bad trade.  The story
                          of a lifetime for a few days
                          work?


87  INT. TAUPIN'S WASHINGTON TOWNHOUSE                              87

    Detective Moran looks through the broken remains of the living
    room.

    An INSPECTOR enters.

                                INSPECTOR
                          They lost her outside of Thurmont.

    Moran sighs and tosses a piece of wood on the pile of debris.

                                MORAN
                          I want people in here to check
                          over every piece of this stuff.

                                INSPECTOR
                          Figure she's with him?

                                MORAN
                          Yeah.

                                INSPECTOR
                          We ran down that Church Hill info.
                          She's right.  There is no Richard
                          Taupin.

                                MORAN
                          Any other I.D.s come up?

                                INSPECTOR
                          Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday.
                          Thompson's going to try CIA
                          this afternoon.
                                 (shrugs)
                          Y'never know.

    Moran rises and dons his coat.

                                MORAN
                          Should have seen him the first
                          night.  Son of a bitch stood there
                          with a quart of blood on his
                          pant leg and didn't even blink.

                                INSPECTOR
                          You'd think he'd had practice.

    Moran walks to the door.

                                MORAN
                          I think he has.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


88  EXT. FRENCE MILITARY CAMP - DAY                                 88

    Conor, now MAJOR DUPONT of the French infantry, pours over
    battle plans.

    An AIDE, dressed as Conor-Dupont in 18th century European
    military garb, enters the command area.

                                AIDE
                          The men are assembled, Major.

    A GENERAL stands beside the major.

                                GENERAL
                          See that they are indeed ready,
                          Dupont.

                                DUPONT (CONOR)
                          Yes General.


89  EXT. PARADE GROUND - DAY                                        89

    A regiment of INFANTRYMEN, pale blue coat tails tossing in
    the light breeze, stand at attention.

    A STAFF SARGEANT presents the men to Dupont.

                                STAFF SARGEANT
                          Regiment ready for review, sir.

    Dupont walks past the sargeant to the line.

                                DUPONT
                              (to soldier)
                          Stand straight, you are a soldier
                          of the King.

                                SOLDIER #1
                          Yes sir.

    Dupont continues down the line.  Another soldier's infantry
    jacket is almost hilariously mis-buttoned, one collar sticking
    up four inches higher than the other.

    Dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying
    brass buttons onto the ground.

    He moves on.

                                DUPONT
                              (to soldier)
                          Where is your bayonet?

                                SOLIDER #3
                          Lost it sir.

                                DUPONT
                          Where?

    The soldier hedges.

                                STAFF SARGEANT
                          You heard the Major!  Where!

                                SOLDIER #3
                          Whorehouse sir.

    Dupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens.

                                DUPONT
                          Your rifle.  Hand it to me.

    The soldier obeys.  Dupont inspects the firing mechanism.

                                DUPONT
                          The flint is cracked.  No spark
                          will reach your powder.  You will
                          die tomorrow.

    He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands.

                                DUPONT
                          Tomorrow you go to _battle_!  And
                          you look like children!
                                (beat)
                          The General has charged me with
                          seeing that you are prepared, and
                          prepared you will be!  If necessary
                          you stand here all night!  Sargeant!

    The sargeant leaps to attention.

                                SARGEANT
                          Yes sir.

                                DUPONT
                          See to it.

                                SARGEANT
                          Yes sir.

    Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some-
    thing.  He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen.

    His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking
    each face carefully.

    One PRIVATE seizes his attention.  The private is cautious.

                                DUPONT
                          Your name?

                                MULET
                          Mulet.

    It is as if Dupont knows him.  The two stare at each other.
    Dupont turns and leaves.


90  INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                          90

    Inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters,
    Dupont (Conor) and several others eat their evening meal.

    A CAPTAIN finishes his story.

                                CAPTAIN
                                (amused)
                          ...And what a sight!  That old
                          mare just kept falling over her
                          own guts till someone finally
                          shot her.

    The OFFICERS LAUGH.  All but Dupont.

                                MAJOR
                              (beside Dupont)
                          Complete your inspection?

                                DUPONT
                          They're nothing but boys.  It
                          will be a slaughter tomorrow.

                                MAJOR
                                (laughs)
                          I doubt much can change that.
                          The enemy has five brigades
                          waiting for us.

                                DUPONT
                          We need more time.

                                MAJOR
                          Won't get it.
                               (shrugs)
                          We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.

    Dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate.

                                MAJOR
                          Eat up Dupont.  It will probably
                          be your last.

                                DUPONT
                                (rises)
                          Not likely.

    Dupont goes to the window.  Dusk shines orange on his face.

    In the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up,
    Mulet, is chopping firewood.


91  EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            91

    Several hours later.
    Most are asleep.  Mulet continues his wood splitting.

    From out of the dark cottage steps Dupont.

                                DUPONT (CONOR)
                          I thought I gave orders the
                          regiment was to drill.

                                MULET
                          Staff sargeant detailed me to
                          prepare firewood for the break-
                          fast cooking.

                                DUPONT
                          What is your position?

                                MULET
                          Second musketeer.

                                DUPONT
                          I understand you joined up in
                          Bremen.

                                MULET
                          You seem to understand a great
                          deal.

                                DUPONT
                          I am a Major, Private.  You would
                          do well remembering that when
                          addressing me.

                                MULET
                          Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we
                          spoke as equals.

                                DUPONT
                          Equals?

                                MULET
                               (shrugs)
                          If you wish to play games, Major.

    Mulet returns to his chore.

                                DUPONT
                          Wait.  I think we understand each
                          other.

                                MULET
                          We have no understanding.

                                DUPONT
                          Then it is time two of us did.
                          You are very young.  I was once
                          young.  I can help.

    Mulet LAUGHS.

                                MULET
                          Help?  I've seen others "help".
                          Somehow a head always ended up
                          on the counter.

                                DUPONT
                          It can be different.  It must be.

                                MULET
                          It never changes, Major.

    Mulet turns to his chore.  Dupont grabs his arm.

                                DUPONT
                          We must talk.

                                MULET
                             (shakes him off)
                          Stay out of it.

                                DUPONT
                                (angry)
                          Don't threaten me, Private.

                                MULET
                                (disgust)
                          Who do you think I am?  One of your
                          freckle faced children waiting to
                          die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You
                          and I just living will always be a
                          threat.  Forever.  Look at your life,
                          Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there
                          but threat.  Threats and nothingness.
                          It's what we live for.

    Mulet turns his back on Dupont.
    Dupont draws his cutlass.

                                DUPONT
                          Do not turn your back on me.

                                MULET
                          You are really going to force this,
                          aren't you?

                                DUPONT
                          Either you are with me or against me.

    Mulet turns slowly, axe in hand.

                                MULET
                          Have I a choice?

    The two stare into eyes empty of emotion.

    Mulet's hand flinches.  An attack?

    Dupont CUTS quickly, slicing open both of Mulet's arms.
    The axe drops to the ground.

    Mulet seems strangely calm.

                                MULET
                          You see Major?  You are not so
                          different.

    Dupont cuts off Mulet's head where he stands.


92  EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT                                           92

    Dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into
    a swamp.


93  INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT                                          93

    It is very late.  Only a few OFFICERS are seated in the pews.
    Dupont tries to concentrate on prayer, but is distracted.

                                MULET
                             (voice flashback)
                          You see Major?  You are not so
                          different...

                                DUPONT
                          I had no choice.

    Dupont sighs and looks to the altar.

                                DUPONT
                          Who am I deceiving?

                                KNIGHT
                          Certainly not me.

    Dupont whirls around to see the Knight, dressed as he in uniform,
    sitting one row behind.

    Dupont leaps to his feet.

                                KNIGHT
                          You needn't look so flushed,
                          Major.  You are quite safe in
                          church.

    Dupont eases his breathing.

                                KNIGHT
                          State of grace and all that.

                                DUPONT
                          Tradition.

                                KNIGHT
                          It's all we have.

    Dupont has backed up a few paces.

                                KNIGHT
                          All this time and still a scared
                          little boy.

    Dupont sits down.

                                DUPONT
                          Not so scared.

                                KNIGHT
                          Perhaps not.
                               (smiles)
                          You seem to have misplaced a
                          private.  No doubt by now his
                          head is stranger to his neck.

                                DUPONT
                          No doubt.

                                KNIGHT
                          You surprise me.  Eliminating a
                          rival like that.  Such are the
                          actions of a man of conquest.  I
                          was mistaken.  300 years have
                          turned the boy's fear into ambit-
                          ion.

                                DUPONT
                          You're wrong.

                                KNIGHT
                          I know you very well, Conor MacLeod.
                          And I can see the truth beginning
                          to make itself clear to you.  Mulet,
                          Romirez, they were fools without
                          vision.  It was destined that the
                          board would be cleared for the real
                          players.

    The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont.

                                DUPONT
                          Romirez understood.  Not you.

                                KNIGHT
                          Romirez is dust.

    The Knight looks to the altar.

                                KNIGHT
                          Finish your prayers?

                                DUPONT
                          Finish yours?

                                KNIGHT
                                (smiles)

                          I am your only real friend, you
                          know.  The only one who truly
                          understands you.

                          I look forward to the day we
                          meet again.  And I kill you.

                                DUPONT
                          So sure?

    The Knight leans forward and puts his face very near.

                                KNIGHT
                          You can't stay in church forever.

    The Knight moves into the aisle.

                                KNIGHT
                          Good night, Major.

    He exits.

    Conor sits in the dim church alone.  Very alone.

94  EXT. WORSTICK CHURCH (PRESENT DAY)                              94

    Richard Taupin sits against the stone of an old Catholic church.
    Taupin sighs.  A long, weary sigh.


95  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         95

    Taupin and Brenna sit at a table working on forms.

    Taupin looks up from his work and studies Brenna's face without
    malice.


95  EXT. CREEK - DAY                                                95

    Brenna and Taupin are taking a walk along the township's
    outskirts.

    Crossing a small bridge over a smaller creek, they encounter
    the elderly caretaker Mr. North and his eight year old GRANDSON.
    Both with fishing poles.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Morning Mr. North

                                TAUPIN
                          Same.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Such a pretty day.  If I live
                          to be 90 I'll never tire of
                          mornings like this.  Mind you
                          I'm 74 now.

                                TAUPIN
                          No.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Yes sir.  When you get older your
                          priorities change.  It's the simple
                          things that count.  Without them
                          growing old can be a very lonely
                          thing.

                                TAUPIN
                          I'm sure that's true.

    The grandson is having difficulty baiting his line.  Taupin bends
    down beside the young fisherman.

                                TAUPIN
                              (takes worm)
                          Here.  The hook should go just below
                          the head, where the meat is toughest.

                                GRANDSON
                          Thanks.

    Taupin's show of affection surprises Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Show you a trick.

    Taupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them
    around the hook.

                                TAUPIN
                          Fish are creatures of habit.  They
                          like their food where they're used
                          to it.  At the top, hiding in old
                          leaves.

                                GRANDSON
                          Where did you learn that?

                                TAUPIN
                          My father taught me.

                                GRANDSON
                          Your father must be smart.

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes, he was.

    Brenna is touched.


96  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                 96

    Brenna lies on her bed thinking.  She puts on a robe and walks
    into the living room.

    LIVING ROOM

    Taupin sits before the fireplace, its flames reflecting on his
    brandy glass.  Brenna moves quietly to a seat beside him.

                                TAUPIN
                            (eyes on the fireplace)
                          There was a man once.  Just a simple
                          woodcarver.  But he understood.  More
                          than anyone he could see to the heart
                          of it.
                                (beat)
                          It never ends.  Today is the same as
                          the first.  Tomorrow will be the
                          same as today.  So much time.  And all
                          of it wasted.
                                (beat)
                          You love history?

                                BRENNA
                          Yes.

                                TAUPIN
                          I wish I could.


97  INT. CITY HALL                                                  97

    Brenna looks through a property zoning book.


98  EXT. WORSTICK MAIN STREET - DAY                                 98

    Walking past small town stores, Brenna allows herself a moment
    to window shop.

    IN A SHOP WINDOW

    Is a small poster advertising a community get-together.  Brenna
    peels it off the glass and slips it into her notebook.


99  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         99

    Brenna and Taupin go over various forms and documents.

                                BRENNA
                          The estate stuff is pretty straight
                          forward.  Just lots of forms and an
                          appearance at the county seat.

                                TAUPIN
                          It will take some time for the
                          forms to clear before you go to
                          Gettysburg.

    Brenna is silent.

                                TAUPIN
                          Second thoughts?

    Pause.

                                BRENNA
                          No.
                                (beat)
                          So what now?  We just wait?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          Well, as long as we're stuck here.

    She hands him the poster from earlier.

                                BRENNA
                          It's some sort of party the
                          town is throwing.

                                TAUPIN
                          They do it each year.

                                BRENNA
                          I thought it might be a nice break
                          from all of this.

    Taupin stacks the documents into a folder.

                                TAUPIN
                          Maybe it would do us both good.

                                BRENNA
                          There's a catch.  You're supposed
                          to wear 19th century clothing.


100  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         100

     Taupin is going through an old trunk.

                                TAUPIN
                          My father was something of a
                          junk collector.

     He comes across a long period dress and offers it to Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Here, try this.  I suppose they're
                          still making women the same as back
                          then.

                                BRENNA
                          It's beautiful.

                                TAUPIN
                          A little dusty.

     Taupin fishes through the trunk and comes up with an old top
     hat.  He turns it over in his hand with stoic memory.

101  EXT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - DUSK                               101

     Conor and a beautiful young woman, KATHERINE, sit on the porch
     steps in 1800s period dress.  Other young COUPLES relax nearby
     enjoying the warm summer's twilight.  Katherine's MOTHER shuffles
     between the couples offering lemonade, cakes, and the like.

                                KATHERINE
                          Do it again.

     She is thoroughly charmed by Conor.

                                CONOR
                          All right.

     Conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers.  By turning his
     hand over and bending his knuckles just so, the web becomes the
     outline of a lion..

                                CONOR
                          A lion.
                                (growls)

     Katherine is delighted.

     Conor starts to remove the yarn.  Katherine touches his arm.

                                KATHERINE
                          Oh please.  Another one.

                                CONOR
                          What would you like?

                                KATHERINE
                          Something pretty.

                                CONOR
                          Like you.

     Conor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a
     four leaf clover.

                                KATHERINE
                          That's wonderful.  Where did you
                          ever learn it?

                                CONOR
                          Far away.

                                KATHERINE
                          Kiss me.

     Conor shoots a glance for the mother, then kisses Katherine
     softly.

                                YOUNG MAN
                                (o.s.)
                          You'll be leaving the girl alone.

     A YOUNG MAN stands a few yards from the stairs.

                                KATHERINE
                          David.

                                CONOR
                          Do you have cause to bothering
                          us?

                                YOUNG MAN
                          That's my girl.

                                KATHERINE
                          David, we've already spoken of this.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          He's not what he pretends to be.

     Conor climbs to his feet.

                                CONOR
                          You best leave, son.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          You think you're so high and
                          mighty, coming into town and
                          taking a man's woman.  Well I
                          know about you.  I know about
                          the things you do.

                                CONOR
                             (moving closer)
                          I said you best leave.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          You'd like that, wouldn't you?
                              (to Katherine)
                          Ask him about his friends.  The
                          ones he meets in the town square.
                          Ask him about the blade he keeps
                          beneath his bed.

     Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close.

                                CONOR
                             (like ice)
                          Leave.  While you still can.

     The youth pushes away from the grasp.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          You don't frighten me.

                                CONOR
                          I should.

     The young man throws a fist at Conor.  It is easily blocked.
     Conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks
     the young man gasping onto the ground.

     Katherine runs up behind and grabs Conor's outstretched arm.

                                KATHERINE
                          No!  Leave him.  Please don't hurt him.
                          Please.

     COUGHING painfully, the youth climbs to his feet and staggers
     away.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          He's not what you think.

     He turns and runs down the road.

                                YOUNG MAN
                          He's not what you think!

     Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice.

                                KATHERINE
                          I don't care who you are or where
                          you come from.

     She hugs him tightly.

                                KATHERINE
                          I love you.

     Conor's face softens as he brings up an arm to hold her.

102  INT. WORSTICK TOWN HALL (PRESENT DAY)                         102

     An auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and
     strung paper into a small town party.

     TEENAGERS in period dress control the floor, dancing to a
     decidedly un-period ROCK BAND.

     The OLDER GUESTS are gathered around the punch bowl talking
     crops or Pennsylvania politics.

     BRENNA

     Fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress, enters
     with Taupin, himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape.

     His clothes fit perfectly.

     Mr. North, comically dressed as a pirate, greets them.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Mr. Taupin!  Glad you could make it.
                          Best get some punch before it's
                          gone.  Near the whole valley showed
                          up.

     They go to the table.

     Taupin pours a glass of punch.  An ELDERLY WOMAN approaches him.

                                WOMAN
                          If I didn't know better I'd say
                          William Taupin.

                                TAUPIN
                          His son.  Richard.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Mr. Taupin is up from Washington
                          to look over his father's estate.

                                WOMAN
                          Your father died some years ago.
                          This is your first visit?

     The tone is snide.

                                TAUPIN
                          Of sorts.

                                WOMAN
                          I suppose a Taupin had to show
                          up eventually.
                               (walks away)

                                TAUPIN
                          Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

     She turns in surprise at his knowing her name, then walks on.

                                BRENNA
                          What was all that about?

                                MR. NORTH
                          Sorry Mr. Taupin.  That's not meant
                          for you.  Just some didn't take
                          much to your father.

                                BRENNA
                          Why?

                                TAUPIN
                          My father was never one for social
                          whirls.

                                MR. TAUPIN
                          Kept to himself for sure.  Then with
                          all that business in '31.

                                BRENNA
                          What business?

                                MR. NORTH
                          Family down the road from the
                          Taupin place was murdered.  All
                          cut up they were.  Horrible.  Two
                          strangers were also found with
                          the bodies.  No one ever accused
                          William, but with his reputation
                          as a loner and the rumors about
                          him and some of the wives in town,
                          folks just never forgot.  Most
                          were relieved when they heard he'd
                          died.  Sorry Mr. Taupin.

                                TAUPIN
                          Nothing to be sorry about.

                                MR. NORTH
                          Just your pappy scared some.

     The rock band finished as a PORTLY MAN in a union soldier's
     uniform takes the microphone.

                                PORTLY
                          All right, the kids have had their
                          fun.  Now it's time for a little
                          more traditional dancing.

     The rock band gives ground to a group of older MUSICIANS.  With
     a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles
     and hammer dulcimer.

     The costumed guests take to the floor.

                                BRENNA
                          I don't know any of these.  I'll
                          make a fool of myself.

                                TAUPIN
                          Follow me.

     Taupin starts into it with perfect grace.  A faltering Brenna
     tries to keep up.

                                BRENNA
                          William Taupin seems to have left
                          his mark.

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          And you are William
                          Taupin, aren't you?

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

     They do a final turn and finish.  The other DANCERS applaud.

                                BRENNA
                          You're using your son's
                          name.

                                TAUPIN
                          No.  Just the child of
                          some lonely girl I gave
                          a ride to.  When they
                          died I put them in a
                          grave with my name on it.
                          Twenty years later I
                          became the son.

     Brenna is staring at him.

                                TAUPIN
                          More punch?

     He leads her to a table.

                                BRENNA
                          Then you must be at least
                          70 years old.

                                TAUPIN
                          At least.

                                BRENNA
                          That's impossible.

     Several of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across
     the room.


103  EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT                                      103

     A bus with "Gettysburg" across the front pulls to a stop at
     a dark terminal.  A lone passenger steps off into the mist.
     It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying
     only a long, narrow case.


104  EXT. - NIGHT                                                  104

     Brenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall.

                                BRENNA
                          It's frightening sometimes the
                          way you talk about other people's
                          lives.

                                TAUPIN
                          A factor of age.

                                BRENNA
                          I hope I never get that old.

                                TAUPIN
                          You won't.

     Brenna pulls away.

                                BRENNA
                          I must be insane.  Leaving work,
                          ditching cops.  All to follow a
                          murderer.  A very old murderer,
                          but a murderer just the same.

                                TAUPIN
                          Why are you here?

                                BRENNA
                          I've been telling myself it's the
                          award winning journal article I'm
                          going to write.  But it's not.
                              (looks at him squarely)
                          It's you.

                                TAUPIN
                          I see.

                                BRENNA
                          I'm not even sure why.

                                TAUPIN
                          Hardly a reason to run off with
                          a murderer.

                                BRENNA
                          My life has been chock full of
                          people with complications and weak-
                          nesses.  I can't stand it.  But
                          you're different.  It's in your
                          hands.  A clarity.

                                TAUPIN
                          You are a very perceptive young
                          woman.

                                BRENNA
                          Just a little crazy.

     A thoughtful pause.

                                TAUPIN
                          Miss Cartwright, it's time I
                          showed you something.


105  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         105

     Taupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall.

     Taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something.  A press
     from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway.

                                TAUPIN
                              (gestures to interior)
                          Miss Cartwright?

     Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness.  Taupin follows and
     switches on the light.


106  INT. HIDDEN ROOM                                              106

     Brenna's expression changes to awe.

     The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic.
     Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian
     fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras
     crowd the shelving and floor space.

     The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had
     taken the time to keep a scrapbook.

                                BRENNA
                          My God.

     The sight is overwhelming.

                                TAUPIN
                          I had this room built some
                          time ago.

     Brenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along
     its intricate weaving.

                                BRENNA
                          Who are you?

                                TAUPIN
                          That would be difficult to explain.

                                BRENNA
                          I'd like you to try.

     Taupin picks up a Byzantine icon, brushing the dust from its
     shoulders.

                                TAUPIN
                          I was born Conor MacLeod in the
                          village of Ardvrek on the High-
                          land plain of Strathnaver in the
                          clan of MacLeod under the King
                          of Scotland.  On the eleventh of
                          December, 1408.

     He replaces the icon.

                                TAUPIN
                          I have served in the armies of
                          twelve nations, married nine
                          women, fathered thirty-eight
                          children and buried them all.

     Taupin walks along the cases.

                                TAUPIN
                          I carried that rifle in World
                          War I.  This book is a 16th Century
                          policy report for the King of
                          Austria.  The diploma is my con-
                          ference of degree in Latin from
                          Trinity College.  Class of 1672.
                                 (beat)
                          It goes on.

                                BRENNA
                          That's why Smith called you
                          MacLeod.

                                TAUPIN
                          Yes.

                                BRENNA
                          He knows about you.

                                TAUPIN
                          He is older than I.

                                BRENNA
                          What could possibly be worth all
                          this murder and distruction.

                                TAUPIN
                          Sometimes I think it's just for
                          something to do.  A conquest to
                          be the last.  Something to hold
                          onto while everything else around
                          you withers and blows away.  Some-
                          thing to replace the love that can
                          never work.

                                BRENNA
                          That's insane.

                                TAUPIN
                          Perhaps.  There is something more.
                          An inheritance.

                                BRENNA
                          Of bodies.

                                TAUPIN
                          I didn't kill the watchman.

                                BRENNA
                          You killed those other two.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not the same.

                                BRENNA
                          What about that family in '31?

                                TAUPIN
                          Sometimes innocents become involved.

                                BRENNA
                          You and your buddy make a real
                          team, don't you?  Exchanging
                          eloquent threats in iambic pen-
                          tameter while hacking up all
                          the innocents in between.

                                TAUPIN
                          There are differences.

                                BRENNA
                          You kill with your left hand?

                                TAUPIN
                          I haven't killed _you_.

                                BRENNA
                          Is that a threat?

     Taupin moves very close.

                                TAUPIN
                          No.

     Brenna's face softens.  She turns away.

                                BRENNA
                          Don't.

                                TAUPIN
                          Come here, Brenna.

                                BRENNA
                          Damn you.

     He kisses her.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


107  EXT. TURN OF THE CENTURY CEMETARY - DAY                       107

     RELATIVES in period dress watch as a family member is lowered
     into the ground.

     A very OLD WOMAN stands stoically, supported on both sides by
     her middle aged SONS.

                                MINISTER
                          May God commend into his kingdom
                          the soul of our dear departed
                          Jason, son of Katherine-

     The old woman.

                                MINISTER
                          And brother to Howard and James-

     The two middle aged sons.

     CONOR

     Watches the funeral quietly at a distance.

     THE OLD WOMAN

     As the minister continues allows her gaze to wander.  She sees
     Conor standing at the treeline.  Her eyes crinkle in disbelief.

     Releasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor.
     Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony.

     CONOR

     Watches the woman approach but decides against moving.
     She stops a few paces away and looks over him.

                                OLD WOMAN
                          You.

                                CONOR
                          Katherine.

                                OLD WOMAN
                          What are you doing here?

                                CONOR
                          I owe him this.

                                OLD WOMAN
                          He never knew you.

     The two sons come up behind.  The three stand there: an old
     woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons
     old enough to be his father.

                                SON #1
                          Is something wrong, Mother?

                                OLD WOMAN
                          Howard.  James.  This is your
                          father...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


108  INT. BEDROOM                                                  108

     Taupin and Brenna lie together.

     Running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the
     countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds.

     Taupin strokes her softly.

                                TAUPIN
                          "Brenna".  In Celtic is means
                          "woman with raven hair".  Only
                          chieftan's daughters were allowed
                          it.

     Brenna is lost in Taupin's scars.

                                BRENNA
                          What is it like?  Being you?

                                TAUPIN
                          Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that
                          would kill you and fear of those that
                          would love you.  It can never last, and
                          in the end you always end up destroying
                          both.

                                BRENNA
                          But you're known so much.
                          History I'll only read about.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's all the same.  Half lives that
                          never go away.

                                BRENNA
                          What is it you want?

                                TAUPIN
                          All of it finished.


109  EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING                                      109

     Taupin and Brenna stand beside her car.  She has an armload
     of documents.

                                TAUPIN
                          Gettysburg's an hour's drive
                          at most.  You should be back
                          by nightfall.

                                BRENNA
                          Will I see you again?

                                TAUPIN
                          Be careful.  Don't stay any
                          longer than you have to.

     Pause.  Brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly
     into the car.

                                TAUPIN
                          Good luck.

110  EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY                      110

     Detective Moran and his Inspector walk among parked squad cars.

                                MORAN
                          Are you sure?

                                INSPECTOR
                          Won't know till the
                          records department comes
                          back with it this after-
                          noon.  Looks good though.
                          They found the receipt
                          in his townhouse.  It was
                          pretty smeared but had
                          Taupin's father listed
                          as a signatory.

                                MORAN
                          Round up who you can
                          and put them on standby.

                                INSPECTOR
                          Think we should call the
                          local P.D. out there
                          first?

                                MORAN
                          No.  I want this to be
                          all ours.


111  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                    111

     Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack.

                                CLERK
                          O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that's
                          all I need.

     The clerk fills out a small sheet and hands it to her.

                                CLERK
                          Just take this down
                          the hall to the regis-
                          trar.  Hurry up though,
                          it's near closing time.
                          Most everyone's gone
                          home already.

     A pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor.


112  INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE                                       112

     Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two CLERKS
     sit in an office mostly cleared of employees.

     Brenna hands the slip to a clerk.

                                CLERK #2
                          I'll be right back.

     She disappears into the rear area.

                                BRENNA
                             (to other clerk)
                          Do you have a drinking
                          fountain?

                                CLERK #3
                          Around the corner.

     Brenna steps around and takes a drink.  She looks into her
     reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling
     with her hair.

     THE CLERK

     Still hasn't returned.  Brenna drums her fingers on the
     counter top and looks around the office.

     The second clerk is also gone.

     Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk.
     She steps over to it.

     It is a large blood stain.

     Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors.
     They're closed.

     Brenna rushes to the doors.  Someone's locked them.
     She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight
     walking to her with his stained sword.

     With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and
     runs down an opposite corridor.

     THE KNIGHT

     Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM
     of his palm.

     BRENNA

     Has run out of corridor.  She looks back at the Knight closing
     the distance.  CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for
     a way out.

     The Knight is nearly upon her.

     In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing
     its heavy door.

     THE CLOSET

     Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops.  Her BREATHING
     is at a PANIC.

     THE KNIGHT

     Tries the door handle.
     Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into
     the wood.

                                BRENNA
                                (crying)
                          Oh God...

     He STRIKES again.  And again.  Splinters smack against surround-
     ing walls.

                                BRENNA
                          Go away!  Oh God, go
                          away!

     CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far
     wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch.

     THE KNIGHT

     Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing.
     Brenna SCREAMS.
     The door collapses.


113  EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING                                        113

     A group of unmarked police cars race by with the last light
     of day.


114  INT. CAR                                                      114

     At the wheel is Moran's assistant, the inspector.


114  INT. HOME - NIGHT                                             114

     Taupin stands at his fireplace, the only light in the room,
     poking at it with a tong.

     His gaze goes to a mantle clock.
     It is 10:30 PM.

     The phone RINGS.
     He looks to it.
     It RINGS again.
     He picks up the receiver slowly and places it against his ear.

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          We have some unfinished
                          business.

                                TAUPIN
                          Are you here?

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          I want you to come to
                          me.

                                TAUPIN
                          And if I refuse?

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          Give me an address where
                          I can forward Miss Cart-
                          wright's head.

     This affects him.

                                KNIGHT'S VOICE
                          Yes laddie, I have her.

                                TAUPIN
                          Should I care?

                                KNIGHT
                          You have three hours.


115  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT                                       115

     The unmarked cars shoot by.


116  INT. HOME                                                     116

     Taupin hangs up the phone.
     He looks to the sword on the table, reflecting the firelight.


117  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                        117

     POLICE OFFICERS, placed around Taupin's house, are COCKING
     shotguns and CHAMBERING pistols.

     Two officers take positions on either side of the door.  A
     third, after getting the signal, kicks the door open.


118  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                118

     The officers drop to firing positions in the doorway.  The
     room is empty.


119  INT. FARMHOUSE BEDROOM                                        119

     An officer BURSTS in.  It's empty.


120  INT. MAIN ROOM                                                120

     The Inspector is on the phone.

                                INSPECTOR
                          He's not here.


121  EXT. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                           121

     Spotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding
     blackness.

     Taupin's face moves into frame.


122  EXT. MONUMENT STAIRS - NIGHT                                  122

     Sword firmly in one hand, Taupin climb's the monument's steps.


123  INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                               123

     A twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his
     quotations.

     A sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands
     at the statue's base.

                                KNIGHT
                          Welcome.

     Taupin stands at the entrance.

                                KNIGHT
                          Kahn sends his best.

     In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of
     death still pressed into the face.  Taupin's eyes return slowly
     to the Knight and Brenna.

                                TAUPIN
                          Let her go.

    The Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall.

                                KNIGHT
                          You disappoint me.
                             (looks at Brenna)
                          I thought you'd finally gotten over
                          that sort of thing.

                                TAUPIN
                          Leave her out of this.

                                KNIGHT
                          As you wish.

    The Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle.  Taupin
    does the same.  The weapons are CLANKED together twice, then
    pulled back into battle position.

    The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an
    opening.

    The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high
    walls.

    Another ATTACK without result.

                                KNIGHT
                          You can do better than that.

    Taupin swings.  The Knight jumps back.  Sweat gleams from their
    brows.


124 EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                124

    Two LOVERS enjoy a late night walk along the tidal basin.
    There is a distant CLANKING of metal.

                                BOY
                          It's from over near the memorial.

    He jumps up on a rock.  Several yards away can be seen two figures
    attacking each other.

                                BOY
                          Shit.


125 INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT                                 125

    Standing at a map of the city, Moran nurses a cup of coffee.

    The phone RINGS.

                                MORAN
                          Moran.  All right, get a patrol
                          unit out there right away.  I'll
                          meet them.


126 INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                126

    The Knight and Taupin are PANTING heavily.

    The Knight goes low.  Taupin blocks.  The Knight comes overhead
    quickly.  Taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his
    shoulder and chest.  The impact knocks him flat on his back.

    The Knight looks down on his wounded prey.

    A SCREECH of brakes from outside the monument.  Two OFFICERS
    are coming up the steps.

                                KNIGHT
                          No.  Not now.


127 EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          127

    The officers reach the top and enter.

    INSIDE

    One of the officers is Dennis, who sees only a CRYING Brenna
    and Taupin lying wounded on the floor.

                                DENNIS
                          Brenna?

    The Knight rushes up from behind, his sword in full swing.


128 EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT                                      128

    Moran's car blows through a cross street.


129 INT. CAR                                                       129

    Moran is at the wheel.


130 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          130

    The Knight walks from the two officers spread out like rag
    dolls on the floor.

                                KNIGHT
                              (to Taupin)
                          Get up.

    Taupin looks at Brenna and the dead policemen.  A resignation
    sweeps over him.

                                TAUPIN
                          What's the point?

                                KNIGHT
                          This isn't done.  Get up.

                                TAUPIN
                          What's the point!  You have me,
                          finish it!

                                KNIGHT
                          I have waited forever for this.
                          You will not cheapen it, little
                          boy.

                                TAUPIN
                                (irony)
                          Tradition.

                                KNIGHT
                          It's all we have.

                                TAUPIN
                          Go to hell.

    The Knight looks to Brenna.

                                KNIGHT
                          Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like
                          to play.

                                TAUPIN
                          Leave her alone.

                                KNIGHT
                          Get up.

    Taupin struggles to his feet.  Blood pouring from his shirt, he
    stands uneasily with his sword at ready.

    The Knight swings.  Taupin blocks.


131 EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          131

    Moran drives up.  There is an empty police car, the door still
    ajar.


132 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          132

    Taupin is badly outclassed.

    He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly
    with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws
    him again to the floor.

                                BRENNA
                          You bastard!

                                KNIGHT
                          Be silent.

                                BRENNA
                          Leave him alone.

                                KNIGHT
                          You will be silent!!

    The voice is THUNDERING.

    Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor.  His
    teeth grind in pain.

    The Knight smiles.

                                KNIGHT
                          I do hope you're enjoying this
                          as much as me.

    MORAN

    Stands in the entryway.  The Knight sees him.

                                KNIGHT
                          Get out.

    Moran draws his pistol.
    The Knight walks toward him,

                                KNIGHT
                          This is nothing that concerns you.

    Moran levels his gun.
    The Knight raises his sword.

                                KNIGHT
                          You will leave!

    Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES.  The slugs slam into the Knight,
    blowing him off his feet.

    He lies still.

    Moran looks to Brenna.  To Taupin.  Then he walks closer to the
    Knight.

                                TAUPIN
                               (hoarse)
                          Don't.

    Taupin curls in a spasm of pain.
    Moran moves closer.

    The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over
    his heart.  He isn't breathing.

    Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face.

                                TAUPIN
                          Stop.  You don't understand.

    The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's
    chest.  The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall.

    Taupin crawls for the Knight.

    Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes.  The Knight, blood
    pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts
    quickly.

    Moran slides off the sword dead.

    Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest.  The Knight GAGS
    in surprise and crumples.  Taupin CUTS again, then puts the
    blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat.

                                TAUPIN
                          In mamus tuas Domine commendo
                          spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum
                          in nomine Domine.

    He raises the sword.

                                TAUPIN
                          Requiescant in pace.

    And CUTS the Knight's head off.

    Taupin drops his sword.
    His breathing quickens.
    A sensation sweeps over him.

    Taupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING.  He sucks in painful gulps
    of air.

                                BRENNA
                          My God.

    Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.

                                BRENNA
                          Conor.

    Taupin is looking past her.

    A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder.  She
    SCREAMS.  The headless body of the Knight stands beside her.

    THE KNIGHT'S HEAD

    Lies on the floor.
    The eyes open.  The face pulls into a smile.

                                KNIGHT
                          And now you know.

    The eyes roll up into the skull.  The face slackens.

    The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses
    to the ground.

    TAUPIN

    Is CRYING.  Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something
    else.

                                BRENNA
                          What's wrong?

                                TAUPIN
                          I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't
                          stand it!

    Brenna kneels beside him.

                                TAUPIN
                          The scream of your blood.  The
                          shriek of trees.  Stop it!  Stop it!

    Brenna SOBS.

                                BRENNA
                          What is it?

                                TAUPIN
                          I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the
                          _last one_!

    Taupin doubles over in pain.  The pain of the whole world trying
    to force itself into him.

    Brenna tries to hold him.  He pushes her savagely away.

                                TAUPIN
                          Get out.

                                BRENNA
                          No!

                                TAUPIN
                          I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed
                          everything I've ever touched!  Oh
                          God...

    He doubles over in pain.

                                BRENNA
                          Conor...

    He grabs his sword and threatens her.

                                TAUPIN
                          _Get out_!

    SOBBING, Brenna runs from the memorial.  Taupin is alone.
    Bleeding.  Crying.  In agony.

    FADE OUT

    FADE UP:


133 INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM                                        133

    Brenna at work in the research area.  She's silent.  Distant.
    Something is missing from her.


134 EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY                                   134

    Brenna stands in the street before Taupin's townhouse.
    A boarded up window.  A for-sale sign.  Taupin is gone forever.
    As if he never was.


135 INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT                                        135

    A desk.  A single light.  A cup of coffee.

    A typewriter.

    Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface.  CLACK-CLACK.
    It is at last her journal article.  She types a line, then rips
    it from the carriage and tears it to pieces.

    The thoughts won't come.


136 EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     136

    Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group
    of wild park cats.

    A shadow covers her face.  She looks up.

    It is Taupin.

    Something has changed him.  His face is less cynical.  More
    vulnerable.  More human.

    He sits down on the grass beside her.

                                BRENNA
                             (after a moment)
                          What are we supposed to say?

    The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin.  They cautiously shrink
    away, frightened.

                                TAUPIN
                          The emptyness.  The years and years
                          of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only
                          by the quest for ultimate nothingness.
                          Who would have guessed?

                                BRENNA
                          The inheritance.

                                TAUPIN
                          Not power.  Not control.

    Taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him.

                                TAUPIN
                          Life.  It is the gift and the under-
                          standing of life.

                                BRENNA
                          You have lived forever.

                                TAUPIN
                          Life is only life when it is bounded
                          by death.  The inheritance is death.
                          The gift is the finality of life.
                          To be part of the fabric.  The inside.
                              (turns to Brenna)
                          I love you Brenna.

    Brenna's chin quivers.

                                TAUPIN
                          It will be horrible.  The future.  I
                          may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows.
                          I can promise you nothing.  Nothing
                          but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment
                          of love, is that not worth a lifetime?

                                BRENNA
                               (crying)
                          Yes.

    He holds her.  They hold each other.

                                TAUPIN
                          It's taken me so long.  So very
                          long.

    A jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own.

 HIGHLANDER IV WORLD WITHOUT END OVER BLACK, A VOICE: VOICE IN THE DAYS BEFORE MEMORY, THERE WERE THE IMMORTALS. WE WERE WITH YOU THEN, AND WE ARE WITH YOU NOW. SWEEP LOW through CLINGING HIGHLAND MISTS that shroud a land still in its infancy. Cathedral spires of granite. Cradled lakes. A solitary vastness. VOICE (cont'd) WE HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPED AS GODS MISTAKEN FOR DEMONS AND REVILED'AS WITCHES. WE ARE THE SEEDS OF A MILLION LEGENDS BUT OUR TRUE ORIGINS ARE UNKNOWN. WE SIMPLY ARE. ANCIENT CASTLES dot the landscape, whisper of battles long forgotton. VOICE (cont'd) WE ARE DRIVEN BY THE CEASELESS FIGHT TO ENDURE. NO LIMIT, IT IS A BATTLE THAT KNOWS NO BOUNDRY OF TIME OR PLACE. TWO FIGURES clash with broadswords atop the tallest promontory. VOICE (cont'd) TO THE WINNER COMES AN UNKNOWABLE PRIZE. YET AN IMMORTAL CAN FIND NO COMFORT IN VICTORY. MATCH MOVE to the top of an ULTRA-MODERN SKYSCRAPER. Swordsmen continue to battle. VOICE (cont'd) BECAUSE IN THE END, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. Loser falls to the other's sword as the HEAVENS CLEAVE in a TITANIC RUPTURE OF SIGHT AND SOUND. Like the birth of a brand new universe. BEGIN/END TITLES: EXT - MANHATTAN, PRESENT-DAY ESTABLISHING - DAWN Teeming millions. Yawning concrete spires. Blare of traffic. EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - DAWN Engraved into a brass plaque: MACLEOD & ELLENSTEIN ANTIQUES (FORMERLY RUSSELL NASH LTD) A FACE reflects in the window glass. It's RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60's now, a graying, maternal beauty. She moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t. It falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to "WERE CLOSED" Rachel hesitates. Draws a shallow breath and steps inside. INT - ANTIQUE STORE All those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace. Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding statuary. She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp. Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty. Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword. RACHEL (icy dread) Connor...? She crosses to the foot of the staircase. Listens. A MUSIC BOX spools a faint, tinny madrigal. She climbs the stairs, padding softly upward. The music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE. AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING Rachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat. BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel. PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor-- --except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut. INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES. A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD. YOUNG RACHEL Let me see, Connor! Let me see! Rachel stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in RAGGED FILM CLIPS. CONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse. CONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college graduation. CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper. In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not. Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet. THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves) THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF... and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken. She hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light. MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM... THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her. It's taunting her. Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone. Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant. Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook. RACHEL Hello? EXTREME CLOSE ON PHONE: A TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is the last thing Rachel hears before-- EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - WIDE --a BLISTERING EXPLOSION blows out the entire second floor. Rachel Ellenstein is obliterated right along with her own treasured history. Linger on the FLAMES as we TRANSITION TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS (1565) - DAY A MOUND OF BURNING CORPSES They crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them. It takes a moment to realize they're LIVESTOCK-- oxen, pigs, goats, sheep-- piled like burning refuse. A CRUDE, WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame. BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror. HEATHER My God, what are they? CONNOR Farm animals. Dead of the plague. HEATHER Why do they torment us with their dead cattle? (no response) Connor...? CONNOR They think I've brought this upon them. It's a warning. A deeper fear now grips Heather. HEATHER A warning?! They drove you from your home! They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?! Connor turns away from the flaming heap. CONNOR Someone to blame. CUT TO: CONNOR swinging astride his horse. HEATHER (dread) Don't go back there. THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance. CONNOR I have no choice. HEATHER Please-- CONNOR They can't hurt me. And they know it. But they can still hurt the ones I care about. Heather looks off. Shivers. HEATHER I'm afraid. Connor leans forward, takes her face in his hands. CONNOR I love you, Heather. More than anything in this world. She grips his hands. Desperately. CONNOR (cont'd) Do you believe me? HEATHER Yes. CONNOR Then you needn't be afraid. (kisses her) Nothing can ever keep us apart. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, VARIOUS - DAWN Connor travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog-shrouded valleys. CONNOR'S VOICE Nothing... CUT TO: EXT - RIDGE ABOVE GLENFINNAN - TWILIGHT He gazes down at the tiny hamlet of Glenfinnan, nestled between castle and shimmering loch. Breathes deep the forgotten smell of home. INT - HUT - EVENING CAIOLIN MACLEOD, ravaged by neglect and despair, strokes her son's face as if confirming his reality. CAIOLIN I thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch. CONNOR (smiles) Maybe I am, Mother. CAIOLIN (touches his hair) Then come, let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go. Connor lifts her from the tattered bed, spins her around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair. CONNOR Not before we put some meat on those bones. He rummages through her shelves looking for food. Finds painfully little. CONNOR (cont'd) No one comes to look after you? CAIOLIN They're all afraid of me. They think I bedevil their children because I've lost my own. CONNOR I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... CAIOLIN Tiny minds and sour dispositions. I don't need them, Connor. Any of them. Connor crouches at her feet. CONNOR Then it's settled. You're coming with me. There's somebody I want you to meet. She's nearly as beautiful as you. Caiolin blinks back her disbelief. CAIOLIN You're sure? CONNOR (cont'd) We leave tonight. Let's start packing. CAIOLIN (lifts up her shoes) I'm already packed. THE SLATTED WOODEN DOOR swings OPEN. A YOUNG MAN stands in the doorway. He's strong and severe, dressed in clergyman's black. But that's not what draws the eye. Even though it's cold enough to fog his breath-- he's sweatinq. Connor looks up, guarded. CONNOR Jacob-- KASE You shouldna come back, Connor. Connor feels the tension in Kase's voice. CONNOR Surely as a friend you can look the other way just this once... For old times' sake... KASE You knew. You knew what would happen if you came back. I am not to blame for this. CONNOR What? (beat) What have you done? KASE God help you. FATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY, the local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane. He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance. VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them. FATHER RAINEY In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic. (turns to the villagers) Take him. The townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other. FATHER RAINEY (cont'd) (squints) Heresy is not contagious. Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows. Once its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others SWARM HIM. EXT - STONE HUT - NIGHT Caiolin SCREAMS as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs. CUT TO: INT - STONE CELL - NIGHT Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp. VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant. He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway. Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned. TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight. Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter. JACOB KASE'S VOICE The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son. Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal: CONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition. CONNOR No.. . NO! ! JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of execution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina. KASE Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod? Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific. CAIOLIN If your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another. Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd. Kase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure. KASE (holding up Caiolin's crucifix) You won't need this where you're going. CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest. EXECUTIONER (softly) Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering. Caiolin nods. He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY. THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS. CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING... THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack. The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS. THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame... . . . and smiles weakly. CAIOLIN My water horse... AS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire. Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs. Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward. Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile. Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings. He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens. Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd. PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own. Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand. The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... . . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings. Kase crouches blustering over Rainey. KASE Father... Father, please-- (tries to staunch the bleeding) Father--! Rainey's eyes open slightly. RAINEY Who are you...? KASE Your son. It's your son-- Jacob. Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death. RAINEY (eyes widen) Who are YOU? KASE I'm your-- He stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead. CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the sight of his mother's blackened corpse. >KASE scoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman. >Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see. Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest. Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE. In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO. Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT Standing outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb. Nothing in the panorama would suggest we've just jumped four centuries into an uncertain future... Until-- A PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS chew their way up the rubbled slope. Fishtail to a stop. THE LEADER, a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded monk. JAMAICAN You people are extremely hard to find. Monk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN. HOODED MONK We like it that way. (pumps shotgun) Now go. The other six INTRUDERS surround the monk. His eyes flick from one to the next-- a buffet of different nationalities, all big. JAMAICAN Take your pick. Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead. Easy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet. And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others. IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE-- The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the bodies. MONK #1 Take the heads. Just in case. Saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun trained on the corpses. VOICE Don't bother. Really. A FIGURE stands in shadow, his face UNSEEN. We catch only a brief glimpse of a PRIESTS COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall. Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway. STRANGER Dont be long. INT - MONASTERY - NIGHT FOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs. He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years. Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently. Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses. STRANGER So it's true. He moves slowly among them. STRANGER (cont'd) What sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat. He pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted iron, the face by tangled beard. STRANGER (cont'd) Tell me-- is this the better way? I'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it. One by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored. Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall. STRANGER Which one is Connor MacLeod? CUSTODIAN I-- I don't know... They never told me names... STRANGER (low, seething) Don't. Lie. To. Me. CUSTODIAN I swear. I don't know... Stranger grabs him under the chin, lifts him to his toes. STRANGER You need to understand one thing, my gimpy friend. I don't care about the Game. I don't care about the rules. I don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize. The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending. STRANGER (cont'd) (squeezes his throat) I want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I'll leave. And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters. The custodian lifts a shaking finger. RACK FOCUS TO: THE PRISONER IN THE LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod. Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns... STRANGER Long time. Connor strains to lift his head. His voice comes weak and drug-heavy. CONNOR Who are you...? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. GLINT OF A SWUNG BLADE-- CUT TO: EXT - MONASTERY - NIGHT An unearthly LIGHT pulses through slitted windows and cracked mortar. TENDRILS of RAW ENERGY vein the ancient building, growing BRIGHTER until-- THE WINDOWS EXPLODE OUTWARD with a keening, animal-like HOWL. ABOVE the sky responds with SCREAMING WIND and TORRENTS of RAIN. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS - NIGHT WIND HOWLS over the City of Lights, slicing up the Seine to. . . DUNCAN MACLEOD'S BARGE docked at the quay. EXT - BARGE - NIGHT PUSH IN on DUNCAN MACLEOD, cross-legged in meditation atop the deck. He JOLTS from a series of SUDDEN VIOLENT IMAGES. A FACE, bolted immobile, wrenched in agony. A SWORDBLADE slashing into flesh. FINGERNAILS clawing wood. BLOOD flecking tile. ESSENCE. PHONE. Ringing. Duncan snaps up the receiver, sweat drenched. DUNCAN Yeah? Tiny electric CLICK... . . . then the HISS of an overseas line. WOMAN'S VOICE (filtered) He's dead. DUNCAN Who? CUT TO: A PAYPHONE, SOMEWHERE IN LOWER MANHATTAN In a driving RAIN. A woman's hand holds the receiver to her face, obscuring her features. WOMAN Connor MacLeod. He was killed last night. INT - DUNCAN'S BARGE Duncan reels with a sudden flood of emotions. DUNCAN Who is this?! WOMAN'S VOICE A friend. EXT - PAYPHONE The unidentified woman slowly lowers the receiver and sets it back in the cradle. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS, ESTABLISHING, SUNRISE Shadows crawl across the Parisian skyline as an ENGINE REVS TO 8000 RPM. STREET LEVEL POV: We PUNCH through the ARC DE TRIOMPHE and up the CHAMPS ELYSEE with a throaty FERARRI HOWL. On a WICKED DOWNSHIFT, we SQUEAL HARD RIGHT onto the PONT NEUF, stopping on a franc at EXT - NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY Duncan hops out of his Ferrari 355 Spyder, pauses before the massive Gothic edifice, then disappears inside. CLOSE ON A CROUCHING STONE GARGOYLE perched atop the highest balustrade. MOVE SIDEWAYS TO REVEAL A SECOND CROUCHING FIGURE, this one human. To many he'll be instantly familiar. Hes METHOS, oldest of all Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation. Methos keeps staring at the ground below, sipping bordeaux from a paper cup, even as Duncan joins him at the edge. DUNCAN Methos. METHOS so-- What brings you up here to the aerie of the lesser gods? DUNCAN I need your help. METHOS I'm out of the help business. No future in it. DUNCAN I was told Connor MacLeod was killed last night. Methos' darkens. Another one lost. DUNCAN (cont'd) I just want to know who did it. METHOS (sighs) In our world, does it really matter? DUNCAN It does to me. Methos looks down at the clotted life below. METHOS Did I ever tell you I once kept a vineyard on the very spot where they built this monstrosity? Glorious, the wine. (looks up) When did you see him last? DUNCAN Almost ten years ago. METHOS What did you talk about? DUNCAN Nothing much. METHOS Think back. FLASH TO: INT - PUB (FROM HIGHLANDER 1) - DAY Connor and Duncan hunch over the bar, pounding scotch. DUNCAN We mostly just sat around, downing shots, staring at the beer lights above the bar. When he finally got up to go, he looked at me like it was the last time I'd ever see him again. No goodbye. No handshake. Just got up and left. BACK TO SCENE: Duncan blinks back the memory. DUNCAN (cont'd) Nobody's seen him since. METHOS Describe the look. DUNCAN What do you mean? METHOS Describe it. DUNCAN It was like... FLASH: CONNOR'S FACE DUNCAN (cont'd) . . . Like every death he'd ever caused had come back to haunt him. BACK TO SCENE: Methos takes a thoughtful sip from his wine. METHOS For an Immortal who comes to abhor bloodshed, there's a solution-- a way to be removed from the Game forever. The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within yourself. It's called The Sanctuary. DUNCAN I don't understand. METHOS Think of those Buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their creed. They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody. A sanctuary of sorts. (beat) What I'm talking about is something similar. But one that doesn't allow for a change of heart. He opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below. Wine SPLATTERS like blood on white marble. METHOS (cont'd) Apparently it was wiped out last night. DUNCAN By who? METHOS I don't know. EXT - ABOVE THE ATLANTIC - DAY A 747 cruises at 40,000 feet. METHOS (O.S.) He left no witnesses. INT - 747 - DAY Duncan stares out the passenger window as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT sets a DRINK down. He lifts the little plastic COCKTAIL SWORD from the glass. Yanks it out of the olive... TRANSITION TO: A BROADSWORD being jerked from a fallen warrior. EXT - 17TH CENTURY BATTLEFIELD - DAWN FOLLOW THE SWORD swinging above a PAIR OF HIDE-BOOTED FEET that tramp across uneven ground littered with CORPSES. FEET STOP at a BLOOD-CAKED BODY, swathed in the shredded colors of a defeated army. On a SWIFT KICK TO THE RIBCAGE-- DUNCAN MACLEOD JERKS UPRIGHT, flailing in spastic fits. DUNCAN GAHHHHHHH! ! He blinks thickly, as if routed from a deep, disorienting slumber. Gapes up at-- A SILHOUETTE that ECLIPSES the rising sun. SILHOUETTE You've better things to do than lie there collecting flies. Duncan puts a hand to his chest, touches the worst of his several lethal wounds. Utter confusion stitches his face. SILHOUETTE (cont'd) I suppose you're wondering how a knock- kneed swordsman with your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day. The figure extends a hand to Duncan. Duncan hesitantly reaches up... DUNCAN (squints) Are you an angel? SILHOUETTE I've been called that. And worse. Duncans hand RECOILS-- SILHOUETTE (cont'd) Rest assured, I'm neither. He hoists Duncan to his feet. Duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles back with the gift of untold secrets. CONNOR I'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. And like you, I have a hard time dying. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - 747 - DAY Duncan's now sitting upright in his seat as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE brings him back to the here and now. FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) We'll be making our final descent into New York... WHEELS SMACK down onto the runway at JFK. CUT TO: A PHOTOGRAPH OF DUNCAN PULL BACK and see it's his passport, held by a US CUSTOMS OFFICER. He lowers the passport and turns to the long metal case Duncan's brought with him from the plane. CUSTOMS OFFICER Would you open the case, please? Duncan hands the Officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and opens it. Inside is an old, meticulously cared-for Japanese KATANA SWORD. Customs Officer studies Duncan's paperwork, smiles. CUSTOMS OFFICER (cont'd) Get much use for this? DUNCAN You'd be surprised. Duncan shuts the case and continues on. Next MAN in line watches Duncan exit as he hands over his passport. Hang on the PHOTO. We'll remember those steel- gray eyes. INT - CAB, DRIVING - DAY Duncan watches the passing scenery. MUSIC and LANDMARKS familiar from the first "Highlander" sweep past. EXT - NEW YORK SIDE-STREET - DAY Cab WIPES FRAME, leaving Duncan standing before the charred husk of Connor's antique store. Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the investigators have long since come and gone. INT - ANTIQUE STORE Door SPLINTERS OPEN. Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been spared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home. Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing AN INNER DOOR deliberately hidden from view. He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door. ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling. Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform. He pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages. Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity. TRANSITION TO: INT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAY Duncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows. Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times. Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier. A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries. CONNOR You've improved greatly. DUNCAN You really think so? Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other. CONNOR No. I'm just being gracious. Duncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade. CONNOR (cont'd) Remember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders. Duncan lunges again. Misses and hits the deck. CONNOR (cont'd) Which in your case might not be long at all. He puts his blade to Duncan's neck. Humor evaporates. CONNOR (cont'd) What we give up to our adversary in defeat, Duncan... is evervthinq. Duncan stares up at him, uncomprehending. CONNOR (cont'd) We call it "The Quickening"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend. It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest. He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. CONNOR (cont'd) Survival. Learn it. Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger. DUNCAN (whirls around) You mind?! Connor clucks his tongue. CONNOR (cont'd) Allow me. He squares Duncans shoulders and steps back. Considers. CONNOR (cont'd) Unh uh. He steps up and swivels Duncan around until hes facing the opposite way. CONNOR (cont'd) If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade... just keep this in mind. He proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat. CONNOR (cont'd) It's a coup de fin. He catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile. CONNOR (cont'd) Properly executed, even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark. DUNCAN Properly executed, we'll never have this talk again. Duncan and Connor's eyes lock. They break. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - CIRCULAR ROOM Duncan suddenly SIEZES UP with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as THE BUZZ. It's the sense of another Immortal. He swings around, reaches for his katana and steps back through the door, swinging it closed as A YOUNG WOMAN appears at the top of the stairs. She saunters toward him, glancing around. She takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to Duncan. The ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty. Like a post-nuclear Barbi doll. Duncan regards her, intrigued and wary. DUNCAN Who are you? YOUNG WOMAN A friend. Those two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the phone. YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd) Or lover. Or wife. Take your pick. Memory jogs with a sudden lurch. DUNCAN Kate? YOUNG WOMAN Atta boy. 'cept I'm "Faith" now. Part of the makeover. Like it? She runs a playful finger across his chest. FAITH Funny how 'the time slips by, huh? You wake up one day and ohmigod-- Airplanes! DUNCAN Why're you here? FAITH Remember our wedding day, Duncan? I do. She takes him by the hands and leads him into an impromptu dance. FAITH (cont'd) We danced the "Highland Fling." She spins under his arm, circles back into his embrace. FAITH (cont'd) I felt like we were flying. Her sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his. FAITH (cont'd) And that we'd never come down. She spins out of his arms again-- --and SPIN KICKS him across the FACE. BLOOD spatters from his nose and mouth. FAITH (cont'd) Of course, we did come down. Didn't we? (kicks him again) Crashinq. Duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion. Recovers. They stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide. DUNCAN (spitting blood) Why are you here? FAITH Isn't it obvious? I wanted to see you again. Duncan tenses at-- THE ROAR OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. His eyes track the SOUND. It's directly BELOW him. EXT - STREET OUTSIDE ANTIQUE STORE THREE MOTORCYCLES hop the curb, SLICE through the open door to the antique store... INT - ANTIQUE STORE . . . and SPIRAL up the BACK STAIRS. INT - LOFT Duncan's eyes flick upward to a NEW SOUND, directly above him as-- EXT - ROOF - DAY A FOURTH BIKE VAULTS the NARROW GAP between buildings and LANDS. Knobby tires SLAM onto the rooftop, squirrelling wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop. A jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop. Biker suddenly BACKWHEELS around, BLASTS through the ROOF ACCESS DOOR and disappears inside. TWO MORE BIKERS follow suit, SLAMMING DOWN onto the roof like alien invaders. INT - LOFT Duncan reacts. But it's not just the full-throttle howl of approaching bikes. It's the BUZZ of approaching IMMORTALS. THE BIKERS now crest the stairs and fan out into the loft-- Same group we saw outside the monastery. Tricked out in everything from Keds to chainmail, they drag a variety of weapons in their trailing hands-- sword, baseball bat, mace, dao and chain-whip. The tips make a scraping noise across the floor that's deliberately unsettling. They surround Duncan, cutting off any avenue of escape. Nobody moves or speaks. Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke engines. Duncan takes a step backward. Looks to Faith. DUNCAN Who're they? FAITH More friends. PAN THE FACES. CARLOS from Bed-Stuy, BUG from Kyoto, WINSTON from Jamaica, SARGE from Shreveport and CRACKER BOB from nowhere in particular. And then there's CALVIN. A swaggering Immortal from the he's traded brute force in on a brand new weapon of choice. A DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA. CALVIN Make it pretty now. It's the bottom of the ninth. BIKERS DISMOUNT and CONVERGE on Duncan, swinging their weapons to limber up. Duncan backs away. This is unheard of-- Immortals packing like jackals. DUNCAN What-- it's a team sport now? CALVIN (zooming in) Whole new ballgame. THREE IMMORTALS ATTACK. They're good. Duncan's better. About three times better. CALVIN jockeys his camcorder-- GOES IN TIGHT on Duncan. CALVIN Sup with the new blood, huh? Who's gonna lay him out? Take his secret sauce? (swivels around) YOU, Winston? WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, stands off to one side watching, the lone holdout. CALVIN (cont'd) Nope. Too proud. Old school. INTERCUT - VIDEO VIEWFINDER Image lurches and jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants. CALVIN (O.S.) How 'bout you, Carlos? You good for it? Carlos--? CARLOS HURTLES THROUGH FRAME. Lands hard. CALVIN (O.S.) I'll catch you later. SWISH PAN TO: SWORD sparking off chainmail. HANDS AND FEET pounding flesh. BODIES slamming into walls. BLOOD. MAYHEM. PAIN. And Calvin, catching it all, up close and personal. CALVIN (cont'd) Sarge is down. Cracker Bob's down. But Carlos got some kick. Still got some kick. Carlos crawls to his feet, oozing blood and spite. CALVIN (cont'd) Like the man says, you gotta play with the small hurts. Carlos LUNGES-- Duncan lays him out flat again, then swivels around to face-- BUG who straightens up to his full five-foot frame. CALVIN (cont'd) Say hello to my man BUG and his ugly- stick. Bug brandishes a simple metal ROD with a woven grip. Nothing much to speak of... Until he squeezes the grip-- --and SIX BLADES EJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY. The two on each end are SWORD BLADES, one for piercing, one for slashing. Jutting perpendicular to the shaft, like an insane Swiss Army knife, are twin sets of DAGGERS-- two for stabbing and two sawtoothed SWORDBREAKERS. And then there's the shaft itself, if you're in need of a good old-fashioned battering ram. CALVIN (cont'd) Like it? Came from a Tamaric swordsmith. (grins) Who smoked a lotta very wicked stuff. Bug opens up a multi-pronged BARRAGE on Duncan. Duncan adapts to the first assault-- only to find himself reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves. CALVIN (cont'd) Uhp--- Say welcome back to Carlos... Carlos cuts in yet again, swinging for the stands. He fans several times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back onto the floor. Duncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins. But this time as he SQUEEZES the release mechanism-- --Duncan KICKS IT, shoving it flush against Bug's chest. SNICK SNICK two PIVOTING DAGGERS slice into the dumbstruck Immortal. He falls backward WAILING like a stuck pig. A BOOMING VOICE freezes everyone in their tracks. VOICE That's enough. All eyes converge on: THE STRANGER who stands at a distance, cloaked in murky halflight. STRANGER I'm sorry, Duncan. When it comes to discipline, the first hundred years are the hardest. Duncan lowers his katana, turns to the Stranger as-- CARLOS painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly BULLDOZES Duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows. Duncan's launched AIRBORNE in a plume of shattered glass, still clutching his katana. Carlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches with unvarnished satisfaction as the body SPIKES onto an upright iron ROD jutting from the construction site below. STRANGER What was that? CARLOS (squinting) Full gainer with a quarter twist. Degree of difficulty-- not very. STRANGER I thought I told you to stop. CARLOS Yeah, well. I stopped. STRANGER (cont'd) Are you challenging my authority? Carlos does his best to ignore him. STRANGER (cont'd) Because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me. CARLOS (turns away) Hey hey, take it easy, man. STRANGER (cont'd) Is that clear? In the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window, the Stranger is right there in his face. CARLOS Shit! STRANGER IS THAT CLEAR? Stranger takes Carlos' sword and yanks it uo to his own neck -. STRANGER (cont'd) Here's your chance. Carlos stares wide-eyed. Pride won't let him back down. Fear won't let him proceed. STRANGER (cont'd) Take it. You won't have another. We can FEEL the SUDDEN HAMMERING of Carlos' HEART. CARLOS You're crazy, man! STRANGER Am I? Then go ahead... (rubs his neck across the blade) Stop the madness. CARLOS Hey-- STRANGER Or walk away... in perpetual fear of your own shadow. (beat) Tell me, Carlos. Can you live with that? Can you live with the fear? Can you live with the weakness? THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-- STRANGER (cont'd) Weakness, Carlos. Isn't that why you're here with me? Isn't that why youre ALL here with me?! Face it, you're nothing but. . . (savoring) . . . cattle. Blood POUNDS in Carlos' eyes. He YANKS back the sword, CRIES OUT and SLASHES for the Stranger's neck. CLOSE ON STRANGER'S HAND as it catches his wrist and diverts the blade around to Carlos' own throat, wedging it up tight under his chin. STRANGER (cont'd) God loves you. I don't. In one vicious UP-SLICE, Stranger cuts through bone and sinew, stopping just short of a clean sever. Carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest. STRANGER (cont'd) (whispers) They say the worst part, Carlos, is those last few seconds when you find yourself staring at your own headless body. SNICK-- He sends Carlos' head tumbling to the floor. STRANGER (cont'd) Of course it's pure speculation, since nobody ever lives to tell about it. HOLD ON CARLOS' EYES staring in pure, unknowable horror at his own body, twitching several yards away. A tiny ARC of electrical ESSENCE crackles from the neck... THE OTHERS bear mute witness to the GLOWING TENDRILS of ENERGY that stutter across the walls and ceiling. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Duncan lies IMPALED on a JUTTING SHAFT OF RE-BAR as an UNMARKED PANEL VAN screeches INTO FRAME. His eyes stare sightless upward as THE LOFT WINDOWS EXPLODE with unearthly HOWLS of stretching metal and pulverizing concrete. SHOCKWAVES strafe the walls, blowing out mortar and brick. POWER LINES SNAP and LASH against the building, spitting fiery plumes of SPARKS. INT - LOFT Seen from behind, the Stranger absorbs the QUICKENING in a series of wild electro-shock convulsions. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Several darkly-clad MEN jump from the panel van and race up to Duncan. With pit crew efficiency, one takes a mondo set of BOLT CUTTERS to the metal stake while the others grab Duncan by the arms and ankles. A fourth throws open the cargo door. Snap-lift... they TOSS Duncan in the back of the van. INT - LOFT, SAME Arms outstretched and rigid, head thrown back in silent rapture, the Stranger RISES slowly off the floor, suspended Christ-like in the air. BLINDING HALOES of PURE RADIANT ESSENCE engulf him, a lifeforce beyond human understanding. THE OTHERS watch transfixed. They've seen it all before, but it never ceases to amaze and terrify them. CUT TO: DARKNESS Which becomes a harsh blast of LIGHT. DUNCAN'S EYES flutter open, squint at the glare. He's strapped to the same Giger-like chair, immobilized. Standing around him are hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is, essentially, a dungeon. One of them, MATTHEW, steps forward. His steel-gray eyes are familiar. He's the one who followed Duncan through customs. As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _ DUNCAN Watchers? Matthew simply nods. DUNCAN Watchers observe. They don't interfere. MATTHEW True. And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function. Believe me, it's a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center for them. Unfortunately our role has changed somewhat. DUNCAN Why? MATTHEW Because the rules have been broken. DUNCAN Not by me. MATTHEW You're not the one we're worried about. Matthew moves to the other side of the chair. Pegs the arm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings. MATTHEW (cont'd) One of your kind has gone renegade. In doing so he's gained himself a sizeable advantage. One that will be impossible to overcome. DUNCAN Nobody's unbeatable. MATTHEW He's surrounded himself with Immortals loyal only to him. He uses holy ground as a safe haven. And every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just one man. Yes, Duncan. He is unbeatable. Matthew pours a Scotch. Glenmorangie. Holds it to Duncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man. MATTHEW (cont'd) Worse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game. And if he prevails, that perversion will resonate through everything we know. For eternity. In ways we can't possibly comprehend. Duncan tugs at his bonds. Knows what's in store for him. MATTHEW (cont'd) There must always be two of your kind. As long as there are two, and they're kept from fighting, the Prize is safe. The Sanctuary must continue. DUNCAN Get yourself another volunteer. MATTHEW We had a number of "volunteers." Sadly, that's no longer the case. Another WATCHER steps up and forces an IRON FACE SHACKLE down over Duncan's head. MATTHEW (cont'd) You'll be warehoused. Hidden away. So the Prize can remain safe. Duncan struggles frantically against his bonds. DUNCAN You're insane! MATTHEW For the world, Duncan. We do this for the world... The Watcher takes two large BOLTS and begins to screw the mask directly into Duncan's skull. DUNCAN'S POV: BLACKNESS, accompanied by BRIGHT SEARING FLASHES of AGONY. MATTHEW'S VOICE (cont'd) Don't worry. The drugs should kick in momentarily. All external SOUND is slowly DROWNED OUT by the POUNDING IN HIS OWN BRAIN. A POUNDING interspersed with jarring, synaptic flashes of BATTLE. Killing. Dying. Killing again. Dying again. The recycling nightmare finally RECEDES back into NOTHINGNESS. Then, a NEW SOUND. Distant. Grind of metal on bone. Bolts being unscrewed. Iron plate lifts from his eyes, flood of LIGHT. Once again, Duncan SQUINTS up at a FACE. This time, the blurred, swimming features of a familiar Irish-American mug. DUNCAN (WOOZY) Dawson... JOE DAWSON, familiar to many as Duncan's one friend inside the Watchers, smiles back. DAWSON You look like shit. DUNCAN How... long...? DAWSON Week, maybe longer. We can't talk here. (unstraps Duncan) We gotta go. Dawson reacts to the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DAWSON (cont'd) (urgently) Now. Can you walk? DUNCAN Think so. He takes one step and pitches forward onto his face. DUNCAN (cont'd) Potent whiskey. He clambers to his feet and follows Dawson out of the chamber. EXT - ARMORY - NIGHT Dawson and Duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory, an overgrown Cold War relic recently co-opted by the Watchers. They duck some scurrying guards, plow through thick underbrush to A HIDDEN CAR and climb inside. INT - CAR, TRAVELLING - NIGHT DUNCAN You knew about The Sanctuary. DAWSON Just because I'm a Watcher, doesn't mean I'm always in the loop. DUNCAN I don't buy that. Dawson averts his gaze. Stares ahead. DAWSON I really struggled with it, y'know, the idea of keeping guys on ice like that. But I couldn't argue with the logic. Least not 'til they went after you. (squeals hard onto the main drag) Guess that put it a little too close to home. DUNCAN I owe you. Dawson slides Duncan's katana out from under the seat. Hands it over. DAWSON Do me a favor, buddy. Live to pay me back. DUNCAN What happened to the bodies? Dawson winces slightly. Keeps driving. DUNCAN (cont'd) C'mon, Joe. DAWSON Listen-- I got you outta one jam. Don't push your luck. DUNCAN I need to see them. DAWSON They're dead. Trust me. DUNCAN Was one of them Connor MacLeod? DAWSON Yes. DUNCAN Let me see the bodies. DAWSON The heads are gone. You really don't wanna go there. DUNCAN I have to, Joe. I have to know. Dawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop. DAWSON Alright... Alright-- If I tell you, that's it, I'm outta here! You're on your own! I can't be a part of this, OK?! DUNCAN OK. DAWSON OK. Dawson stares at Duncan. A beat, then: DAWSON Fuck. I'm a part of it. He throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road. CUT TO: A VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of a forlorn and forgotten CEMETERY. Nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire. DAWSON It was a Christian burial. Decent. They said all the right words. DUNCAN I can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is. Pull over. WIDE Dawson pulls over. He and Duncan get out of the car. DAWSON Needless to say, with a dozen unexplainable corpses, they had to go a bit off the beaten track. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET From here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble. CLOSER Duncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow incline. DAWSON (cont'd) What do you think you're gonna find when you get up there? DUNCAN I don't know. DAWSON I'm not digging. Get that through your skull right now. Not these hands... CRESTING THE RIDGE Twelve freshly-mounded graves come into view, gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds, each set off by a simple wooden cross. Duncan stops when he reaches the first grave. Stiffens. DAWSON What? Duncan remains frozen, staring, seemingly at nothing. DAWSON (cont'd) My dog used to do that with locked closets. I hate that. DUNCAN Shh. Dawson listens. Nothing but the soft moan of WIND. DUNCAN (cont'd) He's here. DAWSON Tell me I'm not here for a seance. Duncan squints. Feels the BUZZ. Slight, but unmistakable. WHAT HE SEES: A row of stunted oaks, thick and gnarled againt the setting sun. CLOSER. . . Standing against the trunk, silhouette on silhouette, is the ghostly form of a MAN. Barely discernible, his features are hidden in shadow. Duncan slowly approaches the figure. Dawson hangs back, nervous and slightly twitchy. CLOSER STILL... The figure steps up to greet Duncan. Sunlight brightens the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles as he embraces Duncan in the traditional bear- crush of Scottish clansmen. DUNCAN Sorry I missed your funeral. CONNOR All told, it was a bit underwhelming. DUNCAN So it would seem. They break. The brief joy suddenly drains from Connor's face-- his eyes speak of diffuse, faraway suffering. CONNOR Why are you here? DUNCAN Ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab. Connor's expression hardens. CONNOR You need to know something... He steps up to Duncan, locks eyes. CONNOR (cont'd) Every life I touch ends. Brutally. And for no reason. It's a curse that's followed me for centuries. I can't outrun it and I can't outlive it. (beat) You're my last friend in this world, Duncan. I left for your own good. It was better that you didn't know where. DUNCAN The Sanctuary. CONNOR Yes. The Sanctuary. DUNCAN But you escaped. CONNOR No, I didn't escape... FLASH BACK TO THE SANCTUARY as the STRANGER moves toward a shackled Connor MacLeod. CONNOR (V.O.) ...I was freed. As before, the immobilized Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze. CONNOR Who are you? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. CONNOR'S POV - THROUGH THE BOTTOM EDGE OF HIS FACEPLATE All Connor can see is the Stranger's HAND as it reaches down and PULLS THE PIN from one of Connor's arm shackles. The cuff FALLS OPEN. Stranger turns away. A beat later come the unmistakable SOUNDS of SLAUGHTER that fill the room to a DEAFENING CRESCENDO. CONNOR (V.O.) I couldn't see the slaughter. I only heard it. BACK TO CEMETERY: We can still see the agony playing out in Connor's eyes. He turns away, sees JOE DAWSON still standing on the ridge, swatting at the occasional deerfly. CONNOR Who's he? DUNCAN The reason I didn't become your replacement. Dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside down. CONNOR What's he doing now? DUNCAN Sand in the shoe would be my guess. Connor suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to THE NEXT HILLSIDE and the FAINT SOUND OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. He stiffens. CONNOR You were followed. One by one, a HALF-DOZEN MOTORCYCLISTS crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing stop. DUNCAN Yeah. I was meaning to tell you about those guys. Dawson fumbles to put his leg back on. Hops a full 360 as he watches the intruders surround them. TWO MORE approach on foot, following the same path Duncan and Dawson took. One is Faith. The other, The Stranger. Except he's no stranger to Connor MacLeod. Far from it. Connor goes rigid. Breathing stops. His nightmare's finally taken human form. MOVE IN for our first clear look at JACOB KASE striding forward, bigger than death. His is a face hewn by Gods sharpest blade, every angle cold, remorseless, Puritannical. As before, he's clad in basic black, accented by the stark white of a priest's collar. CONNOR (ice) Jacob Kase... Connor edges back his coat. Hand seeks out the grip of his sword. Duncan grabs his arm. DUNCAN Not here. CONNOR Walk away, Duncan. Kase and Faith continue toward them. Connor's rage seems to ratchet up with every step. DUNCAN You're on holy ground. Remember the rules... Pure, radiating hate seethes in Connor's eyes. CONNOR The rules be damned. Kase stops, inches from Connor's face. Cooly regards the sword. KASE Look at you. You'd think after half a millenium, you'd learn to keep that you'd learn to keep that temper of yours in check. Gone is any trace of brogue. He's a fully-assimilated New Yorker now. Connor's fingers tighten around the swordgrip... CONNOR Just tell me where, Kase. KASE If all I wanted was to kill you, you'd have been dead a very long time ago, Connor. Something roils under Kase's controlled exterior. A rage every bit as consuming as Connor's. KASE (cont'd) But your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered. FLASH TO SEVERAL OF GLENFINNAN'S VILLAGERS being MOWED DOWN by Connor's mindless fury. KASE (cont'd) It couldn't even begin to appease mine. FLASH TO KASE as he drops to his knees, gagging blood, RUN THROUGH by Connor's blade. KASE (cont'd) Worst of all, you murdered a man of God. Who raised me as his son. FLASH TO A FATHER RAINEY as Connor brings his sword CLEAVING DOWN on him. KASE (cont'd) ...and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that. AFTERMATH OF MASSACRE Scattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons, leading up to the CORPSE of JACOB KASE. KASE (cont'd) What you never could have expected was that you'd leave behind this one humble servant... Kase's body lies there as cold as the Highland dawn. KASE (cont'd) ...who would trade eternity itself to make you pay. HIS EYES snap open. And we're once again TRANSPORTED BACK TO: EXT - CEMETERY - DAY Kase steps closer, revelling in this moment. KASE Look back over the endless travesties of your life and you'll see me. Always there, waiting in the shadows. (beat) When friends and lovers are wiped from your sight, I'm there. KASE (cont'd) When those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason, I'm there. (kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave) And when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own private hell... (shrugs) Guess who? He walks a full circle around Connor. All the while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan. KASE (cont'd) But if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you're wrong. Very... Very... Wrong. Kase turns back to Faith. Pulls his sword and without warning SLICES it across her throat. Faith reflexively GASPS, stumbles backward, leaving-- A WOOD AND SILVER CRUCIFIX dangling on Kase's swordtip. FOLLOW THE CRUCIFIX as he swings it around and offers it up to Connor. KASE Thought you might be wanting this. I kept it for you... FLASH TO CONNOR'S MOTHER, bound to the stake as Kase rips the crucifix from her neck. BACK TO SCENE: Connor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm. KASE (cont'd) For old times' sake. Kase puts an arm around Faith. KASE (cont'd) Want to find me again, Connor? Just put your hands together... KASE (cont'd) (winks) And pray. He gives Faith a little shove and they both start downhill. THE SURROUNDING BIKERS gun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust. Connor makes no move to follow. Strangely silent and impassive, he's like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword. Duncan puts a hand on his shoulder. DUNCAN Whatever it is... Connor swipes away Duncan's hand, starts walking. DUNCAN (cont'd) I can help you, Connor. Connor stops, swivels back. Eyes dead. CONNOR Nobody can help me. He walks off alone, a ghost against a sea of gravestones, DUNCAN CONNOR-- Duncan watches his friend depart, helpless. Turning back, he sees FAITH AND KASE stopped halfway down the hill. They seem to be arguing. Kase turns abruptly and strides off. CLOSE ON FAITH She stands there a moment, sullenly rubbing her throat. Duncan's VOICE spins her back around. DUNCAN (O.S.) Problem? FAITH I get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me. (dry) Goes a long way back. Their eyes fix on one another. Air thickens. Buzzes with electricity. DUNCAN Just one question. After all these years. . . (re: Kase) Why him? Faith glances down at Kase, who stands waiting at the base of the hill. Considers. FAITH Because I've never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for hate. (beat) Except me. On that, she brushes past Duncan and rejoins Kase. TRANSITION TO: EXT - IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, 17TH CENTURY - DAY Duncan and Connor ride side by side on horseback. They reach a RIVERBANK where a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly CONSORT are detained at a crude wooden TOLL GATE. Eight or nine disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage. Connor rides up to what would appear to be the LEADER. He has the most teeth. CONNOR What's going on? HIGHWAYMAN The lady here refuses to pay her toll. CONNOR Toll for what? HIGHWAYMAN Passage over the bridge. Connor cranes his eyes, upriver and down. CONNOR I see no bridge. HIGHWAYMAN What do you think pays for the bridge? Connor considers, then turns back to the lady with a shrug. CONNOR The man has a point. Despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as FAITH from an earlier era. Her original name is CATHERINE MARY DEVANEY. CATHERINE These men are liars and scoundrels. Theyve preyed upon us three years running. CONNOR This true? HIGHWAYMAN A good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment, Sir. CONNOR Exactly what, may I ask, have you accomplished so far? HIGHWAYMAN (proudly) The tollgate. Duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor. He leans over to the highwayman. DUNCAN Excuse me, but by whose authority do you act? HIGHWAYMAN (holds up scroll) By deed of the King. DUNCAN Might I see that? Highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll. The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate. DUNCAN (cont'd) Does the King always sign his name with an "X"? Highwayman's cronies reach for their swords. HIGHWAYMAN He was in a hurry. All eyes hover on Duncan's reaction. Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment's notice. Duncan tracks them with his eyes. DUNCAN (nods) Busy man, the King. (to Catherine) I suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way. CATHERINE His deed is a fake! DUNCAN That's a matter of opinion. CATHERINE You, Sir, are no better than they! DUNCAN That's also a matter of opinion. (to Connor) Shall we? Connor sizes up his young protege'. Gives a dubious nod. CONNOR Lead on. CATHERINE You can't just leave! DUNCAN You're right... He tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman. DUNCAN (cont'd) Good luck with the bridge. He kicks his horse into a brisk trot. Connor reluctantly follows suit. They cross the river through ankle-deep water. CONNOR I can't believe you gave those bastards your money. DUNCAN It wasn't my money. Duncan pulls a cinched canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his overcoat. DUNCAN (cont'd) It was theirs. RACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit. They hit the river at a gallop, kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water. DUNCAN (cont'd) By the time they reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harms way. The pursuers close the gap in seconds. Connor grins approvingly. Draws his sword and glances over at Duncan. CONNOR Shall we? Duncan FLICKS his own sword, lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical. He nods back at Connor. DUNCAN Let's. Together, they whirl around to face the onrushing horde. THEY BATTLE in the middle of the shallow river. Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals. The spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo. Duncan's improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER. This time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river. DUNCAN suddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger. BLADE whistles past the dumbstruck highwayman's head. Which was not the intended target... . . .as we discover when we follow it's end-over-end flight. . . . . . straight into CONNOR'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND. Connor parries his attackers, drives them backward onto their asses, then swivels around and TOSSES the sword back to DUNCAN, who catches it, ducks the highwayman's next swing and swiftly sends him packing. CONNOR recovers his own sword, which is enough to send the last of their attackers into a full-on, stumbling retreat. They both stand watching as THE CARRIAGE jostles safely across the river. CLOSE ON CATHERINE as she looks back at Duncan. She gives Duncan a knowing smile that's as innocent as it is seductive. CONNOR (watching Duncan) You know that stirring in your gut? It's not just simple lust, my friend. DUNCAN I know... CONNOR Ah, but do you really? MATCH CUT TO: FAITH as she and Kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model convertible. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET Joe Dawson walks up to Duncan. DAWSON I feel like I stepped in on the wrong party. Duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next rise. DUNCAN (quietly) Let's go. CUT TO: EXT - BAR - NIGHT We recognize this place. It's where Connor and Duncan shared a last drink together. Duncan and Joe Dawson now hunch over that same bar, staring into their drinks. DAWSON I swear, the man's a walking ghost. EXT - SIDEWALK - NIGHT FEET pound pavement. DAWSON (V.O.) (CONT'D) Whatever it is he's carrying around inside him, it's like he's dead already. Glare of streetlights rake across Connor's face, his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight. Connor bumps shoulders with a passing PEDESTRIAN. PEDESTRIAN Eyy man-- watch it. He continues on, oblivious. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan turns to Dawson. DUNCAN There are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity. They can't be changed. And they can't be undone. You carry these things to the grave, Joe, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, you'll find some peace there. Some relief, even if it's oblivion. (hollow smile) But Immortals don't die. We just go on reliving our sins. Over and over again. EXT - ANOTHER STREET - LATER Connor stops. Lifts his eyes to the light. A SOLITARY STONE CHURCH stands before him in a bed of crawling mist. It seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight around it. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan downs the last of his drink, shoves off from the bar. Dawson glances warily up at him. DAWSON Where now? DUNCAN There were two places I figured Connor was likely to go. One of 'em was here. DAWSON And the other? DUNCAN You're the "Watcher." You tell me. EXT - STONE CHURCH - NIGHT Connor climbs the steps, presses through the heavy wooden doors... INT - CHURCH . . . and prowls slowly through the dimly-lit interior. Icon SHADOWS loom large and menacing. JUMP CUT: He moves along the stations of the cross. JUMP CUT: He's stalking through the nave. JUMP CUT: Barging into the sacristy. EXT - DAWSON'S CAR, DRIVING - NIGHT Dawson's car screams past with a doppler howl. DAWSON (O.S.) It's an old abandoned church just off Canal... INT - DAWSON'S CAR - SAME Dawson's behind the wheel, gunning through narrow back streets. DAWSON . . . Perfect safe haven for a so-called priest, huh? "Our Lady of Sorrows." (dry) Kinda has a nice ring to it. He fishtails around the next corner. Recovers. DAWSON (cont'd) I'll tell ya this-- if he's going after Kase, he's in for a rude awakening. The man's untouchable. DUNCAN So they tell me. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT Connor stops before the darkened altar, senses BUZZING. THE SHADOWED CRUCIFIX stirs. Arms lift in the darkness. Jacob Kase steps down off the cross, lingers in shadow. KASE I would grant you absolution. If I were a better man. He turns and disappears out the back. Connor follows. Right past KASE'S POSSE OF IMMORTALS scattered throughout the pews, who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to follow. WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, leans over to Faith. WINSTON You know we're next, don't you? Faith lowers the book she's reading-- the Holy Bible. Looks up. FAITH What? WINSTON Our days are numbered. You can see it in Kase's eyes. FAITH Do you believe in a hereafter, Winston? WINSTON All I know is I won't be hereafter Jacob Kase gets through with me. And that's all I care about right now. Faith leans back against the hardback pew, closes her eyes. FAITH Yeah... CUT TO: EXT - REAR OF CHURCH - NIGHT Kase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds, then turns back to Connor. Connor draws his sword, moves on Kase. KASE The ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger. It defiled their sense of purpose. (draws his own sword) Of course they're also somewhat extinct. He steps fearlessly up to Connor, places his neck against Connor's swordblade... . . . just like he did with a certain late Immortal named Carlos. CLOSE ON KASE'S SWORD He opens his fingers and lets the sword DROP. It clatters useless to the ground. KASE Would you slaughter an unarmed man of God again, Connor? Would that finally put your soul to rest? (low, taunting) Then go ahead. Send me home. BLOOD POUNDS with the rage pulsing through Connor's veins. KASE (cont'd) What's stopping you? Guilt? The nagging sense that maybe you, more than I, deserve to die? Dawson's car pulls up in the background. Duncan jumps out. KASE (cont'd) Or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve? Connor's sword digs into Kase's neck. Breaks skin. DUNCAN (approaching) Don't do it, Connor. CONNOR (gritted) Keep back. KASE (to Duncan) You heard him. No Immortal can interfere with another's duel. DUNCAN He's playing you! Step back onto holy ground before it's too late-- Kase faces back to Connor. KASE Go ahead-- what better chance than now? Take your shot. DUNCAN Don't listen to him! KASE Do it. For your sweet mother... FLASH Caiolin burns at the stake. Suddenly startled, KASE (cont'd) Your Huguenot bitch in Navarre... FLASH rears back, THROWS Suddenly startled, the HORSE bearing a FRENCH DUCHESS her to the ground, breaking her neck. KASE (cont'd) Brenda Wyatt... FLASH BRENDA WYATT ("Highlander 1") is seen walking in CENTRAL PARK. A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER MOWS HER DOWN from behind. KASE (cont'd) Rachel Ellenstein... FLASH RACHEL is BLOWN APART in the antique store she shared with Connor. KASE (cont'd) Tell me-- do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire village? BLADE TREMBLES in Connor's hands. Kase presses his neck even harder against Connor's blade. BLOOD trickles down his neck. KASE (cont'd) So close. Soooo close... Duncan stands by, helpless to intervene. KASE (cont'd) Look at you. Even now, you're afraid you'll lose. That's your true fear isn't it? (whispers low, seductive) Oh, it's not the dying, my friend. I know that. That would be a blessing. It's the thought of giving up your essence to me. Making me even stronger by it. One look in Connor's eyes and you know he's right. KASE (cont'd) What's wrong? (almost a purr) Don't you want to be inside me? Connor slowly LOWERS his sword... and FLICKS Kase's discarded sword back up into his hands. Kase simply smiles and takes position. Duncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay. KASE I've taken more heads than you can possibly imagine. His sword whistles across Connor's face, opens a THREE INCH GASH over his eye. KASE (cont'd) Do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings? Connor stumbles backward again, blinded by his own dripping blood. Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he's doomed. Duncan knows it too. And it's killing him to watch. Still Connor won't go down easy. He manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes. Kase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on Connor's torso, crosshatching him in blood. Connor lunges wildly. Kase parries effortlessly. Kase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor. It's like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are Kase's strikes. Constantly off balance, Connor still manages to NICK Kase in the cheek. KASE (cont'd) (touches scratch) I'd almost forgotten what that felt like. Thank you. He now turns it on full. Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip. His eyes go impossibly cold. KASE I want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead. And know that every time you close your eyes, from now to eternity, I'll be there. (beat) Ripping apart the ones you care about most. He removes his sword and steps back. KASE (cont'd) It's not over, Connor MacLeod. It will never, never be over. He turns and walks back toward the church. Duncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump. KASE (cont'd) You, on the other hand, are on borrowed time. He continues on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle. One-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind Kase. Connor stares into Duncan's eyes as if wanting to say something. Can't. Instead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot. Feeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over at FAITH who stands at a distance. Watching him. As their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness. TRANSITION TO: EXT - DUBLIN ROWHOUSE (17TH CENTURY) - DAY A BEARDED BRAWLER CRASHES DOWN onto a wooden table. He takes the table cloth with him as he TUMBLES head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage. Miraculously (unless you're an Irishman) he spills not one drop of precious Guinness, which he hoists in a cheery salute to: THE BRIDE AND GROOM who sit laughing in the eye of an Irish hurricane. DUNCAN MACLEOD and CATHERINE MARY (KATE) DEVANEY-- aka "Faith"-- are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness. Things have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing. BRAWLER Let's have at it! They kiss to a CHORUS of BOOS. So this time they REALLY KISS. Crowd goes wild. AROUND THEM REVELERS DANCE and FIGHT with equal abandon, making it almost impossible to tell the difference. But they stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial. THE BEARDED BRAWLER spears his mug into the air like a royal scepter. BRAWLER Happy is the bride that sees the sun! Sorry the corpse that sees the rain! CLOSE ON BEER MUG framed in a perfect BEAM of SUNLIGHT streaming through an open window. FOLLOW THE SUNBEAM TO: KATE who smiles back with her own inner radiance. Bedecked in flowers, her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin. She leans over RAUCOUS CHEERS and kisses Duncan, provoking a new RIOT of and UPRAISED GLASSES. THE PIPERS resplendent in their Celtic kilts, launch into the "Highland Fling. Kate is instantly YANKED up onto her feet and into a ROUSING JIG. Before Duncan can protest, he's HOISTED from his seat and FLUNG onto the dance floor. Duncan and Kate link arms, goaded on by a circle of shouting, stumbling CLAPPERS. With each new upshift in tempo, they spin faster and faster until they're hanging on for dear life. SIGHT AND SOUND gradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo. But for Duncan, it's not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion. It's the BUZZ of another Immortal. He spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on CONNOR MACLEOD who enters the room on a wave of silence. Duncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps him in a bear hug. DUNCAN About time. I was beginning to wonder. CONNOR I was on a junk in the South China Sea when I got your notice. 12 hours ago. DUNCAN How...? CONNOR Don't ask. Kate spins by on the arm of a new partner. KATE You're next, Connor MacLeod. CONNOR That better be no idle threat. Duncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile. DUNCAN Well, I finally did it! CONNOR So it would appear. DUNCAN What do you think of her? CONNOR You know that's not an easy answer. The edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan. CONNOR (cont'd) Outside. EXT - PORCH - NIGHT Connor stands with Duncan at the railing, staring out into the encroaching night. CONNOR You know she's like us. DUNCAN Yes. I sensed it the day we met her. CONNOR So you know that, like us, her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death. Duncan looks off, as if purging the thought from his head. CONNOR (cont'd) It's what makes warriors of us all, Duncan. Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it. DUNCAN Yes. And without such a death, she'll simply grow old and die like any other. Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me? Connor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest pocket. It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips. CONNOR Many years after I was married, I came home to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other. FLASH TO: HEATHER, early-forties, her hair shorn to the scalp. She looks up at Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter smile. CONNOR (cont'd) At first I was scared. Scared that she'd gone mad. And then angry, as if she'd somehow meant to hurt me by it. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: CONNOR (cont'd) When I asked her why she'd done such a thing to herself, her answer cut me to the quick. She said it was the one part of her that would not age. It would forever remain the same as when I first fell in love with her. FLASH TO: CONNOR burying Heather in a simple grave overlooking their home. Tears streak his face. He sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish. CONNOR (cont'd) And that's how she wanted me to remember her. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: Connor closes his fingers around the braid. Squeezes. CONNOR (cont'd) It's all I have now. DUNCAN I love Kate. I'll hold on to her as long as I can. That's all I can do. Kate can be seen through the window behind them, exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon. CONNOR If that's your intent, so be it. Duncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch. Takes to the ground in long angry strides. EXT - COBBLED STREET - NIGHT Conner walks double time to catch up with him. DUNCAN Why are you telling me this? CONNOR Because I once loved a woman more than life itself. And I watched her die. Unlike you, I had no other choice. DUNCAN And I have a choice?! What would you have me tell her?! CONNOR I'd tell her nothing. She wouldn't believe you. They never do when it involves themselves. DUNCAN Then I can do nothing. CONNOR She's in the flower of her youth. Enjoy the moment and let it pass. If you think you can. Duncan suddenly grabs Connor's shoulder, spins him around. DUNCAN You'd have me kill her?! Is that it?! Is that what you came all this way to tell me on my WEDDING NIGHT?! CONNOR I'd have you do what your heart-- and our conscience-- demand. Duncan settles. Searches his eyes. DUNCAN And if it were you in my place? Connor ponders. Then shakes his head. CONNOR I thank God I never had the choice. He listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising WIND. CONNOR (cont'd) Tell Catherine I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer. He clasps Duncan by the forearm. Then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane leading from the wedding party. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT Duncan lies sleepless in a nouveau-stark hotel room, somewhere in the bowels of Manhattan. A half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company. The door CREAKS OPEN, casting a single ribbon of light across the room. It WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN. Duncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep. She pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed. Duncan remains still, breathing heavily. The woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan-- --then swings her leg up and straddles him. Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair. She says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension. Instead, she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM. Passionately. Duncan responds in kind. AS if powerless to do anything else... LIGHTNING stitches the sky outside as-- They embrace. Bodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the STORM raging outside. ON THE NEXT THUNDERCRACK TRANSITION TO: EXT - EMPTY FIELD (DUBLIN) - NIGHT ANGRY SHEETS OF RAIN rake the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly through calf-deep mud. Still in his wedding arb, he's thoroughly drenched, as if he's been wandering this way for hours. INT - ROWHOUSE - NIGHT The last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale. Only Kate remains upright, her face etched with sober dread as DUNCAN appears in the doorway, rivulets of water pouring off his shoulders and brow. For a while they just stare at one another, each lost to his own sense of foreboding. Kate is the first to speak. Despite her stoic veneer, her voice comes out small and terrified. KATE If this is wrong, Duncan, tell me now. Saying nothing, Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his own. INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT CANDLES flicker in the storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed windows. Kate lays Duncan's rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked for the very first time. Duncan reaches out to touch her. She trembles. Gently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise. Then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut wildflowers. HANDS clasp, fingers dig into skin. Whatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned. She arches up under Duncan, puts her lips to his ear. KATE I'll love you forever. On an OMINOUS THUNDERCLAP-- TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT We're back in the present. Little has changed but the sheets. And the fury of their lovemaking. Each new THUNDERCRACK highlights a different aspect of their hunger-- their wet, glistening bodies STROBING FASTER AND FASTER until the act itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place. FLASH FRAMES stutter inside the lightning: SILKEN HAIR coursing over cream-colored breasts and a simple pewter cross. EYES similar in shape and color, that shift from painted to plain... FINGERNAILS that toggle between neo-goth BLACK and natural pink... FAITH throws back her head, biting back the shudders of release... . . . and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh. INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT A SHADOW darkens Kate as she sleeps. It lingers there, deadly still. DUNCAN stands over her, gripped by indecision. The fateful choice tears at him, even as he holds a DAGGER over her gently-rising chest. His hand TREMBLES. DUNCAN (softly) Forgive me. KATE'S EYES SNAP OPEN as the DAGGER PLUNGES INTO HER HEART. For an instant their eves meet. And in that single shattering moment, Duncan knows he chose wrong. It's not just terror that passes through Kate's eyes. It's the incomprehensible pain of betrayal. Kate gasps once, jerks and settles. Lies there dead, blood pooling across her nightgown. Duncan stares down at her body, numb. DUNCAN I'm sorry... On that look we TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - HOTEL - NIGHT The pain imprints on Duncan as if he's still clutching the knife. DUNCAN I'm sorry. Whatever passion stirred Faith moments before is gone without a trace. Her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead Kate. FAITH You had no right. DUNCAN I was doing it for you. For us. FLASH TO: INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT Kate CONVULSES BACK TO LIFE, eyes wild, insane. Duncan reaches out to her, which only sends her reeling further into panic delirium. She swats at him, punching flailing... DUNCAN Now you're an immortal. Like me. It was the only way... Words fall on deaf ears. She wrenches out of his grip. Stumbles for the door, drenched in her own blood. Leaves Duncan standing mindblown in her wake. EXT - DUBLIN STREETS - NIGHT Kate flees through wet empty streets-- barefoot, nightgown ripped and bloody, face contorted like a madwoman. Breath comes in ragged, whimpering gasps. She trips, falls. Comes up running. BACK TO PRESENT: Faith climbs off the bed, throws on Duncan's shirt, whirls back, tears streaking her face like warpaint. FAITH You wanted this! I never asked for eternity! You forced it on me! (screams) IT WAS MY DECISION, NOT YOURS!! DUNCAN Would you have really understood? FAITH Understood? Which part?! The part about never having children? Or the endless, numbing sameness of it all? (bitter laugh) Or maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize you're nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by so fast they don't even count anymore! She wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons. Duncan remains silent, taking it all in. FAITH (cont'd) Here's the kicker, Duncan. I came here for one reason and one reason only. To see if I could feel again. Anything. She walks out, leaving the door hanging wide in her wake. INT - HALLWAY Faith reaches for the stairwell door as-- --DUNCAN'S ARM LANCES OUT, holding it shut. DUNCAN (leaning in) I'm watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened four centuries ago. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. Because those people are dead and nobody can bring them back. Faith struggles to open the door. Duncan holds firm. DUNCAN (cont'd) But I'm lucky. You know why? FAITH Let go! DUNCAN I'm lucky because my crime can still be forgiven. FAITH LET GO!! DUNCAN As long as you're still alive, there's at least the chance. It could take years. Centuries even. It may never happen... Faith is now PUSHING FURIOUSLY on the door. DUNCAN (cont'd) But at least I can still carry the hope inside me. That's one blessing of immortality. There's always tomorrow. He lets go of the door and steps back. DUNCAN (cont'd) Even for you. Faith shoves her way past him and disappears into the stairwell. CUT TO: EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT CONNOR MACLEOD stands on a ROOFTOP, sword in hand, face upturned to the bitter heavens. Stinging WIND and RAIN slash at his face. He doesn't even blink. CUT TO: EXT - NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT Seen through a CAMCORDER VIEWFINDER, our roving POV wends its way past a couple fixing junkies up to a GARAGE where WINSTON hunkers over his bike making repairs. Kase's church looms in the background like a veiled threat. CALVIN (O.S.) Win-ston. WINSTON Shut that thing off. CALVIN (O.S.) Hey, c'mon. WINSTON SHUT IT OFF! SCREEN BLACKS OUT as Winston slams his hand over the lens, ENDING CAMCORDER POV. Calvin sets it down. CALVIN Awright... WINSTON I'm out. I'm leaving. CALVIN You're out. You're out... You don't g&z out. WINSTON Watch me. CALVIN You saw what he did to Carlos. He's Genghis the fucking Hun, man. You live his way or you die your way. Be grateful you got the choice. Winston looks off. WINSTON We could take him. CALVIN Huh? Say how much you value your life? WINSTON Forty-three guineas. Saw the bill of sale myself. Kingston Jamaica, August 14th, 1813. CALVIN Sorry there, Cinque', but I got a bigger price goin on this unit. WINSTON I watched Connor MacLeod stand up to Kase tonight. Got me thinking. CALVIN What about. WINSTON That maybe my soul wasn't part of the deal after all. Calvin considers his point. CALVIN You really think we can take him? WINSTON The man can't stop a bullet. I know that much. But I need your help. CALVIN Yeah and who takes his head, huh? Gets that bucket fulla lucky charms. You, Mr Cool? (beat) Who's gonna be master then? INSERT - CALVIN'S CAMERA and that little glowing RECORD LIGHT... EXT - RUBBLED CEMETERY - DAWN FOLLOW CONNOR MACLEOD CUT TO: as he reaches the crest of the cemetery ridge. He sags against a solitary windswept oak, slides down until he's sitting cross-legged at the base of the tree. Eyes wide, unblinking. BEFORE HIM stand those TWELVE DEAD IMMORTALS from The Sanctuary, directly over their burial plots. Their heads are missing. CONNOR looks on impassively. Even as-- THOUSANDS MORE now stipple the barren landscape. All headless, in period dress spanning untold centuries. The forgotten casualties of an endless, impossible war. Connor nods solemnly. CONNOR Soon. He blinks. The specters are gone. TIME LAPSE ON CONNOR: DAY becomes NIGHT becomes DAY. And still he sits there, unmoved, as if ready to embrace the rest of eternity from this one desolate spot. TRANSITION TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Connor remains sitting against the tree as A SHADOW slices over him. He slowly tilts his gaze upward. Squints. DUNCAN (O.S.) There's supposed to be an end to all this, right? A final answer... Duncan slides down next to him. Gazes out at the trackless ocean. DUNCAN Isn't that the "prize" we're all butchering each other to win? CONNOR I already know the answer. The "prize"-- the real prize-- is just to close your eyes and see nothing. DUNCAN I don't believe that. CONNOR You think the Game is still about good against evil? A better world? Look around. Who among us really deserves to win? DUNCAN Not Jacob Kase. CONNOR And who's going to stop him? You? Me? DUNCAN There has to be a way. Connor looks off. Nods. CONNOR Oh, there's a way, kinsman. There's a way. But I don't believe you have the guts to take it. DUNCAN Try me. Connor stands up. Offers a hand to Duncan. Hauls him upright. CONNOR Alright then. HE SUDDENLY LASHES OUT WITH HIS SWORD. Duncan barely catches Connor's blade with his own. DUNCAN What're you doing?! CONNOR Don't you know? The better of us will take the other's gift. Pray it'll be enough. Duncan lowers his blade. DUNCAN I won't do it. CONNOR Then you'll die. Again, Connor STRIKES. Again, Duncan barely escapes with his head. And settles into a fighting stance. DUNCAN It can't end like this! CONNOR It already has. Goodbye, brother. He SWINGS FOR DUNCAN'S NECK. Steel RINGS against steel. Clansman against clansman. CUT TO: INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Faith sits in a center pew, head bowed, deep in thought. Or prayer. Hard to tell with somebody like Faith. Kase sits down beside her. KASE You were with him. He curls his nose, as if he can still smell the sin. KASE (cont'd) Woman is a temple built upon a sewer. FAITH Glad I can help you feel a bit better about yourself there, Jacob. KASE Remember what you were when I first found you? A whore. Now look. A liberated woman. FAITH Fuck you. Kase runs a delicate finger across her neck. KASE Be grateful I don't this minute remove your pretty little heafod. FAITH (looks up, cold) Holy ground, lover. It's a bitch, ain't it? CUT TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Two figures dot the faraway ridge as the savage music of their swordplay PEALS out across the barren countryside. MOVING CLOSER, we watch these timeless warriors exchange strikes that would drive lesser men into the ground. Each gifted in his own way, neither gaining full advantage over the other... . . . they both gradually succumb to EXHAUSTION. CLOSER: Connor and Duncan finally lower their swords, panting and spent. DUNCAN (hollow rasp) Enough? CONNOR (barely audible) Enough... And that's as much as either can say as they suck back great gulping lungfulls of air. A little color finally returns to Duncan's cheeks. He mops his face with his sleeve. DUNCAN Next time I won't hold back. CONNOR Nor I. Dragging his sword like a half-ton barbell, Duncan turns and makes his way back toward the "resting tree. CONNOR closes his eyes and HOISTS HIS SWORD... CONNoR (whispered) Remember well, old friend. DUNCAN feels, more than sees, the ONCOMING BLADE. He turns into the ARC of CONNOR'S SWING-- SLOW MOTION He reacts on pure instinct, SWORD LIFTING, BODY PIVOTING with the DRIVING FORCE of CONNOR'S THRUST... FLASH TO: CONNOR TEACHING THAT SAME MOVE TO DUNCAN BACK IN 1627. FLASH BACK TO: CONNOR'S SWORD as it GRAZES Duncans side. DUNCAN'S KATANA SWINGS UP with the same vicious thrust, CATCHES CONNOR UNDER THE CHIN... Connor doesn't flinch. TIME SUSPENDS the instant before blade meets flesh... CONNOR'S VOICE The game is not about survival, Duncan. It's about living. In the end, it's all that matters. REAL TIME-- THE BLADE CUTS CLEAN THROUGH CONNOR'S NECK WITH UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM. Duncan CRIES OUT as he follows through, BLOOD staining his blade with the crushing reality of what he has just committed. He sinks to his knees... . . . and SCREAMS TO THE HEAVENS. The heavens answer back with THUNDER, LIGHTNING and GALE FORCE WINDS that seem to come from everywhere at once. PURE ESSENCE-- --HOWLS out of CONNOR'S BODY. DUNCAN CON-NORRRRRRR!! It SURGES UPWARD into endless SHEETS of LIGHTNING. Duncan CONVULSES at the epicenter of a GROWING CLASH between EARTH and SKY. SHOCKWAVES POUND through his skull, triggering A LAST FLEETING VISION OF CONNOR MACLEOD: Walking with Heather across an open field. He turns and looks back at Duncan. CONNOR'S EYES shine with a look of ultimate peace and transcendence. He seems to be gazing straight into Duncan's soul. And smiling at what he sees as-- A FINAL BLAST OF ESSENCE RIPS through Duncan's BRAIN. EXT - HIGHRISE - NIGHT DISSOLVE TO: Duncan stands alone on the rooftop, stripped to the waist, moving slowly through an elaborate kata. The precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him. He windmills the katana over his head, faster and faster, until he suddenly RELEASES IT-- THE SWORD PINWHEELS through the night sky, arcing out across the open space between buildings... Duncan watches its long, lofting trajectory... . ..then takes off RUNNING. He reaches the edge of the rooftop and LEAPS. WIDE Legs cycling through empty air, he traces a matching arc directly under the far-flung sword. Like a long-jumper stretching for that last inch of sand, Duncan HYPER-EXTENDS for the next rooftop. EXT - NEXT ROOFTOP HIS LEADING FOOT hits the edge-- digs in, pivots and sets. HIS HAND THRUSTS UPWARD as the sword grip SLAPS INTO HIS OPEN PALM. Fingers wrap around the ivory hilt, slowly lowering it down to eye-level. GO IN CLOSE ON THOSE EYES and see a new Duncan MacLeod. Stronger. Deadlier. A man cooly aware of his own destiny. CUT TO: EXT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson's car pulls up to the generic cinderblock building that now stands unguarded and abandoned. INT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson enters, squints into the darkness. The interior looks as if it's stood fallow for the last three decades. No giger-chair, no gothic restraints. No evidence the Watchers ever took up temporary residence here. Except for MATTHEW, who emerges from the stale halflight to confront Dawson. MATTHEW I'm a bit surprised to see you again. All things considered. Dawson just stands there, hands plunged inside his coat pockets. MATTHEW (cont'd) As you can see, we had to move on. Find a new Sanctuary. DAWSON It's wrong. What you're doing. It's inhuman. MATTHEW Ah, but they're not human, really. Are they? DAWSON Gimme a reason, Matthew. MATTHEW It's for the good of us all. You know that. DAWSON Gimme a reason. Matthew cocks his head like the RCA dog. MATTHEW Because we must. It's that simple. And if you get in our way again, there will be very serious consequences. DAWSON Gimme a good reason. Matthew pulls a gun. Aims it at Dawson's heart. MATTHEW I'm sorry to have to do this, Joe. He pulls the trigger... as TWO SLUGS pound into his chest. Matthew topples backward, dead. Dawson palms the gun still concealed in his coat pocket. Nods. DAWSON Reason enough. CUT TO: EXT - NEW YORK STREET - DAY Kase is roaring through narrow streets in a low-slung convertible, Faith at his side. With utter disregard for speed or care, he guns it madly in shrieking turns. INT - CONVERTIBLE, DRIVING Faith grips the dashboard two-handed. FAITH Slow down. KASE Adrenalin's good for the sex drive. FAITH I'm not amused, Jacob. She reaches over and slaps on her shoulder harness. KASE Thought maybe you needed a little more excitement. You know, spice up our relationship a bit. WIDE He OVERSTEERS, caroms off several parked cars, recovers... KASE (cont'd) I mean, isn't that why you went back to Duncan MacLeod? The risk? FAITH I don't know what you're trying to prove. Kase puts an arm around her shoulder... KASE Why do I have to prove anything to you? .... as his foot flattens the accelerator. ENGINE WHINES. KASE (cont'd) I can have anything I want already. FAITH Except me. And that bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it? KASE Not really. AT THE NEXT TURN it's clear he'll never make it, he's going too fast. Kase only smiles. Releasing the wheel, he stands in his seat, lifts his arms above his head and SHOUTS in exultation as-- --the car EXPLODES into the wall. It's all over in a breath. Accordioned metal, drooling radiator, and Faith, slumped over the dash. Kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement, thrown some distance from the wreckage. He's clearly taken the worst of the impact. FAITH stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel and plastic. She reaches back and pulls Kase's sword free of the wreckage. With single-minded determination, she limps over to Kase's body, face-up in his own pooling blood. A disbelieving PEDESTRIAN pauses in shock. Faith gives her a twisted smile. FAITH Don't mind us. Pedestrian SCURRIES OFF as Faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it WHISTLING DOWN across Kase's neck. With inhuman reflexes, Kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same heartbeat. Eyes narrow. KASE Does this mean it's over? DISSOLVE TO: EXT - KASE'S CHURCH - DAY Kase steps up to the back entrance, alone. THE DOOR hangs slightly ajar, which clearly disturbs him. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Kase enters the main room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their pews. He kicks the first pew, awakens both with a start. KASE Who left the back door open? CALVIN Huh? Kase looks to Sarge. SARGE I dunno. KASE Where's Cracker Bob? He was supposed to be watching the back. Calvin and Sarge both shrug. KASE (cont'd) (sotto) Infants. He whirls, stalks out. INT - SACRISTY Kase enters his dark, cluttered office, SLAMMING the door behind him. FLICKS ON THE LIGHT and stops cold. A SWORD JUTS from a small wooden table... . . . right through CRACKER BOB, who lies skewered to the tabletop. WRAPPED AROUND THE SWORDHILT is Caiolin MacLeods unique silver-and-wood CRUCIFIX. The message is not lost on Kase. BOB'S EYES suddenly flutter open. First thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest. CRACKER BOB Ah-- Ahhh-- AHHHHHHH!! KASE Shut up. He reaches forward and JERKS the sword out of Bob, and with it A SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPER impaled on the blade. It bears just one word, scrawled in Bob's plentiful blood. GLENFINNAN Bob sits up on the table, wild-eyed, as Kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his fingers. CUT TO: EXT - LITTLE ITALY, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT Glitter lights and milling tourists. Row upon row of gimmicky Italian restaurants. INT - ITALIAN RESTAURANT, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT Jacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy backdrop of faux Roman ruins, babbling fountains and plastic holly. It all imparts a whiff of "Last Supper" pomp to the proceeding. Which is not lost on the other Immortals, who glance around warily while eating, as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase. Nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this particular room. CLOSE ON WINSTON He stares into his pasta, beading sweat. BENEATH THE TABLE his fingers curl around the cold steel of a .38 SPECIAL wedged between his knees. He inches the gun upward toward the table rim as... Kase suddenly stands up in the center. KASE A toast... All heads turn. Gun freezes in Winston's lap, just hidden from view. KASE (cont'd) I see tonight as a celebration of the spirit. (raises his glass) Here's to all of you who continue to stand by me... (smiles at Winston) . . . even those who might waver at times. Winston stiffens, fears that Kase is on to him. And when Calvin averts his gaze, he knows. Still, he raises his glass. As do the others. KASE (cont'd) You are my flock. You nourish my soul. It's now or never for Winston. His moment of truth. Kase's eyes slowly drift over to meet his. SLOW MOTION, Kase tips back his glass and drinks, eyes locked on Winston. Winston responds in kind, gulping down his wine as he slips the gun back into his pocket. He shoves off from the table. WINSTON Excuse me. KASE Where you going? WINSTON Toilet. KASE Sit sit. I'm not through with my toast yet. WINSTON Can't wait. He angles for the door. KASE I'm almost finished. Sit. Winston reaches for the doorknob. Locked. He swivels back. Sees death in Jacob Kase's eyes. His death. KASE (cont'd) It'll all be over in a few more seconds. A cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them... . . . as Kase continues. KASE (cont'd) Youve all been a part of a great quest. A four hundred year quest for justice. He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword. KASE (cont'd) And here, my friends, is the instrument of that justice. It's called the "Colichmarde." Finest sword known to man. The blade WHISTLES upright. KASE (cont'd) Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood. I only break it out for special occasions. He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and quillons. KASE (cont'd) It sings like an angel. Just listen. Winston jerks for his gun. In a SUDDEN BLUR of STEEL and BLOOD, Kase beheads Winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding efficiency. TONGUES OF LIQUID ENERGY coil up and around Kase's body. But he keeps right on coming. The others scatter like roaches. ESSENCE PULSES off walls and ceiling, SHATTERING STATUARY, HURLING FURNITURE... . ..before MERGING with the WALKING INFERNO that is now Jacob Kase. His sword BLAZES through the remaining victims, trailing STREAKS OF BLUE FIRE. One after another, they drop headless to the concrete, triggering A FULL-ON MULTIPLE-QUICKENING. THE NEXT WAVE OF ESSENCE SLAMS into Kase front on. His knees BUCKLE. ANOTHER Hits him BROADSIDE, buffeting him one way as YET ANOTHER POUNDS him from the opposite- side, rocking him back center and IMMOBILIZING HIM inside an omni-directional CRUSH of LIGHT AND SOUND that WHITES OUT THE FRAME. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY A THICK CLINGING FOG, enshrouds the rocky highlands. Somewhere along the invisible coastline below, a foghorn MOANS. The skeletal remains of an ancient Gaelic CASTLE loom spectral gray above JACOB KASE who stands before an ANCIENT CELTIC MONOLITH (familiar from Glenfinnan's town square) revelling in the changeless land of his birth. KASE (calling out) Where else could stir the blood of a Scotsman too long of this earth and too far from home? Kase picks his way across the uneven ground, unable to see beyond the reach of his own arm. KASE (cont'd) (filling his lungs) I can nae get enough of it. He draws his sword, extends it outward until the tip disappears from sight. A LOW SCRAPING OF METAL ON STONE taunts him from somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness Kase's sword TWITCHES toward the SOUND. Just the FAINTEST OUTLINE of a FIGURE COALESCES BRIEFLY inside the fog. KASE Ah, what's this? Hamlet's ghost? The FIGURE melts back into silent nothingness. KASE (cont'd) I'm afraid even the cloak of fog won't help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage. A DIFFERENT SCRAPING SOUND spins him around to see ANOTHER GHOSTLY FIGURE looming over him from a narrow stone outcropping. Kase masks a slight tinge of concern. KASE (cont'd) It's always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common cause. But I hope you haven't sunk to the level of a simultaneous ambush. Once again, the figure steps backward into the enveloping fog. Disappears. Slightly unnerved, Kase jerks around. No sign of anyone. Just that infernal mist. A SOFT SCRAPING of SWORD against ROCK swivels him back around to his original position. CLOSE ON KASE His nerves are starting to shred. He turns several full rotations, craning for a glimpse of his tormentors. And then he sees it... AN APPARITION WIELDING A SWORD. Kase LUNGES for it. And this time, it doesn't retreat. Swords CLANG in thunderous overture as TWO SPECTRES IN THE FOG battle for position on tenuous footing. KASE drives his adversary backward into a BLUNTED STONE WALL, leaving him no avenue of escape. Their swords LOCK UP and Kase suddenly finds himself FACE TO FACE WITH-- DUNCAN MACLEOD. You can sense Kase's bitter disappointment. KASE Not at all who I'd hoped for. CLOSE ON DUNCAN'S EYES as they flick to a point iust behind Kase's head. CLOSE ON KASE'S EYES as he realizes he's been had. He SWINGS FULLY AROUND TO FACE CONNOR-- --and sees that NOBODY'S THERE! Too late-- he SWINGS BACK TO DUNCAN-- and IMPALES HIMSELF ON DUNCAN'S SWORD. DUNCAN (through clenched teeth) I'm afraid Connor couldn't be here. But don't worry, he's with us in spirit. Still gripping his sword two-fisted, Duncan seems to surge with newfound strength. DUNCAN He gave himself for this moment. And I shan't let him down. Duncan SHOVES OFF from Kase and goes to work on him with a VENGEANCE. WHAT KASE SEES: A frightening, hallucinitory vision of a DUAL ADVERSARY-- one that CHANGES back and forth in the flux of swirling mist. As Duncan's blade BLURS PAST, Kase sees CONNOR. With the very next SWING, he sees Duncan again. Then Connor. Then Duncan. Connor. Duncan... Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand. Shakes it off. Can't be. Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling combinations, then goes inside, tough and ugly. Kase seems suddenly overwhelmed, physically and mentally, as he's driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive. Duncan SLASHES DOWN for the killing blow, which Kase BARELY DEFLECTS. He SLASHES AGAIN. And AGAIN. Each time Kase barely escapes with his head intact. Duncan keeps up this relentless barrage, hacking down in every conceivable direction, looking for an opening, finding none. With each increasingly-leaden DOWNSTROKE, Duncan is losing strength... . . . and Kase is regaining his. Kase BATTLES BACK TO HIS FEET, deftly siezes the advantage. KASE (savage smile) This is not a game won on points, I'm afraid. He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of his superior ability. In a single massive THRUST, Kase STRIPS Duncan's sword and sends him flying. Duncan lands on his back, weaponless. Kase steps up to the katana, scoops his toe under it and FLICKS IT BACK TO DUNCAN. Then waves him back to his feet. A cat playing with his prey. Both combatants square off... and RESUME. KASE That's the beauty of eternity. The fun never stops. He THRUSTS-- spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder. Duncan hangs up on the blade, unable to move. Grimaces in pain. Setting boot to chest, Kase KICKS Duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling backward. Duncan reaches out to break his fall-- --but there's no ground beneath him. He PLUMMETS OFF a SLANTED CLIFF. Bounces at fifty feet, then tumbles clear to the bottom. Kase steps up to the edge, scowls. A FRESHLY-CUT QUARRY has been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern technology. EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT several stories tall lines the inner basin. KASE What have they done to my mountain?! He gazes down at DUNCAN'S BODY sprawled at the base of the cliff. Then starts down after him. EXT - BOTTOM OF QUARRY - DAY Duncan crawls over to his sword... . . . as Kase picks his way down the steep incline. Duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright. One look at his battered body and you know this fight is over. He just stands there, hunched over his sword, grimly waiting for Kase to reach him and deliver the killing blow. It doesn't take long. Kase stops, regards him with contempt. KASE Don't make it easy. I hate that. DUNCAN Youre breaking my heart. KASE Pick up! Duncan shakes his blood-streaked head. KASE PICK UP! DUNCAN It's always been too easy for you, Kase. No reason this time should be any different. He plucks his sword out of the ground... . . . and TURNS HIS BACK TO KASE. DUNCAN (cont'd) Take your best shot. He hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side. Kase starts TREMBLING WITH RAGE. KASE MACLEOD! Duncan ignores him, keeps walking. About now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind. But Kase doesn't have a clue. DUNCAN'S POV: For a fleeting moment, Connor stands before Duncan, more mist than flesh. He opens his arms wide. CONNOR'S APPARITION Remember weil, old friend. He DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder... KASE (cont'd) MAC-LEOD!! . ..and CHARGES... Which is exactly what Duncan expected. USING THE SAME MOVE CONNOR TAUGHT HIM-- --Duncan PIVOTS WITH the THRUST, catching Kase completely off guard and off balance. This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan's sword from hitting home. He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE... . ..and FOLLOWS THROUGH. ON KASE: He stands there, head miraculously still intact, a look of bewildered relief. Duncan simply POPS his sword butt into Kase's face. The head comes easily away from the neck and falls. KASE'S POV spins END OVER END through the air, bounces twice and comes to a rest SIDEWAYS. And that's how we first see his HEADLESS BODY, sprawled across the ground. KASE'S SEVERED HEAD blinks with sudden recognition. And now he knows. This is the worst part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity. DUNCAN opens his arms to HEAVES UNDERFOOT. WIDE - THE QUARRY the ULTIMATE OUICKENING as THE EARTH WALLS EXPLODE like a circle of VOLCANOES venting into the center. Duncan CLAWS UPWARD on a GROUNDSWELL OF RAW ENERGY as DIRT, ROCK, ASH and SMOKE OBLITERATE THE BASIN. The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS GRADUALLY SUBSIDE. The dust settles. And the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly SILENCE, blind to its own buried secrets. HOLD on the trailing wisps of smoke as THE GROUND SHUDDERS and DUNCAN'S KATANA BREAKS THE SURFACE. It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE, TWO, THREE MORE TIMES, pulverizing dirt and stone. HANDS FOLLOW, clawing their up way through the loosely- mounded earth until DUNCAN'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR. As if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of Immortal. He rolls out onto the ground, gasping, triumphant. Reborn. One inch at a time, he slowly rises to his feet. As we KEEP ON RISING up into a FIERY HIGHLAND SUNSET. TILT BACK DOWN TO: EXT - HIGHLANDS ABOVE GLENFINNAN Duncan stands over a freshly-dug grave. Onto the simple stone, he's chisled: HEATHER MACLEOD BELOVED WIFE OF CONNOR And beneath it: CONNOR MACLEOD BELOVED HUSBAND OF HEATHER Duncan's eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss. And a comfort in knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity. DUNCAN yours is the greater prize my friend. Welcome home. LINGER ON DUNCAN as we DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO... EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAWN FAITH stands sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River and the insignificant island of Manhattan beyond. Her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin. What remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity. Her faraway eyes BLINK with a sudden, frightening clarity. THE BUZZ sets her reflexes snapping as she SPINS AROUND-- --and CATCHES the COLICHMARDE, handle first. DUNCAN follows, strolling toward her with hands loose at his side. Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade. FAITH (considers) So... what am I supposed to do next -- kiss you or take your head? Duncan steps up to her, smiling enigmatically. DUNCAN The choice is yours. FADE OUT: THE END
THE HUDSUCKER PROXY

                                   September 1992 Draft

                

               BLACK

               No image. A bleak WIND MOANS. HOLD.

               With a STINGING CHORD we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958)

               Lights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS.

               After a beat, the voice of an elderly black man:

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         The's right... New York.

               We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets 
               far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling 
               snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING.

               We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers 
               slip by left and right.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo' 
                         minutes it is. Come midnight it's 
                         gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother 
                         feelin'. The New Year. The future...

               The SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is 
               "Auld Lang Syne."

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to 
                         start one mo' trip 'round the sun, 
                         an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round 
                         be a little mo' giddy, a little mo' 
                         gay...

               We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top 
               is a large illuminated clock.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         Yep...

               We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...All over town champagne corks is 
                         a-poppin'.

               A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Over in the Waldorf the big shots 
                         is dancin' to the strains of Guy 
                         Lombardo... Down in Times Square the 
                         little folks is a-watchin' and a-
                         waitin' fo' that big ball to drop...

               The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant 
               CROWD: "Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!"

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...They all tryin' to catch holt a 
                         one moment of time...

               The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the 
               WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we 
               begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads 
               a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name: 
               "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES." Below it, in neon, the company's 
               motto: "THE FUTURE IS NOW."

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...to be able to say -- 'Right now! 
                         This is it! I got it!' 'Course by 
                         then it'll be past.
                              (more cheerfully)
                         But they all happy, evvybody havin' 
                         a good time.

               We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the 
               clock. The window starts to open.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Well, almost evvybody. They's a 
                         few lost souls floatin' 'round out 
                         there...

               A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge.  
               With the opening of the window, "AULD LANG SYNE" filters out 
               with greater volume.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...This one's Norville Barnes.

               The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps 
               in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on 
               the apron: "HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now."

               He looks with nervous determination into the void.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Let's move in for a closer look.

               The CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...That office he jes stepped out of 
                         is the office of the president of 
                         Hudsucker Industries. It's his 
                         office...

               Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows 
               louder and the WIND blows in his face.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...How'd he get so high? An' why is 
                         he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna 
                         do it -- is Norville really gonna 
                         jelly up the sidewalk?

               Norville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge, 
               preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the 
               CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME.

               We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL 
               THRUM becomes very loud indeed.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Well the future, that's something 
                         you can't never tell about...

               The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare 
               seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES 
               UP: "Nine! Eight! Seven!"

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...But the past... That's another 
                         story...

               OVER BLACK

               The HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE and 
               GRINDING GEARS as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DESTINATION DISPLAY

               On the front of a bus just rocking to a halt. The display 
               says "MUNCIE-NEW YORK."

               LINE OF BAGS

               is being set out on the pavement. A man with the cuffs of a 
               redcap uniform swings one into the f.g.:

               It has a sticker on it: CLASS OF '58, and below an 
               illustration of crossed right and left hands, their thumbs 
               hooked and fingers spread like wings: MUNCIE COLLEGE OF 
               BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.

               After a beat the hand of its claimant ENTERS to pick it up.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               STREET

               FOLLOWING the bag as its owner carries it down the street. 
               He pauses, sets it down.

               YOUNG MAN

               Fresh-faced, eager -- NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at:

               WESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

               The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock 
               shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture 
               window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures 
               board in a great train station, with each of its individual 
               entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new 
               opportunity. On offer are jobs like: PASTRY CHEF, STEAMFITTER, 
               LAY-OUT MAN, GRAVEDIGGER, etc.

               REVERSE

               On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the 
               board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and 
               vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug 
               into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads, 
               bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering 
               board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a 
               prospect they like.

               Norville stands pat, watching.

               HIS POV

               An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.

               NORVILLE

               He brightens.

               BOARD

               We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.

               NORVILLE

               He frowns.

               Around him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply

               CLOSE SHOT - EXECUTIVE

               A middle-aged, mousy-looking man in a conservative suit and 
               wire-rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks to someone 
               O.S. Behind the Executive we see only the skyline of New 
               York City.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         -- So in the third quarter we saw no 
                         signs of weakening. We're up 18 
                         percent over last year's third quarter 
                         gross and, needless to say, that's a 
                         new record...

               TRACKING

               DOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table. Executives line 
               either side. We are APPROACHING the man at the far end of 
               the table, to whom the report is being directed.

               He is late middle-aged, dressed expensively but 
               conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive 
               who drones on.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...The competition continues to flag 
                         and we continue to take up the slack. 
                         Market share in most divisions is 
                         increasing and we've opened seven 
                         new regional offices...

               The TRACK has ENDED IN a CLOSEUP of the man at the end of 
               the table, who still smiles benignantly at the droning 
               Executive. The smile is serene, almost otherwordly.

               This is WARING HUDSUCKER.

               REPORTING EXECUTIVE

               He drones on.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...Our international division has 
                         also shown vigorous upward movement 
                         in the past six months and we're 
                         looking at some exciting things in 
                         R&D...

               The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OFF the droning Executive as the big 
               man's attention apparently wanders; we FRAME UP ON the picture 
               window skyline of New York.

                                     EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
                         Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me 
                         about sub-franchising; we're making 
                         so much money in sub-franchising it 
                         isn't even funny.

               FOLDED-BACK WANT ADS

               A hand with pencil goes down a list of positions, ticking 
               each one: STREETSWEEPER -- EXPERIENCED; LINOTYPE MAN --
               EXPERIENCED; CANTOR (REFORM) -- EXPERIENCED; SPARRING PARTNER -- 
               EXPERIENCED.

               WIDER

               Norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil 
               down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm.

               His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs 
               his coffee with his spoon.

               He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down 
               on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change, 
               turning it inside-out.

               CLOSE ON COUNTER

               As Norville puts all his change on the counter. His hand 
               hesitates; he takes a little of it back. He LEAVES FRAME.

               A waitress's hand ENTERS from the far side of the counter. 
               She clears away the saucer, then the cup -- which has been 
               resting on the want ads. It leaves a perfect brown circle 
               around one entry:

               As we hear the COFFEESHOP DOOR OPENING O.S., a draft wafts 
               the sheet of newspaper off the counter and OUT OF FRAME.

               NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE

               Again LOOKING THROUGH the WINDOW as, O.S., the reporting 
               Executive drones on.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...Our owned-and-operateds are 
                         performing far above expectations 
                         both here and abroad, and the Federal 
                         Tax Act of 1958 is giving us a swell 
                         writeoff on our plant and heavies...

               WARING HUDSUCKER

               looks dreamily out the window. His attention returns to the 
               droning Executive and the benignant smile returns to his 
               lips.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...The news in the money market isn't 
                         good -- it's excellent...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NORVILLE'S BACK

               He walks dejectedly down the street, hands shoved into his 
               pockets.

               A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it 
               this way and that.

               Slap! -- It plasters against another pedestrian, who bats it 
               away.

               The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against 
               Norville.

               He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops, 
               noticing something.

               NEWSPAPER SCRAP

               It is a section of the want ads. One entry is perfectly 
               circled by a coffee stain.

               BACK TO NORVILLE

               He looks up from the paper. There is purpose in his gaze.  
               Wind whips his hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE SHOT - WARING HUDSUCKER

               As the Executive drones on, O.S., Hudsucker is carefully 
               winding his wristwatch.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...Our nominees and assigns continue 
                         to multiply and expand extending our 
                         influence regionally, nationally and 
                         globally. So, third quarter and year-
                         to-date, we've set a new record for 
                         sales...

               Hudsucker looks up from his watch, smiles, runs his palms 
               back over his fringe of hair.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...new record in gross...

               Hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right 
               amount under the suit.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...new record in pre-tax earnings...

               Hudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully sets 
               it in his ashtray.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...new record in after-tax profit...

               He deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at its 
               face.

               The sweep second hand is starting the last revolution that 
               will end at precisely noon.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...and our stock has split twice 
                         this year...

               Hudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...In short...

               Savoring a pause, the Executive looks around the board table.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...we're loaded.

               This draws an appreciative chuckle from the board. It is cut 
               off by:

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Ahem...

               The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the 
               f.g. Beyond him is the length of the board table and the 
               large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and 
               deliberately, and rubs his palms together.

               He swings his chair out.

               He steps up onto the chair.

               The board stares.

               He steps up from the chair onto the board table.

               The heads of the board members swing up in unison.

               Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension 
               loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his 
               sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...Mr. Hudsucker?

               The hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP, as 
               Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the b.g., towards the office 
               building across the street. Its street number tops its 
               imposing entryway in large gilt letters: 285.

               We continue TILTING UP the length of the skyscraper, to reveal 
               a huge clock capping its facade. Above the clock is the 
               identification "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES."  Below the clock is 
               the motto "THE FUTURE IS NOW."

               The huge clock's sweep second hand is just approaching the 
               position that will make the time 12:00 sharp.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As the second hand hits the twelve, the CLOCK TOLLS, the 
               board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker comes flying 
               out.

                                     HUDSUCKER

               SECRETARIAL AREA

               Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building. A secretary sits typing 
               next to an open window, finished pages sitting stacked beside 
               her. As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...

               As Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the 
               stack of papers wafting this way and that. As the secretary 
               turns to look out the window, FREEZE FRAME (wafting papers

               TRACKING

               WITH Hudsucker, the building slipping by behind him. As he 
               yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair. 
               The CLOCK TOLLS.

               FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.

               HOT DOG VENDOR

               on the street, handing a steaming frank to a customer who is 
               handing him some change. As we hear the APPROACHING HUDSUCKER, 
               both men look up. As the CLOCK TOLLS:

               FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.

               PASSERBY ON SIDEWALK

               The man, wearing a fedora, is in the f.g. of an EXTREME LOW 
               ANGLE whose b.g. is the bottom three or four stories of the 
               Hudsucker Building.

               The passerby reacts to the approaching yell, looking up just 
               as Hudsucker ENTERS FRAME.

               FREEZE FRAME to suspend Hudsucker a good twenty feet above 
               the sidewalk, arms and legs splayed, comically arrested. The 
               passerby is frozen in an attitude of surprise and disbelief.

               SUPER the title of the film: THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.

               UNFREEZE to send Hudsucker plummeting THROUGH the FRAME to 
               his rendezvous with the sidewalk, BELOW FRAME.

               DUTCH ANGLE

               The Hudsucker Building lists up into the distance. A woman 
               in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises INTO FRAME AT 
               an OPPOSING SLANT. Looking down at the sidewalk, she sends 
               two dismayed hands to her cheek and screeeeeeeeeams.

                                                       DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

               EXT. TOP FLOOR

               With the LAST TOLL of the CLOCK punctuating the CUT, we are 
               FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window.

               The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING, 
               MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN.

               THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting 
               around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and 
               disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g.

               At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and 
               oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray.

               There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak 
               table.

               One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to 
               his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to 
               his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from 
               his nose.

               We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.

               SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle-
               aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a 
               commanding presence.

               He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his 
               knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members' 
               heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately 
               for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader. 
               Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers.

               Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair.

               He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's 
               ashtray.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.

               The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.

                         He could've opened the window.

                         man was unhappy.

                                     ADDISON
                         He didn't look unhappy!

                         Yeah, well, he didn't look rich.

                         Waring Hudsucker was never an easy 
                         man to figure out.
                              (reminiscing)
                         He built this company with his bare 
                         hands. Every step he took was a step 
                         up. Except of course this last one.

                         Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but 
                         when the president, chairman of the 
                         board and holder of eighty-seven 
                         percent of the company's stock drops 
                         forty-four floors --

                         -- Then the company has a problem.
                         Stillson, what exactly is the 
                         disposition of Waring's stock?

                                     STILLSON
                         Well, as you know, Hud left no will 
                         and had no family. The company bylaws 
                         are quite clear in that event. His 
                         entire portfolio will be converted 
                         to common stock and will be sold 
                         over the counter as of the first of 
                         the fiscal year following his demise.

                         Meaning?

                                     STILLSON
                         Meaning simply that Waring's stock, 
                         and control of the company, will be 
                         available to the public on January 
                         first.

                         You mean to tell me that any slob in 
                         a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy 
                         Hudsucker stock?

               Stillson shrugs.

                                     STILLSON
                         The company bylaws are quite clear.

                         Quit showboating, Addison, the man 
                         is gone. The question now is whether 
                         we're going to let John Q. Public 
                         waltz in and buy 87 percent of our

                         What're you suggesting, Sidney?
                         Certainly we can't afford to buy a 
                         controlling interest.

               that read, "MAILROOM." They burst open as Norville, who wears 
               a mail clerk's leather apron, imprinted: HUDSUCKER 
               MAILROOM/The Future is Now. The hellish mailroom is criss-

               NORVILLE

               standing in front of a shelf of cubbyholes. As we FOLLOW his 
               hand drawing an 8 X 10 envelope across the line of 
               alphabetized mail slots. The envelope is addressed to Max 
               Kloppitt, Jr.

                                     NORVILLE

                         He was on, uh...

               He is COASTING ACROSS the "K" mail slots, finally COMES TO 
               Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max 
               Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others. 
               The envelope will not fit in.

               He frowns.

               He is about to fold the envelope, but notices something 
               stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD.

               Norville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see 
               envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in 
               rapid succession, left to right.

               CLOSEUP - ANCIENT SORTER

               An old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail.

               Without ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed 
               back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking 
               pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his 
               left hand.

               ANCIENT SORTER'S SHELF

               As his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots.

               NORVILLE

               He raises his voice over the mailroom din:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Say, what do you do when the envelope 
                         is too big for the slot?

               The ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking 
               his mail.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Well... if ya fold 'em, they fire 
                         ya...

               Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         ...I usually throw 'em out.

               Norville takes out a pencil and writes on the face of the 
               envelope:

               INSERT - LETTER

               Dear Mr. Kloppit, Please give this letter to your son. Thank 
               you, Norville Barnes.

               After a moment he adds:

               Your friend in the mailroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     NORVILLE
                              (talking as he writes)
                         Just got hired today!

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Terrific.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Ya know, entry level!

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Tell me about it.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I got big ideas, though!

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         I'm sure you do.

                                     NORVILLE
                         For instance, take a look at this 
                         sweet baby...

               Norville is taking an envelope from his pocket and handing 
               it to the Ancient Sorter.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...you look like you can keep a 
                         secret...

               The Ancient Sorter is pulling a ragged piece of paper from 
               the envelope. On the paper is a crudely-drawn circle.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Something I developed myself.  
                         Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs.

               The Ancient Sorter looks questioningly from the circle to 
               Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (explains)
                         ...You know, for kids!

               The Ancient Sorter nods with feigned understanding as Norville 
               takes the paper back.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Terrific.

                                     NORVILLE
                         So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom 
                         long.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                              (deadpan)
                         Nooo, I don't guess you will be.

               He resumes his sorting.

                                     NORVILLE
                         How long've you been down here?

                                     ANCIENT SORTER

               A BELL CLANGS.

               The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SPUTTERS to life.

                                     PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         Attention Hudsucker employees.  We 
                         regretfully announce that at 12:01 
                         this afternoon, Hudsucker time, Waring 
                         Hudsucker, Founder, President, and 
                         Chairman of the Board of Hudsucker 
                         Industries, merged with the infinite. 
                         To mark this occasion of corporate 
                         loss, we ask that all employees 
                         observe a moment of silent 
                         contemplation.

               All HUBBUB ABRUPTLY STOPS and the sounds of HEAVY MACHINERY, 
               HISSING STEAM PIPES, and GENERATORS WIND DOWN TO leave total 
               SILENCE. After a moment:

                                     PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         ...Thank you for your kind attention. 
                         This moment has been duly-noted on 
                         your time cards and will be deducted 
                         from your pay. That is all.

               The MACHINERY GROANS back INTO ACTION and the people return 
               to their jobs just as:

               A STEAM WHISTLE SCREECHES.

               ALARM BELLS go OFF.

               From the PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM:

                                     PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         'Blue letter! Blue letter!'

               The mail room is thrown into pandemonium.

                                     VARIOUS VOICES
                         Blue letter...! It's a blue letter...! 
                         They're bringing down a blue letter!

               One MAN spins to face the CAMERA, his hands pressed over his 
               ears. STEAM JETS and HISSES behind him.

                                     MAN
                         Blue letter!!

               Animated for the first time:

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Jumpin' Jehosephat, a blue letter!

               Mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept out of 
               the crowded aisle to form a clear path running down to an 
               elevator in the b.g.

               With a SIREN SOUND, a light above the elevator goes on.

               The elevator door sweeps open. It reveals a wall into which 
               a four-foot high hinged door is set.

               This door swings open and an old dwarf emerges: Old man 
               HUTCHINSON, the boss of the mailroom. He emerges from the 
               blinding light of the interior of the elevator.

               He is holding aloft a letter.

               He takes loping drawf strides down the aisle.

               CLOSEUP - LETTER

               TRACKING ON letter as Hutchinson bears it along. In the b.g., 
               the faces that the letter passes are agog.

               CROSSCUT the approaching blue letter WITH: Norville and the 
               Ancient Sorter.

               BACK TO SCENE

               The Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's 
               ear.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         It's a blue letter... top, top 
                         level... confidential communication 
                         between the brass... usually bad 
                         news... they hate blue letters 
                         upstairs... Hate 'em!

               Norville gulps.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         You!

               Norville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has 
               disappeared.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         ...Yeah, you! Barnes!

               As he points, the people around Norville shrink away.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         ...You don't look busy! Think you 
                         can handle a blue letter?
                              (laughs sadistically)
                         ...This letter was sent down this 
                         morning by the big guy himself! 'At's 
                         right, Waring Hudsucker! It's 
                         addressed to Sid Mussburger!  
                         Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a 
                         blue letter! That means you put it 
                         right in Mussburger's hand. No 
                         secretaries! No receptionists! No 
                         colleagues! No excuses!

               DRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts 
               the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it 
               with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we 
               are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face.

               COMPLEMENTARY TIGHT DUTCH ANGLE ON HUTCHINSON

               We can see the veins in his eyes, the veins in his nose, the 
               hairs in his ears.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         Mussburger!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEVATOR DOORS

               ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator 
               who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform, 
               white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched 
               onto his breast pocket.

               As Norville enters the elevators:

                                     BUZZ
                         Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got 
                         the fuzz...

               He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then 
               lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his 
               head.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...I make the elevator do what she 
                         duzz!

               He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he 
               snaps it away and pats down his crewcut:

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Hang it up to dry.

               He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's 
               knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed 
               to it.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...What's your pleasure, buddy?

                                     NORVILLE
                              (regaining his balance)
                         Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --

                                     BUZZ
                         Forty-four, the top brass floor say, 
                         buddy! What takes fifty years to get 
                         up to the top floor and thirty seconds 
                         to get down?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I --

                                     BUZZ
                         Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
                         Say, buddy!

               With a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator 
               to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia, 
               painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator.

               Buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter.

                                     BUZZ
                         Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, 
                         personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven.

                                     MR. LEVIN
                         Thirty-six.

                                     BUZZ
                         Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen, 
                         step to the rear; here comes 
                         gargantuan Mr. Grier.

               An obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar:

                                     FAT MAN
                         Buzz.

               Buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator 
               into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks 
               only a little under the G-force.

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid 
                         businessman on the street?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I --

                                     BUZZ
                         Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!
                         Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk 
                         fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' 
                         Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!

               He turns to look at Norville.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun, 
                         it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on 
                         Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a 
                         blue letter?!

               All heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those 
               near Norville shrink away.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a 
                         guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express 
                         to the top floor!

               The ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEVATOR DOORS

               Sweeping open. Norville staggers out.

                                     BUZZ
                              (hissing)
                         Good luck, buddy!

               The door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around.

               Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again.

                                     BUZZ
                         -- You'll need it!

               The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES SCREAM 
               as it power-dives away.

               Norville turns toward the executive offices.

               Plush, thick-carpeted silence.

               Norville starts walking.

               A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive 
               quiet. Norville looks to one side.

               A workman in painter's overalls squats in front of a pair of 
               heavy oak doors. With a razor blade he is scraping off the 
               name "WARING HUDSUCKER."

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Mr. Mussburger's office?

               The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville.

               With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction.

               Norville enters the adjacent office.

               OUTER OFFICE

               Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office. 
               The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the 
               f.g., her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder, 
               as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious 
               sneer which stays pasted on throughout.

               The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated behind 
               a desk in the b.g. that flanks the door to Mussburger's 
               private office. The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped 
               on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered 
               down-from-under look of a patient vulture.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Do you have an appointment?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Uhh, no, I --

               The filing secretary sneers.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm?

               She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed crinkly 
               pages.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in 
                         the --

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         We don't seem to be in the boooook.

               Norville is groping in his apron pocket.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No, ma'am, ya see I don't have an --

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         If we had an appointment we'd be in 
                         the booook.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I know but ya see I have this -- 
                         here it is, this letter --

               A low, unearthly WAIL fills the room, the sound of a million 
               souls moaning in purgatory.

               The Receptionist looks up.

               FAST TRACK IN ON SNEERING FILE SECRETARY

               who is no longer sneering. Her mouth is stretched wide as 
               she wails and her finger points...

               FAST TRACK IN ON BLUE LETTER

               that Norville holds innocently at his side.

               BACK TO TRACK IN ON WAILING SECRETARY

               As her wail becomes deafening and we TRACK INTO her mouth 
               and the SCREEN GOES BLACK and:

               CLICK

               The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound 
               of a DOOR OPENING. We are:

               INT. MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

               its door swinging open to admit Norville.

               In the b.g., in the outer office, we can see the filing 
               secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag 
               draped across her forehead. The Receptionist is fanning her 
               with a towel.

               The door closes behind Norville.

               We hear a rhythmic CLICK-CLICK-CLICK and the HUM of 
               VENTILATION.

               NORVILLE'S POV

               Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which 
               is a large executive chair facing the window. From above the 
               back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up. A telephone cord 
               snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden from 
               us. On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large 
               swinging ball bearings. Click-click-click.

               A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in the 
               far corner of the office.

               A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the 
               Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES by 
               immediately outside the window, describing an arc that throws 
               a moving shadow across the office.

               His BACK TO us, into the phone:

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         -- Sure sure, Parkinson's stupid but 
                         he's ambitious, too hard to control...

               He swivels around to face Norville, who stands deferentially 
               at the door. Still listening at the phone, Mussburger waves 
               Norville forward.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...No! Not McClanahan; sure he bungled 
                         the Teleyard merger, but that means 
                         he's got something to prove...

               He covers the mouth piece.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Who let you in?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I --

               Into the phone:

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Atwater? Tremendous. Except I fired 
                         him last week --

               The INTERCOM BUZZES fiercely.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs.

               Mussburger hits the intercom.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Tell him I'll be right there...
                              (looks at Norville)
                         Well, what is it?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I --

               But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from 
               the PHONE.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         You, maybe you're the company's 
                         biggest moron. We can't use Morris, 
                         he's been with us too long, he's a 
                         nice guy, too many friends. Matter 
                         of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- 
                         scratch that; I'll fire him.
                              (looks up at Norville)
                         ...Make it fast, make it fast.

                                     NORVILLE
                         You --

               The INTERCOM SQUAWKS.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Bumstead is getting very --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         I'll be right there. Give him a 
                         magazine.
                              (to Norville)
                         ...What're you, a mute?

               The second PHONE on Mussburger's desk RINGS.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Yeah, how's the stock doing?
                         ...Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough.
                              (into the first phone)
                         ...Look, chump, either you find me a 
                         grade A ding-dong or you can tender 
                         your key to the executive washroom.
                              (into the second phone)
                         And that goes double for you.
                              (into the first phone)
                         Ear-clay?
                              (into both phones)
                         Ood-gay!
                              (slams down both 
                              phones, looks at 
                              Norville)
                         This better be good. I'm in a bad 
                         mood.

               Norville clears his throat.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, sir. I've got something for 
                         you from the mailroom, but first if 
                         I could just take a minute or so 
                         from your very busy time...

               He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper 
               across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at 
               Norville, making no move to take the paper.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...to show you a, uh...

               Norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger 
               will not take it. Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his 
               eyes are locked on Norville's. Mussburger smolders.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...a little something I've been 
                         working on for the last two or three 
                         years...

               Mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look 
               at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at 
               Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You know, for kids! Which is 
                         perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I 
                         claim to be any great genius; like 
                         they say, inspiration is 99 percent 
                         perspiration, and in my case I'd say 
                         it's at least twice that, but I gotta 
                         tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this 
                         sweet baby --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Wait a minute!

               Sudden quiet.

               With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings 
               abruptly stop.

               As Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute 
               and paralyzed.

               His eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk. 
               He stands toe-to-toe with Norville.

               He thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves 
               reflexively back. Mussburger's nose is almost touching 
               Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying, 
               evaluating.

               Finally he draws his head back.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmm...

               With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping 
               mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that 
               his teeth clench it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Umm-hmm...

               He steps back, eyes still on Norville.

               He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair 
               behind the desk.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Siddown.

               Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, 
               looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Go ahead. Try it on.

               Norville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Put your feet up.

               Norville is again reluctant.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Go ahead.

               Norville obeys. Mussburger studies.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmmm... Let's get to know one 
                         another, shall we?

               Norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing 
               from between his teeth. Mussburger seems to relax.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Let's chat!
                              (beams)
                         ...Man to man!

               Norville beams.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...You weren't blessed with much...

               He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a 
               euphemism.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...education, were you?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I'm a college graduate --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         All right, but you didn't excel in 
                         your studies...?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I made the dean's list.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (worried)
                         Hmmm.

               Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke.

                                     NORVILLE
                         At the Muncie College of Business

                              (relieved)
                         Sure, sure. And did your classmates 
                         there call you 'jerk' or...
                              (searches again)
                         ...'schmoe'?

               Norville shakes his head.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 
                         'Lamebrain'?

                                     NORVILLE
                         No, sir.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Not even behind your back?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sir! They voted me most likely to 
                         succeed!

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (curtly)
                         You're fired.

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, sir! --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Get your feet off that desk.

               As he struggles to comply:

                                     NORVILLE
                         But --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Get out of my sight.

               Norville, squinting against the cigar smoke, pulls the cigar 
               out of his mouth as he doubles forward, feet still up, groping 
               for a place to set down the cigar. He sets it blindly on a 
               loose stack of papers.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         My God! The Bumstead contracts!!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               The top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the 
               cigar's live end.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         You nitwit! I worked for three years 
                         on this deal!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         I'll take care of it. Just get out!

               Mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it 
               into a wastebasket. He pats the fingertips of one hand against 
               his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange 
               circle on the top sheet of the contract.

               At the other end of the office, Norville is wrapping his 
               arms around the glass water tank, which he pulls off its 
               base. He runs back across the vast expanse of office toward 
               the desk, hugging the water tank whose WATER GLOOB-GLOOBS 
               out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees.

               As he reaches the desk, the near-empty tank is now light 
               enough for him to hoist with one arm, which he does, and 
               cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water. 
               He tosses the TANK to the floor where --

               CRASH -- it SHATTERS, and stands looking about for a place 
               to dump his handful of water.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed 
                         the most sensitive deal of my career!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk, 
               which Mussburger cannot see.

               It is sprouting flame, at which Norville ineffectually flecks 
               his remaining drops of water.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Now out of here! Out!

               Norville is already running to the window, which he runs 
               both palms over, desperately seeking a way to open it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Not that way! Through the door!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, sir!

               The windows do not open. Norville furiously stomps on the 
               flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks.

               Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up 
               and down with his foot.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Right away, buster! Out of my office!

               Norville has dropped to the floor, trying to wrench the 
               flaming wastebasket off his leg.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Up on your feet! We don't crawl at 
                         Hudsucker Industries!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sir, my leg is on fire!

               Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket 
               off his foot. Now the problem is what to do with it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Get out of this office, you dithering 
                         nincompoop!

               Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               He winds up and throws it through the closed window.

               The GLASS SHATTERS and the flaming basket plummets to 
               oblivion.

               With the picture window broken a FEROCIOUS DRAFT ROARS through 
               the penthouse office.

               CLOSE SHOT - BUMSTEAD CONTRACTS

               On the desk. The pages are sucked away by the draft.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         My God! The Bumstead contracts!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out 
               the window.

               He runs, jumps onto the sill, grabs -- his fist clenches 
               around one wafting page -- he is about to fall --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM

               BUMSTEAD, a short, fat, heavily perspiring executive, is 
               screaming at an O.S. secretary. He holds a pot of coffee in 
               one hand and a copy of Boy's Life in the other.

                                     BUMSTEAD
                         No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger! 
                         I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he 
                         jump out a window too?!

               In the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper 
               fluttering down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NORVILLE

               Desperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. 
                         I gotcha by your pants!

               Mussburger's screaming abruptly stops.

               CLOSEUP - MUSSBURGER'S HORROR-STRICKEN FACE REMEMBERING (THE 
               SCREEN GOES WATERY):

               MUSSBURGER

               is in a basement tailor shop. LUIGI, an old Italian tailor, 
               is just running his tape up Mussburger's inseam.

                                     LUIGI
                         Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you 
                         pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make 
                         'em strong, and they look-a real 
                         sharp.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (barking)
                         No! Single stitch is fine.

                                     LUIGI
                              (begging)
                         But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, 
                         the dooble stitch she last-a forever --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Why on earth would I need a double 
                         stitch? To pad your bill? Single 
                         stitch is fine!

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CLOSEUP OF PANICKED MUSSBURGER

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Damn!

               We hear a LOUD TEARING sound O.S. Mussburger drops a few 
               inches.

                                                             QUICK WIPE TO:

               LUIGI AT HIS SEWING MACHINE

                                     LUIGI
                              (musing to himself)
                         What the heck. Meester Moosaburger 
                         such a nice-a guy, I give him dooble 
                         steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong-
                         a steech-a, you bet!

               BACK TO MUSSBURGER'S PANTS

               The tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops; the rest of 
               the pants hold intact.

               MUSSBURGER

               sighs with relief.

               He looks up.

               NORVILLE

               Norville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the 
               heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face.

               MUSSBURGER

               Looking. Thinking.

               NORVILLE

               Struggling to hold on.

               MUSSBURGER

               Calm. Contemplating.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmm...

               He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks 
               it in his mouth. He holds his lighter under the cigar, not 
               noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way.

               He looks at Norville.

               NORVILLE

               His face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on.

               A PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS, however, 
               that Norville's arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness.

               Mussburger's legs are gone.

               Norville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely -- 
               but CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville is merely 
               pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board 
               members, including Mussburger. They stand around Mussburger's 
               office, laughing gaily. All safe now, no harm done. This 
               inaugurates:

               LAUGHING MONTAGE

               Montage silent but for MUSIC.

               A) Norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of 
               the near-disaster. Mussburger is slapping him merrily on the 
               back.

               B) CLOSE SHOT - Board member laughing.

               C) Another board member. Laughing.

               D) Mussburger. Laughing.

               E) Norville laughing.

               F) FREEZE FRAME ON Norville's laughing face.

               ANGLE

               PULL BACK to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper 
               photo on the front page of the Manhattan Argus.

               Its headline reads: UNTRIED YOUTH TO HELM HUDSUCKER.

               The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary. The sub-subhead reads: 
               Meteoric Rise From Mailroom.

               The article is under the byline of Amy Archer.

               CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that we are looking at the 
               newspaper OVER someone's SHOULDER. The person swivels around 
               and away -- his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville 
               looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs 
               merrily.

               As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto 
               his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK 
               REVEALS that he is in a barber chair.

               His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair 
               is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning --

               -- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again.

               Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a 
               slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade.

               FREEZE ON Norville's laughing face.

               ANGLE

               PULL BACK to reveal it is another front page photo next to 
               the headline: Hud Board To Street: GIVE MAN FROM MUNCIE A 
               CHANCE. Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas.

               CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a 
               chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to 
               cover it.

               PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a 
               tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes 
               his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts, 
               hose stockings and garters.

               The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and 
               spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape.

               Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.

               BOARD MEMBER

               laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching 
               between his hands. He joyously tosses away the tickertape.

               FLOOR

               where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged 
               tape.

               PAN UP to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its 
               disastrous tale of good news for the board.

               PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's 
               office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk, 
               Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper.

               TRACK IN TOWARDS him.

               On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his 
               window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles 
               by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails.

               As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN

               Good Is He?

               TRACK IN ON the front page photo: Norville laughing, his 
               chin propped in his hand.

               PHOTOGRAPH

               COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing.

               We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak 
               desk, newly coifed and tailored.

               The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE 
               OF THE PRESIDENT.

               TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office, leaving 
               Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT.

               His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office.

               Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him 
               exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several 
               days. He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY

               In the skyline we can see the Hudsucker building topped by 
               the Hudsucker clock.

               A cigar ENTERS FRAME in the f.g., then the face of the man 
               smoking it. Staring contemplatively at the Hudsucker building, 
               he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his 
               mouth and waves it, as if painting a headline.

                                     EDITOR

                         a story on him!!

               REVERSE

               shows the Editors glassed-in office filled with REPORTERS 
               for the staff meeting. Although they listen quietly, they 
               are more bored than attentive.

               THROUGH the glass walls we can see the furious activity of 
               an army of reporters, editors, and copy boys waging the never-
               ending battle to put out a quality daily newspaper.

               The Editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust.

                                     EDITOR
                         Facts, figures, charts! They never 
                         sold a newspaper! I read this 
                         morning's edition of the Argus and 
                         let me tell you something: I'd wrap 
                         a fish in it!  I'd use it as kindling! 
                         Hell, I'd even train my poodle with 
                         it if he wasn't a French poodle and 
                         more partial to the pages of Paree 
                         Soir! But I sure wouldn't shell out 
                         a hard-earned nickel to read the 
                         dadblamed thing!

                                     REPORTER
                         Come on, chief, give us a break.

                                     EDITOR
                         Suuuure, Tibbs, take a break! Go to 
                         Florida! Lie in the sun! Wait for a 
                         coconut to drop, file a story on it -- 
                         it'll be more of a grabber than your 
                         piece on the commie grain surplus! 
                         The human angle! That's what sells 
                         papers! We need a front page with 
                         heart and the whole idea of the 'Idea 
                         Man' idea can put it there!

                                     REPORTER #2
                         Chief, if we had more access --

                                     EDITOR
                         Yeah, and if a frog had wings he 
                         wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I 
                         don't want excuses, I want results!

               Whack! --

               Without even looking in its direction, the Editor has slammed 
               down the lid of the cigar box on his desk, towards which one 
               Reporter's hand had been idly reaching.

               The Reporter jerks his fingers away as the Editor spares the 
               briefest moment to glare at him.

                                     EDITOR
                         I wanna know what makes the Idea Man 
                         tick! Where is he from? Where is he 
                         going? I wanna know everything about 
                         this guy! Has he got a girl? Has he 
                         got parents?

                         All right, how many? How 'bout it, 
                         Parkinson, you've been awful quiet 
                         over there.

                                     PARKINSON
                         Uhhh...

                         Still waters run deep, chief.

                                     EDITOR
                         The only thing that runs deep with 
                         Parkinson is the holes in his ears.
                         Yes, the Idea Man! What're his hopes 
                         and dreams, his desires and 
                         aspirations? Does he think all the 
                         time or does he set aside a certain 
                         portion of the day? How tall is he 
                         and what's his shoe size? Where does 
                         he sleep and what does he eat for 
                         breakfast? Does he put jam on his 
                         toast or doesn't he put jam on his 
                         toast, and if not why not and since 
                         when?

               He thrust his face into that of the Reporter.

                                     EDITOR
                         ...Well?!!

               No answer.

                                     EDITOR
                         ...Ahh, you're useless. Yes, Idea 
                         Man! Creator! Innovator! Cerebrator! 
                         Tycoon!--

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Fake.

                                     EDITOR
                         Huhh!!

               WOMAN

               Star reporter AMY ARCHER -- attractive, smartly-dressed.

                                     AMY
                         I tell ya the guy's a phony.

                                     EDITOR
                         Phony, huh?

                                     AMY
                         As a three-dollar bill.

                                     EDITOR
                         Sez who?

                                     AMY
                         Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an 
                         Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says 
                         he is? What're his ideas? Why won't 
                         they let anyone interview him?...

               One Reporter is leaning into another to keep his voice low:

                                     REPORTER
                         Five bucks says she mentions her 
                         Pulitzer.

                                     OTHER REPORTER
                         Again? You're on.

                                     AMY
                              (as she picks up the 
                              morning paper)
                         ...And just take a look at the mug 
                         on this guy -- the jutting eyebrows, 
                         the simian forehead, the idiotic 
                         grin. Why he has a face only a mother 
                         could love --

               Whack! The Editor has slammed down the cigar box lid again 
               but: Amy, smiling, raises a cigar INTO FRAME having beaten 
               him.

               She tosses it to the Reporter who failed to get one.

                                     AMY
                         ...On payday! The only story here is 
                         how this guy made a monkey out of 
                         you, Al.

                                     EDITOR
                         Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still 
                         editor of this rag. Amy, I thought 
                         you were doing that piece on the 
                         F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will 
                         He Marry?

                                     AMY
                         I filed it yesterday.

                                     EDITOR
                         Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero 
                         or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums 
                         get up off your brains and get me 
                         that Idea Man story!

                                     REPORTERS
                         All right, chief... We'll do our 
                         best, chief... I'll give it a shot, 
                         chief...

                                     AMY
                              (at the door)
                         Al, he's the bunk.

               Slam!

               One of the wagering Reporters grins at the other, who is 
               taking out a five dollar bill.

               The door bursts open and Amy sticks her head in.

                                     AMY
                         I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEVATOR DOORS

               Sweeping open to reveal the leering face of Buzz, the elevator 
               gnat.

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, buddy! Where'd ya get the new 
                         duds?

               Norville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...and say, buddy! How'd old 
                         bucketbutt like his blue letter?
                         Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut? 
                         Did he die? Did he -- Well, hello, 
                         Mr. Mussburger, sir...

               Buzz is instant decorum as Mussburger enters the elevator.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...How're you this fine morning, 
                         sir?

               Norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the 
               mention of the blue letter.

                                     NORVILLE
                         That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. 
                         I never did give you that--

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (to Buzz)
                         Lobby. We haven't got all day.

                                     BUZZ
                         Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.

               As he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a 
               cigar, inspects it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Well I'm starved. I understand it'll 
                         be quite an affair this afternoon, 
                         and the executive roast tom turkey 
                         at the Bohemian Grove redefines the 
                         word superb.

               He puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there 
               with a lighter.

                                     BUZZ
                         My pleasure, sir.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry 
                         too --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure...

               The elevator doors open.

                                     BUZZ
                         It's been a pleasure serving you, 
                         Mr. Mussburger.

               Buzz turns to Norville. He is puzzled but trying to hide it:

                                     BUZZ
                         ...and it's been a pleasure serving 
                         you too, uh... buddy.

               MR. MUSSBURGER

               is already striding through the lobby; Norville has to lope 
               to catch up.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't 
                         we be a little bit concerned with 
                         the downward spiral of our stock 
                         these last few days? I mean, you're 
                         the expert, but at the Muncie College 
                         of Business Administration they told 
                         us --

               Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps 
               Norville on the shoulder.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Relax, Norville. It's only natural 
                         in a period of transition for the 
                         more nervous element to run for cover.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the 
                         expert, but --

               EXT. SIDEWALK

               Norville is still loping behind Mussburger, trying to keep 
               up with his long strides.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You don't happen to remember the 
                         plan I outlined to you the day I set 
                         fire to your off -- uh, the day I 
                         was promoted?

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         I do remember and I was impressed.
                         Anyway, that's all forgotten now. 
                         Driver!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Thank you, Sid, but the reason I 
                         mention it is, it would require such 
                         a small capital investment -- again, 
                         you're the expert here --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Damnit, where's my car!

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- But there's such an enormous 
                         potential profit-wise given the 
                         demographics -- baby boom --
                         discretionary income in the burgeoning 
                         middle class --

               A black limousine pulls up to the curb.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Finally.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- So if you think it's appropriate, 
                         I'd like to bounce the idea off a 
                         few people at lunch --

               Mussburger is getting into the back seat --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure, tell whoever you want...

               And, to Norville's surprise, slamming the door shut behind 
               him.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...And I'd like to hear more about 
                         it at some point, too.

               SCREEEECH -- the CAR pulls away. Norville is left talking to 
               himself on the empty sidewalk.

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, Sid, I thought you and I were...

                                     DOORMAN
                         Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk 
                         clear here?

                                     NORVILLE
                         But I'm the president of this -- 
                         aww, forget it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COFFEE SHOP

               A cheap coffee shop a half-flight down from the street.

               We are LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the coffee shop counter. 
               In the middle b.g., Norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup 
               of coffee.

               Behind him, THROUGH the window wells, we see the back and 
               forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk.

               In the extreme f.g. sit two steaming mugs of coffee.

               They belong to two VETERANS of the coffee shop, who, from 
               O.S., narrate the scene.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         I got gas, Bennie.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Yeah, tell me about it.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Ya get the special?

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Fah from it...

               He gives a low whistle under his breath as a woman enters 
               from the street and hesitates by the door, looking around. 
               Still attractive but looking somewhat down-at-the-heels, it 
               is Amy Archer.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         ...Enter the dame.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         There's one in every story.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Ten bucks says she's looking for a 
                         handout.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Twenty bucks says not here she don't 
                         find one.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She's looking for her mark.

               The woman's eyes settle on Norville, and she heads for the 
               empty stool next to his.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         She finds him.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She sits down.

               The woman says something to the counter waitress, who exits.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...and awduhs a light lunch.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She looks in her purse...

               She is holding her wallet upside down.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...No money.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         The mark notices.

               Beat. Norville, however, is not noticing: He is staring 
               intently at his coffee spoon, his hat pushed back on his 
               head, his other hand propping up a cheekbone; the woman's 
               presence does not seem to have registered yet.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...He's not noticing, Benny.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Maybe he's wise.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         He don't look wise.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Plan two: Here come the waterworks.

               The woman starts crying.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Yellowstone.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Old Faithful.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Hello, Niagara.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         He notices.

               As the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles 
               Norville and he finally does indeed notice.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         He's concerned.

               The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically 
               and waves his hands at the waitress.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She explains her perdicament, and...

                                     VETERAN #1 & #2 (O.S.)
                              (in unison)
                         ...entuh the light lunch.

               The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman.

               The woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at 
               him.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         She's got other problems, of course...

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         ...Her mother needs an operation...

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...adenoids.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         No, Bennie: Lumbago.

               Veteran #1's enunciation of "lumbago" falls into perfect 
               sync with the woman's moving lips.

               Norville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices 
               his watch.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                              (alarmed)
                         She's losing him, Bennie.

               Norville is rising to his feet.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Maybe he's wise.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         He don't look wise.

               As Norville turns to leave:

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         How does she pull this out?

               She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                              (disbelieving)
                         She isn't!

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                              (thrilled)
                         She is!

               And indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on 
               the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her.

               Norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She's good, Bennie.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         She's damn good, Lou.

               A WAITRESS enters extreme f.g. to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the 
               swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville. The Waitress is 
               FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING 
               gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she 
               holds.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (bored, nasal voice)
                         Can I get you boys anything else?

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond 
               her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They 
               sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps.

                                     VETERAN #1
                         Bromo.

               Beat.

                                     VETERAN #2
                         ...Bromo.

               INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just 
               finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President.

               The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow 
               approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he 
               is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, 
               cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the 
               doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against 
               the door and get the knob with his other hand.

               The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is 
               wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode.

               He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the 
               lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, 
               in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN 
               tnediserP.

               Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:

                                     AMY
                         I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. 
                         It was just that horrible little 
                         elevator boy...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Not at all. You're light as a feather.

                                     AMY
                              (pointing languorously)
                         The couch, please.

               Still wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch 
               and deposits her gently on it. He straightens up and looks 
               at her.

               NORVILLE'S POV

               She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES 
               as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs.

               We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside 
               his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as 
               if coming from a long way away.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     NORVILLE
                         Just a minute.

               He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his 
               head between his knees, still fighting for breath.

                                     AMY
                         I don't know what came over me. I 
                         suppose it was the shock of eating 
                         after so long without; the enzymes 
                         kicking in after so long, or whatever. 
                         But then you couldn't possibly know 
                         what it is to be tired and hungry...

               Speaking into his knees as he wheezes:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hungry, anyway.

                                     AMY
                         I don't want to bore you with all 
                         the sordid details of my life; it's 
                         not a happy story...

               Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her 
               head.

                                     AMY
                         ...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless -- 
                         though not for want of trying, that 
                         I'm friendless, with no one to -- 
                         thank you -- take care of me; and 
                         that had you not come along at just 
                         exactly the moment that you did --

               She screams, staring down at the couch.

               Norville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking.

               On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is 
               printed, in wet ink, right side around: NORVILLE BARNES, 
               President.

                                     AMY
                         Norville, I didn't know you were 
                         president here!

               Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion. When the 
               nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the 
               seat of his pants.

               Distracted but still modest:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, it's nothing really. Just 
                         determination and hard work...

               He unbuckles his trousers.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Of course, when I started in the 
                         mailroom last Tuesday I thought it 
                         might take more time --

               Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag.

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you 
                         asked f --

               He freezes, taking in the scene: Amy reclining on the couch; 
               Norville standing in front of her with his pants around his 
               ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in 
               his own hand.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (flustered)
                         Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on 
                         the desk.

               Leering:

                                     BUZZ
                         Happy days, buddy...

               As he turns to leave:

                                     BUZZ
                         ...and I'll tell your secretary you're 
                         not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!!

               He snaps the elastic strap under his chin.

               After the doors shut behind Buzz:

                                     AMY
                              (shuddering)
                         What a horrible little person.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --

                                     AMY
                         At any rate I arrived in town not 
                         ten days ago, full of dreams and 
                         aspirations, anxious to make my way 
                         in the world --

               Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her.

                                     AMY
                         A little naive perhaps but -- thank 
                         you -- armed with determination, a 
                         solid work ethic, and an indomitable 
                         belief in the future --

                                     NORVILLE
                         I myself --

               He crosses back to the desk.

                                     AMY
                         Only to have that belief, that 
                         unsullied optimism, dashed against 
                         the marble and mortar of the modern 
                         work place --

               Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box 
               on the desk and sticks it in his mouth.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Cigarette?

                                     AMY
                         No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, 
                         work and ye shall prosper -- these 
                         were the watch words of my education, 
                         the ethics of my tender years --

               OVER NORVILLE'S SHOULDER

               He has been pushing the box towards her. The box tilts lazily 
               forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk. We 
               hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the pitter-patter of 
               cigarettes raining onto the carpet.

               Amy's brow crinkles. Continuing:

                                     AMY
                         -- these were the values that were 
                         instilled in me while I was growing 
                         up in a little town you've probably 
                         never heard of --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Mind if I join you?

               He is pouring himself a drink.

                                     AMY
                         Be my guest. A little town you've 
                         probably --

               He tosses back his drink, gags, looks at Amy with his eyes 
               bulging.

               HIS POV

               Once again her IMAGE PULSATES. There is a ROARING SOUND and 
               an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips.

                                     NORVILLE
                         He waves his arms and talks with a 
                         thick rasp as he staggers to his 
                         feet.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Excuse me -- I -- executive 
                         washroom...

               He staggers out a side door.

               On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his 
               desk. At the top of her voice:

                                     AMY
                         Are you all right?...

               She throws open the top desk drawer. Inside two lonely lead 
               pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer.

               Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a 
               match off the desktop.

                                     AMY
                         ...Is it your lunch? The chicken a 
                         la king?

               From the washroom:

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         No, I --

               Amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an 
               appointment book. As she hurriedly flips through page after 
               blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness. One page only 
               has a notation: 11:45. Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior 
               Achievers Club.

                                     AMY
                         Is the a la king repeating on you?

               Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         ...I'm fine, I... You were saying?

               She mutters:

                                     AMY
                         Values... watchwords... uh, tender 
                         years...
                              (aloud)
                         -- A little town you've probably 
                         never heard of...

               She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to 
               disperse the smoke.

                                     AMY
                         ...Muncie, Indiana.

               She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET BEING 
               TURNED OFF: she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch 
               just as the washroom door opens.

               Norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his 
               forehead.

                                     NORVILLE
                         You're from Muncie?!

                                     AMY
                         Why yes, do you know it?

               Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and 
               loud syncopated grunting noises. Amy gapes at him.

               He starts singing, off-key:

                                     NORVILLE
                         'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie 
                         Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue 
                         You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin'
                         Once 'The Munce' is done with you!'

               Amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last, 
               obvious rhyme. Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly 
               follows sit, also pumping her fists.

               As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of 
               his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Goooooooo Eagles!

               Amy awkwardly imitates.

               Norville excitedly sits behind his desk.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...A Muncie girl! Talk about the 
                         cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy.
                         I'm gonna cancel the rest of my 
                         appointments this afternoon and get 
                         you a job here at the Hud.

                                     AMY
                         Oh, no, really, I --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Don't bother to thank me, it's the 
                         easiest thing in the world. Matter 
                         of fact, I know where a vacancy just 
                         came up.

               He hits the intercom.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Mail room.

               To Amy:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...This'll only take a moment.

                                     INTERCOM (V.O.)
                         Yeah?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville 
                         Barnes --

                                     INTERCOM (V.O.)
                         Barnes! Where the hell have you been! 
                         And where's my voucher?!

               Norville thumps at his pockets.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Well, I'm not sure where I --

                                     INTERCOM (V.O.)
                         I need that voucher! I told you a 
                         week ago it was important!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But look, I'm president of the company 
                         now and I --

                                     INTERCOM (V.O.)
                         I don't care if you're president of 
                         the company! I need that voucher! 
                         Now!

               CLICK. The intercom goes dead.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do 
                         you take shorthand? Are you familiar 
                         with the mimeograph machine?

                                     AMY
                         Of course -- I went to the Muncie, 
                         uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!

               Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!

                                     AMY
                         Well, I just don't know how to thank 
                         you, Mr. Barnes --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Please! Norville!

               As he reaches to shake:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...It's my pleasure!

               She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away and, 
               winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes 
               wings of his fingers.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Gooooooo Eagles!

               AMY

               likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings, 
               and, winking back:

                                     AMY
                         Gooooooooo Eagles!

               But we PULL BACK to reveal that the girl is now in a newspaper 
               office, demonstrating the fight sign to SMITTY, a reporter 
               wearing a fedora with a bent-back brim. Smitty howls with 
               laughter.

                                     SMITTY
                              (wheezing)
                         ...Once 'The Munce'... Holy...

               Amy sits down behind a typewriter and, as she starts typing 
               at 80 words per minute:

                                     AMY
                         And is this guy from chumpsville?!
                         I pulled the old mother routine --

                                     SMITTY
                         Adenoids?

                                     AMY
                         Lumbago.

               Behind her an ancient man wearing an inksman's visor and 
               sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface 
               over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces.

               Smitty gives a low whistle.

                                     SMITTY
                         That gag's got whiskers on it!

               The PHONE RINGS and Smitty reaches for it.

                                     AMY
                         I'm telling you, Smitty, the board 
                         of Hudsucker is up to something --

                                     SMITTY
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah.

                                     ANCIENT PUZZLER
                         Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word 
                         for an affliction of the hypothalmus?

               Without a break in her typing:

                                     AMY
                         -- And it's a cinch -- Goiter -- 
                         it's a cinch this guy isn't in on 
                         it. How much time to make the Late 
                         Final?

               Smitty holds the phone away from his ear.

                                     SMITTY
                         Chief.

               Still typing, Amy whistles and nods to her shoulder.

               Smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing.

                                     AMY
                         Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted 
                         to apologize to...

               Smitty is looking at his watch.

                                     SMITTY
                         About seven minutes.

                                     AMY
                              (still typing)
                         Yeah, I was all wet about your idea 
                         man... Well, thanks for being so 
                         generous... It is human, and you are

                         is a real moron --

               To the Ancient Puzzler:

                         -- as in a five-letter word for 
                         imbecile --

               Back into phone:

                                     AMY
                         -- as pure a specimen as I've ever 
                         run across... Am I sure he's a nitwit? 
                         Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't 
                         make me an expert then my name isn't 
                         Amy Archer and I've never won the 
                         Pulitzer Prize...

               Her eyes narrow.

                         Amy, what's a three-letter word for 
                         a flightless bird?

                                     AMY
                         Not now, Morris, I'm busy -- That's 
                         right, I said hammerhead, as in a 
                         ten-letter word for a smug bullying 
                         self-important newspaperman --

               To Morris:

                         -- Gnu --

               Into phone:

                                     AMY
                         -- who couldn't find --

               To Morris:

               Into phone:

                         -- couldn't find the Empire State

               To Morris:

                                     AMY
                         -- or emu.

               She slams down the phone. To Smitty:

                                     AMY
                         ...And that's just the potatoes, 
                         Smitty, here comes the gravy: The 
                         chump really likes me. A Muncie girl!

               Smitty bursts out laughing.

                                     SMITTY
                         Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

               As she continues to type:

                                     AMY
                         I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the 
                         patsy and I'm gonna find out what 
                         for. There's a real story, Smitty, 
                         some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, 
                         a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!

                                     SMITTY
                         He didn't offer you money.

                                     AMY
                         A sawbuck!

                                     SMITTY
                         Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!

                                     AMY
                         On Norville Barnes!

               She rips the page out of the typewriter, swivels in her chair 
               to FACE CAMERA as we TRACK IN CLOSE and she hollers:

                                     AMY
                         ...Copy!

                                                       DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

               PRESSES

               rolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint.

               Papers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very 
               quickly.

               DELIVERY MAN

               throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck.

               BALED PAPER

               rolling into the f.g. A hand ENTERS FRAME to snip its wires 
               and wipe off the top paper.

               PAPER BOY

               wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap, mouthing "Extra! 
               Extra!" as he holds one of the papers aloft.

               PAN UP his arm TO the newspaper and, BEYOND it, the towering 
               Hudsucker Building.

               All of the above --

                                                           DISSOLVING WITH:

               NEWSPAPER

               spinning TOWARDS the CAMERA and STOPPING FULL FRAME.

               Its headline, over a picture of Norville smiling, is "IMBECILE 
               HEADS HUDSUCKER." The subheadline: "Not a Brain in his Head."

               ANOTHER ANGLE - NEWSPAPER

               is angrily slammed down to reveal that Norville has been 
               reading the inside.

               His face twisting with fury, he leans forward and hits the 
               intercom.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Miss Smith, can you come in please 
                         to take a letter...

               Muttering to himself:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...of all the cockamamie...

               Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil.

               As she seats herself in front of his desk, he rises to pace 
               behind it.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Did you happen to see the front 
                         page of today's Manhattan Argus?

                                     AMY
                         Well, I... didn't bother to read the 
                         article. I didn't think the picture 
                         did you justice.

                                     NORVILLE
                         The picture was fine! It's what that 
                         knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! 
                         Of all the irresponsible... Amy, 
                         take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I 
                         call you 'Miss' because you seem to 
                         have 'missed' the boat completely on 
                         this one! How on earth would you 
                         know whether I'm an imbecile when 
                         you don't even have the guts to come 
                         in here and interview me man to man! 
                         No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, 
                         make it 'common decency.' These wild 
                         speculations about my intelligence --

                                     AMY
                         -- or lack thereof?

                                     NORVILLE
                              (nodding)
                         -- these preposterous inventions, 
                         would be better suited to the pages 
                         of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the 
                         editors of the Manhattan Argus see 
                         fit to publish the rantings of a 
                         disordered mind, perhaps they will 
                         see fit to publish this letter! But 
                         I doubt it. I most seriously doubt 
                         it. As I doubt also that you could 
                         find a home at Amazing Tales, a 
                         periodical which I have enjoyed for 
                         many years. Yours sincerely, et 
                         cetera.

               He drifts into thought.

                                     AMY
                         Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least 
                         better than that that dame does. Do 
                         you think I'm an imbecile?

                                     AMY
                         I'm sure I --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Go on, tell the truth; I trust you 
                         and I put a lot of stock in your 
                         opinion.

                                     AMY
                         Well, I --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a 
                         fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile 
                         come up with this?

               He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an 
               easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle 
               rendered onto it.

               Amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly 
               beaming face.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...I designed it myself and this is 
                         just the sweet baby that can put 
                         Hudsucker right back on top.

               Amy is bewildered. Norville explains:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You know! For kids!

                                     AMY
                         ...Why don't I just type this up...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be 
                         necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's 
                         just doing her job, I guess.

                                     AMY
                         Well, I don't know; maybe she does 
                         deserve it. Maybe she should've come 
                         in to face you man to man.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, she probably had a deadline...

                                     AMY
                         Sure, but -- she could still have 
                         gotten your side for the record!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, it's done now -- what's the 
                         use of grousing about it. Forget the 
                         letter, Amy, I just had to blow off 
                         some steam...

               She gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when 
               Norville adds:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...She's probably just a little 
                         confused.

               Amy turns at the door.

                                     AMY
                         Confused?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yeah, you know, probably one of these 
                         fast-talking career gals, thinks 
                         she's one of the boys. Probably is 
                         one of the boys, if you know what I 
                         mean.

                                     AMY
                              (through clenched 
                              teeth)
                         I'm quite sure I don't know what you 
                         mean.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of 
                         these complexes they have nowadays. 
                         Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? 
                         She's probably very unattractive and 
                         bitter about it.

                                     AMY
                         Oh, is that it!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in 
                         men's clothing, swaps drinks with 
                         the guys at the local watering hole, 
                         and hobnobs with some smooth talking 
                         heel in the newsroom named Biff or 
                         Smoocher or...

                                     AMY
                         Smitty.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Exactly. And I bet she's ugly.
                         Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't 
                         they print her picture next to her 
                         byline?

                                     AMY
                         Maybe she puts her work ahead of her 
                         personal appearance.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I bet that's exactly what she tells 
                         herself! But you and I both know 
                         she's just a dried-up bitter old 
                         maid. Say, how about you and I grab 
                         a little dinner and a show after 
                         work? I was thinking maybe The King 
                         and I --

               Whap! Amy slaps him.

               He stares.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...How about Oklahoma?

               As she stalks out of the office:

                                     AMY
                         Norville Barnes, you don't know a 
                         thing about that woman! You don't 
                         know who she really is! And only a 
                         numbskull thinks he knows things 
                         about things he knows nothing about!

               He stares, rubbing his cheek.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Say, what gives?

               WHISTLE

               SHRIEKING.

                                                              SWISH PAN TO:

               CLOCK

               Reading five o'clock.

                                                              SWISH PAN TO:

               WORKERS

               Rising from their desks, collecting personal effects, putting 
               on their hats and coats.

               TIME CLOCK

               Busy hands punch out.

               INT. EMPTY HALLWAY

               Of the executive floor. A security man walks down the hall, 
               whistling, swinging a ring of keys. After he passes the door 
               to the ladies' room it opens, Amy peeks out, emerges, goes 
               into Norville's office.

               INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               She goes to the desk, takes out the appointment book, flips 
               through it.

               BOOK

               Still empty except for the one date with the Wilkie Grammer 
               School Junior Achievers Club, which now has a red line drawn 
               across it with the notation CANCELED.

               AMY

               looks around the office -- notices something.

               DOOR

               Set into the wall to one side it is topped by a small plaque: 
               AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

               Amy tries the knob, which turns, and enters.

               INT. ROOM

               It is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral 
               staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the 
               gloom above. It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs, 
               gears. There is no window, but on what would be the window 
               wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping 
               an interior circle. It is the backside of the great Hudsucker 
               clock.

               Amy gazes about. She crosses to a door opposite the one she 
               entered from.

               She stoops to peek through its keyhole.

               HER POV

               We are LOOKING INTO Sidney J. Mussburger's office.

               Mussburger sits at his desk barking into a Dictaphone.

               CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS on his desk 
               are going full-tilt; THRUMMMMMMM -- the CLOCK'S exterior 
               second hand sweeps a shadow across the office.

               Mussburger, it seems, never sleeps.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Watchoo doin' down they, Miss Archuh?

                                     AMY
                         Huh?!

               She straightens and turns.

               Facing her is a very old BLACK MAN in a janitor's jumpsuit 
               with HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES/The Future Is Now emblazoned across 
               it. We might recognize his voice as that of the narrator who 
               opened the movie.

                                     AMY
                         Who are you? How did you know who I 
                         am?

                                     MOSES (BLACK MAN)
                         Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about 
                         ever'thing, leastways if it concerns 
                         Hudsuckuh.

                                     AMY
                         But -- who are you -- what d'you do 
                         here?

                                     MOSES
                         Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- 
                         this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. 
                         Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- 
                         it drives that ol' global economy 
                         and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' 
                         on 'roun'. Ya see, without that 
                         capital fo'mation --

                                     AMY
                         Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone 
                         about me, will you?

                                     MOSES
                         I don't tell no one nothin' lessen 
                         they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' 
                         way.

                                     AMY
                         So if you know everything about 
                         Hudsucker, tell me why the Board 
                         decided to make Norville Barnes 
                         president.

                                     MOSES
                         Well, that even surprised ole Moses 
                         at fust. I didn't think the Board 
                         was that smart.

                                     AMY
                         That smart?!

                                     MOSES
                         But then I figured it out: they did 
                         it 'cause they figured young Norville 
                         for an imbecile. Like some othuh 
                         people ah know.

                                     AMY
                         Why on earth would they want a nitwit 
                         to be president?

                                     MOSES
                         'Cause they's little pigglies!
                         They's tryin' to inspire panic, make 
                         that stock git cheap so's they can 
                         snitch it all up fo' themselves! But 
                         Norville, he's got some tricks up 
                         his sleeve, he does...

               He draws a circle with his finger in the air.

                                     MOSES
                         ...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a 
                         smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, 
                         he's a caution. Wal, some folks is 
                         square, an' some is hip --

               To punctuate, he gives a little jerk of his hips.

                                     MOSES
                         ...But I guess you don't really know 
                         him any better than that board does, 
                         do ya, Miss Archuh?

                                     AMY
                         Well, maybe I --

                                     MOSES
                         An' only some kind a knucklehead 
                         thinks she knows things 'bout things 
                         she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- 
                         How'd that go?

                                     AMY
                              (bristling)
                         It's hardly the same --

                                     MOSES
                         Why you don't even know y'own self -- 
                         you ain't exactly the genuine article 
                         are you, Miss Archuh?

                                     AMY
                         Well, in connection with my job, 
                         sometimes I have to go undercover as 
                         it were --

                                     MOSES
                         I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' 
                         to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't

               Elsewhere in the great room, he is hunkered down next to a 
               catchment which he buffs with a greasy rag. Amy's VOICE ECHOES 
               UP:

                                     AMY (O.S.)

                         Them po' young folks. Looks like 
                         Norville's in fo' the same kind o' 
                         heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, 
                         she never axed me 'bout dat...

               INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE

               He slams down a typescript.

                                     CHIEF
                         I can't print this!

                         Why not, it's all true! The board is 
                         using this poor guy! They're 
                         depressing the stock so they can buy 
                         it cheap!

                                     CHIEF
                         It's pure speculation! Why, they'd 
                         have my butt in a satchel!

                         I know they're gonna buy that stock --

                         You don't know anything! Fact is 
                         they haven't bought it! The stock is 
                         cheap, Archer! What're they waiting 
                         for?

                                     AMY

                         Amy's hunches are usually pretty 
                         good, Chief.

                                     CHIEF
                         You don't accuse someone of stock 
                         manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz!
                         The readers of the Manhattan Argus 
                         aren't interested in sensationalism, 
                         gossip and unsupported speculation. 
                         Facts, figures -- those are the tools 
                         of the newspaper trade! Why it's 
                         almost as if you're trying to take 
                         the heat off this Barnes numbskull -- 
                         like you've gone all soft on him!

                         Come on, Chief, that's a low blow.
                         Archer's not gonna go goey for a 
                         corn-fed idiot.

                                     CHIEF
                         All right, I was out of line. But 
                         you're out of line with this stock 
                         swindle story. Gimme some more of 
                         that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff --

                         It's about a dimwitted editor who --

                         Easy, Amy...

               He gives her a companionable goose.

                                     SMITTY
                         ...Let's grab a highball and calm 
                         down.

               She whirls and slaps him.

                         Back off -- smoocher!

               Smitty rubs his cheek, staring as she storms off.

                         Say, what gives?

               ENGRAVED INVITATION

               IT READS:

               Sidney J. Mussburger President Norville Barnes and The Board 
               of Hudsucker Industries CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO The Annual 
               Fancy-Dress Hudsucker Christmas Gala Music, Dancing, 
               Refreshments (Dainties) Formal Evening Attire de Rigeuer. 

               The MUSIC OVER the invitation -- "WE WISH YOU A MERRY 
               CHRISTMAS" -- SEGUES INTO the dance music of the Hudsucker 
               Chamber Orchestra.

               DANCING COUPLES

               FILL the SCREEN; we GLIDE AMONG them and FINALLY COME to 
               follow one couple: Norville and MRS. MUSSBURGER, a large 
               middle-aged woman of the Margaret Dumont-mold in an 
               elaborately flowered and old-fashioned evening gown, low-cut 
               in spite of her overly-heavy figure. She wears a large 
               flowered hat with a rolled-up veil.

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         -- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons 
                         and the garden was in positive ruins!

                                     NORVILLE
                         That must have been quite a 
                         disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I 
                         was in bed for a week! Positively 
                         sick with fury! I called in the 
                         gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, 
                         either those azaleas come up next 
                         spring or you are terminee!

               She throws her head back and roars with laughter.

               ANGLE - THEIR FEET

               As the large woman leans back to laugh, her feet stay planted 
               on the ground and Norville's rise to be dragged with his 
               toes scraping the floor through the continuing dance.

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         I'm brushing up on my French with 
                         the most charming man, Pierre of 
                         Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I haven't had --

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         Sidney and I are planning a trip to 
                         Paris and points continental --
                         Aren't we, dear?

               Mussburger has ENTERED FRAME.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure. I'm going to borrow 
                         Norville for a while, if you don't 
                         mind, dear.

               MIXING DOWN as they leave her:

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         Well, frankly, I...

                                     NORVILLE
                         You have a charming wife, Mr.
                         Muss -- uh, Sid.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         So they tell me. Norville, let me 
                         shepherd you through some of the 
                         introductions here. Try not to talk 
                         too much; some of our biggest 
                         stockholders are, uh -- scratch that: 
                         Say whatever you want.

               ENTRYWAY

               As Amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown. She 
               looks around the room, then starts across the crowded floor 
               towards the punch bowl.

               NORVILLE

               As Mussburger introduces him to a tall, imposing BUSINESSMAN 
               in a tuxedo and a ten-gallon hat.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce 
                         Mr. Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker 
                         Industries largest and most loyal 
                         stockholders.

               Ignoring Norville's proffered hand:

                                     CARDOZO (BUSINESSMAN)
                         Dammit boy, what's this I hear about 
                         you bein' an embecile? What the hell 
                         is ailin' ya?! A week ago my stock 
                         was worth twice what it is now! I'm 
                         considering dumping the whole shootin' 
                         match, unless I see some vast 
                         improvement! Dammit, boy, It's a 
                         range war! Either you pull our wagons 
                         into a circle or I'm pullin' out of 
                         the wagon train!

               Norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No need for concern, sir; it's only 
                         natural in a period of transition 
                         for the more timid element to run 
                         for cover --

                                     CARDOZO
                         So I'm yella, am I?!!

               He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket:

                                     CARDOZO
                         ...We'll see who's yella!!

               His WIFE, a small wiry woman, steps in as Mussburger starts 
               dragging Norville away.

                                     MRS. CARDOZO
                         Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein' 
                         sech an ole grizzly.

               As he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket:

                                     CARDOZO
                         Aww, I wasn't gonna hurt the boy, 
                         Lorelei...

               MUSSBURGER AND NORVILLE

               As they make their way through the room Norville is mopping 
               at his brow with a handkerchief.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I 
                         showed him the long view we might --

               Thump! Dabbing at his brow, Norville has walked square into 
               the back of a debonaire man holding a martini.

               The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Norville, this is Thorstensen 
                         Finlandsen, who heads a radical 
                         splinter group of disgruntled 
                         investors.

               Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen's hand.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to 
                         meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y -- 
                         uh, pleased to make your --

               Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at Norville's 
               handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently having 
               been given it during the handshake.

               He hands it back to Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Thank you, sir...

               He stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as 
               Findlandsen stares at him. Mussburger stands watching in the 
               executive at-ease, hands dug into his pockets.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...I understand your concern about 
                         the down-ward, you know, but I think 
                         you'll find under our strong new 
                         leadership...

               As Norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the 
               handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of the 
               pocket and follows his hand down.

               Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look, and 
               stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky.

               Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at 
               Norville, who continues, O.S.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         We anticipate, in short order, an 
                         upward...

               In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch -- 
               Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand 
               pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand 
               pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly 
               waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward 
               onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN.

                                     MRS. FINDLANDSEN
                         Ahhh!

               There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim:

               EMCEE

               grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the 
               band and grins.

                                     EMCEE
                         Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished 
                         members of the Hudsucker board. I 
                         give you the king of swing, the rajah 
                         of romance, the incredible, the 
                         unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta!

               Vic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs 
               away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon. He wears a white 
               dinner jacket. His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead 
               in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and 
               bounces across his forehead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SEVERAL BOARD MEMBERS

               Clustered in a dim corner of the room, smoking cigars.

               In the b.g., brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his 
               song.

               As Mussburger joins them:

                                     EXECUTIVE #1
                         How's it going, Mr. Mussburger?

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Bad.

                                     EXECUTIVE #2
                         Good.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         But not bad enough.

                                     EXECUTIVE #3
                         Too bad.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         It could be better, it could be worse.

                                     ALL THREE EXECUTIVES
                         Hmmmmmm.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         The stock's got to drop another five 
                         points if we expect to get controlling 
                         interest. Norville tells me he's got 
                         some hot idea. Can't be good.

                                     EXECUTIVE #1
                         Then it can't be bad!

                                     EXECUTIVE #2
                         Couldn't be better if it couldn't be 
                         worse.

                                     ALL
                         Hmmmmmm.

               EXT. PENTHOUSE - TERRACE

               where the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just 
               FILTERING OUT.

               We are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing 
               the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture, 
               with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand 
               pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a 
               stiff neck tossing back a drink.

               REVERSE

               Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him.

                                     AMY
                         ...Norville?

               He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a 
               dripping icepack against one eye.

                                     AMY
                         ...What happened?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh. Nothing, really, just... the 
                         more timid investors are no longer 
                         running for cover.

                                     AMY
                         Let me look.

               He does.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sid found me the icepack.

                                     AMY
                         Let me hold it, or you'll have a 
                         real shiner.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot 
                         over this imbecile story.

                                     AMY
                         ...I'm sorry.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy.
                         You're the one person who's been 
                         standing by me through all this.

               As she rolls the pack gently across his eye:

                                     AMY
                         Norville... there's something I have 
                         to tell you. You see, I'm not really 
                         a secretary.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I know that, Amy.

                                     AMY
                         ...You do?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I understand that you're not very 
                         skilled yet in the secretarial arts. 
                         I'm not that skilled as president. 
                         Oh sure, I put up a big front --
                              (massages his eye)
                         -- not that everyone's buying it.

                                     AMY
                         I believe in you, Norville --
                         At least I believe in your... 
                         intentions --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, I don't blame them, really. I 
                         guess I have sort of made a mess of 
                         things. These folks have to protect 
                         their investment. Most of them are 
                         very nice people --

                                     AMY
                         Norville, you can't trust people 
                         here like you did in Muncie...

               They gaze out at the city.

                                     AMY
                         ...Certain people are --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Didja ever go to the top of old man 
                         Larson's feed tower and look out 
                         over the town?

                                     AMY
                         ...Huh?

                                     NORVILLE
                         You know, on farm route 17.

                                     AMY
                         Oh yes! In Muncie!

                                     NORVILLE
                         No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!

                                     AMY
                         Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well 
                         no, I -- I never really... There's a 
                         place I go now, the cutest little 
                         place near my apartment in Greenwich 
                         Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's 
                         a beatnik bar.

                                     NORVILLE
                         You don't say.

                                     AMY
                         Yes, you can get carrot juice or 
                         Italian coffee, and the people there -- 
                         well, none of them quite fit in. 
                         You'd love it -- why don't you come 
                         there with me -- they're having a 
                         marathon poetry reading on New Year's 
                         Eve. I go every year.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (puzzled)
                         Every year?

                                     AMY
                         Well -- this year -- if it's good I 
                         plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my 
                         it certainly is beautiful --

               She nods out at the city to avoid Norville's quizzical look.

                                     AMY
                         ...The people look like ants.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, the Hindus say -- and the 
                         beatniks also -- that in the next 
                         life some of us will come back as 
                         ants. Some will be butterflies.
                         Others will be elephants or creatures 
                         of the sea.

                                     AMY
                         What a beautiful thought.

                                     NORVILLE
                         What do you think you were in your 
                         previous life, Amy?

                                     AMY
                         Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a 
                         fast-talking career gal who thought 
                         she was one of the boys --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so 
                         but I find that very farfetched.

                                     AMY
                         Norville, there really is something 
                         I have to tell you --

                                     NORVILLE
                         That kind of person would come back 
                         as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I 
                         think it more likely that you were a 
                         gazelle, with long, graceful legs, 
                         gamboling through the underbrush. 
                         Perhaps we met once, a chance 
                         encounter in a forest glade. I must 
                         have been an antelope or an ibex. 
                         What times we must have had -- 
                         foraging together for sustenance, 
                         picking the grubs and burrs from one 
                         another's coats. Or perhaps we simply 
                         touched our horns briefly and went 
                         our separate ways...

                                     AMY
                         I wish it were that simple, Norville. 
                         I wish I was still a gazelle, and 
                         you were an antelope or an ibex.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, can I at least call you deer? 
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the 
                         whole thing is what your beatnik 
                         friends call 'karma' -- the great 
                         circle of life, death and rebirth.

               Morosely:

                                     AMY
                         Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
                         What goes around comes around.

                                     NORVILLE
                         That's it. A great wheel that gives 
                         us each what we deserve...

               He slaps his fist into his palm.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Tomorrow's my big presentation to 
                         the board. I've gotta show Sidney 
                         and the guys that I deserve all their 
                         confidence!

               Sadly:

                                     AMY
                         Oh, Norville --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for

                         Sure, Norville, sure...

               She gives him a peck. They look at each other.

                                     AMY
                         ...Oh, Norville!

               She embraces him. They kiss again.

               Norville's eyes widen.

               VIC TENETTA

               Crooning the end of his song.

               Turn to the bandstand and applaud.

               NORVILLE AND AMY

               In the midst of a passionate kiss.

               FADE IN:

               DOUBLE OAK DOORS

               Labeled "Executive Conference Room." A secretary is hanging 
               up a sign that reads: "Quiet Please! Board Meeting in 
               Session."

               INT. BOARDROOM - CLOSE ON NORVILLE

               Chest and up. His upper torso is swaying, his shoulders 
               rhythmically rolling as he talks. We hear a WHOOSH WHOOSH 
               sound from O.S.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- So we have economy, simplicity, 
                         low production cost and the potential 
                         for mass appeal, and all that spells 
                         out great profitability...

               CLOSE ON MUSSBURGER

               Staring. Holding a just-lighted but forgotten cigar in one 
               hand, and a still burning match in the other.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         ...I had the boys down at R & D throw 
                         together this prototype so that our 
                         discussion here could have some 
                         focus...

               BOARD

               Staring, mouths hanging open, in arrested motion much like 
               when Waring Hudsucker jumped out the window at the previous 
               board meeting.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         ...and to give you gentlemen of the 
                         Board a first-hand look at just how 
                         exciting this gizmo is...

               WIDER ON NORVILLE

               Still gyrating. We now see that he has accelerated the hula 
               hoop around his waist to quite a good speed.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...It's fun, it's healthy, it's good 
                         exercise; kids'll just love it, and 
                         we put a little sand inside to make 
                         the whole experience more pleasant. 
                         And the great part is we won't have 
                         to charge an arm and a leg!

               Mussburger's forgotten match has burned down to his 
               fingertips. With a wince, he shakes it out.

               The Board is staring.

               The Board looks at Mussburger.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...It's genius. It's just exactly 
                         what Hudsucker needs at this juncture.

               He smiles weakly at Norville.

               As furiously BUSY MUSIC STARTS:

               TELETYPE

               Furiously PRINTING out "EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE #37451-JL7.

               A hand ENTERS FRAME and rips the directive from the teletype, 
               then hurriedly rolls it into a cylinder and slips it into a 
               cylindrical metal capsule.

               The capsule is popped into a pneumatic tube.

               ANGLE - LENGTH OF PNEUMATIC PIPING

               somewhere in the labyrinthine substructure of the Hudsucker 
               Building. We hear a MISSILE furiously HURTLING towards us, 
               inside the pipe, and ROCKETING by.

               Once again we hear the CAPSULE APPROACH and ROCKET past.

               BLINDING RED LIGHTS

               as a SIREN BLARES. On a huge board that says HUDSUCKER DESIGN 
               DEPARTMENT, flashing red letters announce: INCOMING DIRECTIVE!

               The pneumatic tube spout shoots out a cylinder, and a hand 
               eagerly picks it up and yanks it OUT OF FRAME.

               A technician in white laboratory smock is reading the 
               directive as several other white-jacketed technicians crowd 
               their heads around his shoulders, also reading.

               All of their eye and head motions synchronize as they eagerly 
               read, devouring the document line by line.

               A large sheet of graph paper is whipped down on top of a 
               drafting table. Under the caption OVERHEAD ANGLE is a perfect 
               circle. Under the caption HORIZONTAL is a horizontal line. 
               Under the caption VERTICAL SIDE ANGLE is a vertical line.

               looking thoughtfully down at the rendering. The head 
               technician is stroking his beard and nodding.

               we can see the three admen working inside.

               Two pace back and forth, smoking cigarettes, as they toss 
               out ideas. The third sits slumped in front of a silhouette 
               typewriter, his head resting on one hand, his other hand 
               resting on a half-empty bottle of whiskey.

               In the f.g., outside the frosted glass and so not in 
               silhouette, sits a bored secretary reading War and Peace, 
               Volume One.

               hula hoop. Over the poster is an enormous banner: "WHAT WILL

               PAN FROM the poster TO a HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a floor full of 
               accountants sitting at their rows and rows of desks; all are 
               looking up at the wall poster as they operate their manual 
               adding machines to the same beat.

               All accountants wear identical vests, shirtsleeves, garters, 
               visors and spectacles.

               The head accountant stands in front of the room overseeing 
               their efforts. He wears a full three-piece suit, a visor and 
               a pince-nez.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Being dropped onto a desk. Its cover reads: SUMMARY OF COST 
               ANALYSIS.

               The book is opened and its pages, filled with rows of numbers, 
               are flipped to the last page where we QUICKLY PAN DOWN TO 
               the bottom line: Unit Cost... $0.59 Suggested Retail... $0.79

               Looking down at the book as the head accountant hovers over 
               his shoulder, waiting for his reaction.

               The executive grimly shakes his head.

               EXPLOSION harshly illuminates the sandbags. As the EXPLOSION 
               SUBSIDES:

               The workmen cautiously peek out over the sandbags, then flip 
               back their visors and rise to their feet.

               Bouncing among the flaming debris of the explosion is a hula 
               hoop, still intact.

               An artist's hand working in fast motion to render the hula 
               hoop logo: A grinning, healthy 1950s boy with a spray of 
               freckles, one fist thrown forward, the other behind, as if 
               doing an athletic frug, a hula hoop spinning with action 
               lines around his waist.

               In seconds the artist has completed the logo and now, also 
               in fast motion, he writes the slogan on either side of the 
               boy: "You know... For Kids!"

               IRON GRILL

               is thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just 
               opening for the day.

               In the window is an enormous hula hoop display, with various 
               hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama -- 
               "You know... for Kids!"

               Reflected in the display window we see crowds of people 
               scurrying by, indifferent to the display. Inside the shop we 
               see the proprietor by the cash register, his chin propped 
               glumly in his hands.

               Norville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of Amy who sits 
               hunched over the ticker-tape machine, studying the emerging 
               tape. Amy finally looks up at Norville and sadly shakes her 
               head.

               BACK TO SHOP WINDOW

               Crowds still scurry indifferently by. The shopkeeper stands 
               idly in his doorway, smoking a cigarette.

               We TRACK IN ON the cardboard display. The displayed price of 
               $1.79 has been crossed out. Underneath it, inked in: "Reduced:

               Norville is nervously pacing. Amy still studies the ticker-
               tape. Once again she is forced to shake her head sadly.

               BACK TO SHOP'S PRICE DISPLAY

               ALLEY BEHIND SHOP

               where garbage and garbage cans sit waiting for collection:

               Hands appear at the back door of a shop hurling a clutch of 
               hoops towards the trash heap. One errant hoop rolls towards 
               the mouth of the alley.

               The mouth of the alley. The escaped hula hoop emerges and 
               starts rolling down the street.

               HULA HOOP

               It rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid 
               it.

               It rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a 
               circle around him, and finally wobbles to the pavement.

               The little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to 
               his hips and starts hula hooping. Somewhere a BELL is RINGING.

               INT. NEARBY SCHOOLHOUSE

               where the BELL is RINGING, the front doors fly open and 
               hundreds of schoolchildren run out, screaming, heading home,

               The screaming pack of schoolchildren round a corner and -- 
               stop short, their screams abruptly halting.

               They are staring, fascinated, at the hula-hooping youngster.

               The children are dumbfounded. It is a moment the likes of 
               which they have never dreamed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Norville sits slumped behind his desk, his head resting on 
               the desktop, utterly dejected.

               Suddenly the TICKER-TAPE HUMS to life and starts spitting 
               tape. Amy looks at it with mounting excitement. Finally she 
               looks breathlessly up:

               TO SWELL.

               The mean laugh. Norville, behind his desk in LONG SHOT, 
               laughing, as we begin to TRACK IN. There is something 
               disconcerting about his laugh -- it is harder, more 
               businesslike, colder than the dopey laugh that accompanied 
               his elevation to the presidency. Or perhaps it is only our 
               imagination, for while still some distance away from him:

                         Mr. Barnes, did the board consider 
                         you an 'idea man' when they promoted 
                         you from the mail room?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I guess so -- I don't think 
                         they promoted me because they thought 
                         I was a jerk.

                         'hoopla'!

               This TIRED old joke brings some polite laughter.

               Norville is smiling as he enters the elevator. As its doors

                         more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm 
                         earning my keep.

               waist, is receiving a choppity-chop massage on a padded table 
               from a muscular man in a bulging T-shirt.

                         Pull yourself together, Addison.

               Addison snuffles.

                         Nobody told me! Nobody told me!
                         You sold all of our stock?

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         We dumped the whole load. Now quit 
                         showboating, Addison --

                         I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. 
                         There's no point in looking back. At 
                         the time, Stilson thought dumping 
                         our position would panic the market, 
                         further depress the stock -- then 
                         we'd buy it all back, and more of 
                         course, once it got cheap --

                                     ADDISON
                         Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more 
                         valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!

               He climbs up onto the board table.

                                     ADDISON
                         I'm getting off this merry-go-round!

                         Aaaaahhh!

               He runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward 
               the window and:

               Thwok!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE - ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE

               LOOKING IN, as Addison flattens against the f.g. glass, his 
               face squushing, his outflung hands likewise.

               All stare in horror for a long silent beat.

               With the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass, 
               Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor, 
               and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree.

               Mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth.

                         All right, so the kid caught a wave. 
                         So right now he and his dingus are 
                         on top. Well, this too shall pass. 
                         Myrtle J. Mussburger didn't raise 
                         her boy to go knockkneed at the first 
                         sign of adversity. I say, we made 
                         this kid and we can break him. I 
                         say, the higher he climbs, the harder 
                         he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a 
                         future, and in it I see shame, 
                         dishonor, ignominy and disgrace.

               Sure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin 
               ain't over yet.

               NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               A small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing 
               "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in 
               his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of 
               him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his 
               temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs.

               A French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee 
               squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a 
               stone chisel and hammer.

               A GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, 
               reading the funny papers.

               At length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, 
               batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hold it!...

               The musicians' playing dribbles away to silence.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Nobody move, nobody breathe...

               All sit frozen. You could hear a pin drop.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...An idea... is coming...

               Eyes narrowed, he gazes off into space, squinting for his 
               idea.

               CLOSE ON TAILOR'S KIT

               A straight pin is rolling across the top -- it drops off --

               EXTREME CLOSE ON FLOOR

               Where the PIN -- PING! -- hits.

                         Deflates. He glares at the tailor.

                                     NORVILLE
                         It's gone now.

               The musicians resume playing. Everyone else resumes work. 
               The INTERCOM BUZZES and a female voice announces:

                                     FEMALE (V.O.)
                         Miss Amy here to see you.

               Norville leans forward to hit his intercom.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Is she in the book? --

               The door bursts open and Amy storms in.

                                     AMY
                         For Pete's sake, Norville!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought 
                         she said, Mamie --

                                     AMY
                         Never mind about that...

               She shakes a piece of paper at Norville.

                                     AMY
                         ...You know what those nincompoops 
                         in the boardroom are doing?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --

                                     AMY
                         They're going to discharge eight 
                         percent of the work force here at 
                         Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone 
                         that means eighteen hundred people 
                         out of work, people with wives and 
                         children and families --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well yes, we're pruning away some of 
                         the dead wood, but if --

                                     AMY
                         You mean you know about this?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Know about it? You think the Board 
                         would do anything like this without 
                         my authorization? No, this was my 
                         idea from the start.

                                     AMY
                         Your i --

                                     NORVILLE
                         We have to be realistic, Amy. You 
                         know things have slowed down a little 
                         here at Hudsucker --

                                     AMY
                         You're awful kind to yourself, 
                         Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've 
                         slowed down, sitting up here like a 
                         sultan, not doing a lick of work! 
                         Why you know it's ideas that are the 
                         lifeblood of industry and you haven't 
                         come up with one since the hoop and 
                         the reason's plain to see! You've 
                         forgotten what made your ideas 
                         exciting for you in the first place -- 
                         it wasn't for the fame and the wealth 
                         and the mindless adulation of -- 
                         would you get out of here?!

               This was addressed to the chamber orchestra, whose playing 
               dribbles off. They look inquisitively at Norville, then rise 
               to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office.

                                     AMY
                         ...I've been watching you, Norville 
                         Barnes, even though you've been trying 
                         to avoid me --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Aim --

                                     AMY
                         Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't 
                         noticed how you've changed. I used 
                         to think you were a swell guy -- 
                         well, to be honest I thought you 
                         were an imbecile --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Aim --

                                     AMY
                         Shutup! -- but then I figured out 
                         you were a swell guy, a little slow 
                         maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe 
                         you're not so slow, but you're not 
                         so swell either and it looks like 
                         you're an imbecile after --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Aim --

                                     AMY
                         Shutup! -- after all! You haven't 
                         talked to me for a week and now I'm 
                         going to say my piece. I've got a 
                         prediction for you, Norville Barnes: 
                         I predict that since you've decided 
                         to dedicate yourself to greed and 
                         sloth and everything bad, you're 
                         going to lose all the good things 
                         that your good ideas brought you.
                         You're going to throw them all away 
                         chasing after money and ease and the 
                         respect of a Board that wouldn't 
                         give you the time of day if you... 
                         if you...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Worked in a watch factory?

               The Goon looks up from his funnies.

                                     GOON
                         Huh-huh-huh!

                                     AMY
                              (to the Goon)
                         Shutup!
                              (to Norville)
                         Exactly! Don't you remember how you 
                         used to feel about the hoop? You 
                         told me you were gonna bring a smile 
                         to the hips of everyone in America, 
                         regardless of race, creed or color. 
                         Finally there'd be a thingamajig 
                         that would bring everyone together -- 
                         even if it kept 'em apart, spacially -- 
                         you know, for kids? Your words, 
                         Norville, not mine. I used to love 
                         Norville Barnes -- yes, love him! -- 
                         when he was just a swell kid with 
                         hot ideas who was in over his head, 
                         but now your head is too big to be 
                         in over!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Amy --

                                     AMY
                         Consider this my resignation --

               Thwock -- She slaps him.

               The bodyguard is on his feet.

                                     GOON
                         Hey!!

               Crack -- Amy kicks him hard in the shin.

                                     GOON
                         ...Awooooo!

                                     AMY
                         -- Effective immediately!!

               She strides to the door, leaving Norville rubbing his cheek 
               and the Goon hopping around on one leg.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               CLOSE SHOT - PICTURE OF AMY

               PULL BACK SHOWS it to be her identification in her Hudsucker 
               personnel file.

               A hand brings INTO FRAME another picture of her -- this one 
               a newspaper clipping. She stands on a podium accepting an 
               award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets. 
               The caption says, "Amy Archer of the Manhattan Argus Receives 
               Pulitzer Prize."

               WIDER ANGLE

               We are in Mussburger's office. Mussburger is seated at his 
               desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign 
               letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just 
               put them down.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmm... Thank you, Aloysius. This 
                         may be useful.

               Aloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave.

               As we TRACK IN ON the picture of Amy, we:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE UP TO:

               PERFECT WHITE

               After a beat, a woman ENTERS against the unblemished white 
               background, dressed in a flowing white dance robe, trailing 
               a long, diaphanous veil. She performs a flowingly sensuous 
               dance moderne; the MUSIC is a sensuous saxophone solo with 
               lasciviously bending blue notes.

               After the woman has been dancing for several beats Norville 
               enters, dancing after her, pursuing her. He is wearing a 
               coatless suit, his sleeves rolled up, his thin tie loosened.

               The woman dances around him, letting her diaphanous veil 
               trail sinuously around his body.

               We hear an ECHOING voice:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Buddy... Say, buddy...

               CLOSE SHOT - NORVILLE

               Sitting in his desk chair, sheened with sweat, eyes closed, 
               licking his lips.

               CLOSER NOW:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Buddy... Ya busy?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh-whuh?

               He opens his eyes and looks stuporously about.

               Buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator 
               cap.

                                     BUZZ
                         Looks like ya nodded off there, buddy! 
                         Say, ya got a minute?

               Norville clears his throat.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?

                                     BUZZ
                         I like to think so! It's this little 
                         idea I been working on!

               He turns an easel to face the desk.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Ya see, I don't intend to be an 
                         elevator boy forever! Take a look at 
                         this sweet baby!

               The easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper.

               Onto it has been rendered a top view, which is a perfect 
               circle, and a side view, which is a vertical line.

               Norville gazes stupidly at the circle.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Ya get it, buddy? Incredibly 
                         convenient, isn't it? Ya see --

               He produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting in 
               it.

                                     BUZZ
                         -- this is how it works, it's these 
                         little ridges on the side that give 
                         it its whammy! See, ya don't have to 
                         drink like this anymore --

               He holds his head over the glass to drink from the vertical 
               straw.

                                     BUZZ
                         -- Now you can drink like this --

               He bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...I call it the Buzz-Sucker, get 
                         it, buddy? -- After me! Buzz! Why, 
                         people are just dyin' for a product 
                         like this, and the great thing is we 
                         won't have to charge an arm and a --

               Norville, who has been stewing, finally barks:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Wait a minute!

               He grabs the lemonade glass, looks at it, sneering.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Why, this is worthless.

                                     BUZZ
                         Huh?! But, buddy --

               Norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up.

                                     NORVILLE
                         This is the most idiotic thing I've 
                         ever seen in my life!

                                     BUZZ
                         Yeah, but, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Nobody wants a hare-brained product 
                         like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks 
                         the creative spark, the unalloyed 
                         genius that made, uh...

               He pauses to belch.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...say, the hula hoop such a success.

                                     BUZZ
                         But, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         And what do you mean barging in here 
                         and taking up my valuable time! I've 
                         got a company to run here --

                                     BUZZ
                         But, buddy, you were --

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- I can't have every deadbeat on 
                         the Hudsucker payroll pestering me 
                         with their idiotic brainwaves!

                                     BUZZ
                         Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         An example must be made!

               Buzz looks over his shoulder, turns back to Norville.

                                     BUZZ
                         Wuddya mean, buddy?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Fired! You're fired! Is that plain 
                         enough for you, buster!

               Buzz's jaw drops. His elastic chin strap snaps under the 
               pressure.

                                     BUZZ
                         Awwww, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         And don't call me buddy! Out of here! 
                         Out!

               Buzz sinks to his knees, weeping. He clutches pathetically 
               at Norville's pants legs.

                                     BUZZ
                         Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's 
                         all I got!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Get up!

                                     BUZZ
                         I understand if ya don't like the 
                         Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, 
                         I'm prayin' to ya!

                                     NORVILLE
                         We don't crawl at Hudsucker 
                         Industries! Get out of my office!
                         Leave your uniform in the locker 
                         room!

               Buzz stumbles away, still weeping.

                                     BUZZ
                         I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

               As we TRACK IN ON Norville, laughing, there is a low, 
               unearthly RUMBLE, and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO:

               FLAMES

               We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized 
               lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar.

               He is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings 
               open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little 
               cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge. 
               He has a full golf bag over his shoulder.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine 
                         at Riverdale is really murder.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure, it's a tough course. 
                         Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought 
                         the board room would be a swell place 
                         to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're 
                         having some security problems here 
                         at the Hud.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Ya don't say.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you 
                         with it, but -- this is embarrassing, 
                         kid -- it seems to concern you 
                         directly.

                                     NORVILLE
                         How's that, Sid?

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         It's not important in itself --
                         some elevator boy you fired came to 
                         me claiming you'd stolen the idea 
                         for the, uh, the hoop dingus from 
                         him --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- 
                         maybe I was a little rough on the 
                         boy, ya see I --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to 
                         explain to me. He's a little person. 
                         He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily 
                         it would just be a nuisance. But it 
                         seems -- well, there was a spy in 
                         the company...

               He is shoving a file towards Norville, who opens it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Sure, sure, we tried to kill the 
                         story. But her newspaper won't play 
                         ball... Looks like her story's coming 
                         out...

               We TRACK DOWN the length of the board room table TOWARD 
               Norville, who stares horrified at the file.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...See, kid, the problem the Board'll 
                         have... you hired this woman. Kept 
                         her on, while she made a chump out 
                         of you. Serious error of judgment... 
                         I mean, business is war, kid -- ya 
                         take no prisoners, ya get no second 
                         chances. And a boner like this... 
                         I'm afraid when the Board meets, 
                         after New Year's, your position... 
                         well, it looks like you're finished... 
                         stick a fork in ya, you're done... 
                         washed up...

               We LOSE Mussburger FROM FRAME as we TIGHTEN FURTHER ON 
               Norville, Mussburger continuing off:

                                     MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
                         ...I'm sorry, kid. I understand this 
                         dolly who betrayed you, she used to 
                         be a friend of yours...

               Norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head.

                                     MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
                         ...And this elevator dope used to be 
                         a friend, too...

               Norville stares, perfectly still.

                                     MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
                         ...Well, they've got your throat 
                         pretty well slit. And when you're 
                         dead, ya stay dead. Ya don't believe 
                         me, ask Waring Hudsucker... Yeah, 
                         looks like curtains. Well, 
                         condolences, kid...

               Norville's IMAGE TURNS TO:

               BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGE OF NORVILLE

               We PULL BACK to show that it is on the front page of the 
               Manhattan Argus.

               The headline, in screaming nine-point type:

               FAKE!

               Next to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a 
               Fraud.

               Next to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator-
               operator's pillbox hat: Stole Hoop Idea from Genius Elevator 
               Jockey Clarence "Buzz" Gunderson.

                                     AMY (O.S.)
                         You can't print that!

                                     CHIEF
                         He grins wolfishly.

                                     CHIEF
                         We are printing it! She's hittin'
                         the streets this evening --

                                                              SWISH PAN TO:

                                     SMITTY
                         -- and she's dynamite!

                                     AMY
                         But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville 
                         showed me his design for the whatsit 
                         the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't 
                         have invented it -- look at the man -- 
                         he's an imbecile!

                                     CHIEF
                         Archer, you're a broken record. Fact 
                         is Gunderson did design it -- 
                         apparently he's some kind of prodigy --

                                     AMY
                         Says who?!

                                     SMITTY
                         You're not the only one with sources, 
                         Amy --

                                     CHIEF
                         Smith has a source on the Hud board -- 
                         very senior, very hushhush --

                                     AMY
                         Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are 
                         Sidney J. Mussburger!

                                     SMITTY
                         You've lost it, Aim. You've gone 
                         soft by the looks of it -- soft on 
                         the dummy from Dubuque --

                                     AMY
                         Muncie!

                                     CHIEF
                         Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, 
                         but this story is hot and you're no 
                         longer on top of it. Why, it's the 
                         scoop of the century -- the other 
                         papers won't have the Gunderson dope 
                         'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer 
                         Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking 
                         on our dust come mornin' --

                                     AMY
                         You're fools, both of you! It's 
                         obvious they're out to crucify 
                         Norville! They're trying to destroy 
                         him!

                                     CHIEF
                              (gently)
                         Amy -- take a break. You've worked 
                         hard on this story -- heck, you broke 
                         it for us! But it's passed you by 
                         and Smith here has taken up the slack.

               She is near tears.

                                     AMY
                         You want slack, I'll give you slack. 
                         You're not putting me out to pasture, 
                         Al, I quit! Consider this my 
                         resignation --

               She turns to Smitty --

                                     AMY
                         -- effective immediately!

               -- and swings -- but he catches her before contact, holds 
               her by the wrist, and sneers:

                                     SMITTY
                         ...Soft.

               Amy swings her free arm to -- thwack -- blindside his other 
               cheek.

               NORVILLE

               In flickering black-and-white, he is lying on a couch that 
               has been brought into his office, gazing listlessly at a 
               bend straw, being interviewed by someone O.S. The footage is 
               rough, taking a moment to find focus; the sound is TINNY.

                                     GERMAN VOICE (V.O.)
                         Dell me vat is first zing droppensie 
                         head ven I menzhon ze vord... Zex?

                                     NORVILLE (V.O.)

                         Aww, what's the difference.

               BOARD MEMBER

               Sitting in a darkened board room, gazing off at a screen 
               that sends flickering light onto his face.

                                     GERMAN VOICE (V.O.)
                         Und ven I zpeak of authority?

                                     NORVILLE (V.O.)
                         Awww, I dunno.

               BACK TO SCREEN

                                     GERMAN VOICE (V.O.)
                         Eggzplain please ze zignifikanz of

                                     NORVILLE (V.O.)
                         Nuthin', really.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               A shadow is thrown across the screen as a figure steps into 
               the beam. He throws the sharp silhouette of a strict Freudian 
               ANALYST: Van Dyke beard, pince-nez with chain trailing down 
               to his vest, one thumb hooked into the vest, the other hand 
               holding a cigar wreathing smoke, which he waves for emphasis.

                                     ANALYST
                         Patient dizplayed liztlessness, 
                         apathy, gloomy indifference und vas 
                         blue und mopey.

               The image on screen cuts to four inkblots. The Analyst sweeps 
               in a pointer and thwoks each image as he comments on it.

                                     ANALYST
                         ...Ven asked vut four Rhorschach

                         'Nussink much,' 'I don't know,' 'Chust 
                         a blotch,' und 'Sure beats me.'

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The image onscreen cuts to a close shot of Norville on the 
               couch, mouth listlessly agape.

                                     ANALYST
                         ...Patient shows no ambition, no get-

                         grand loopen-ze-loop --

               Image cuts to a sine wave on a graph, the top of which is 
               labeled "Euphoria," the bottom of which is labeled "Despair," 
               and a reference line through the middle labeled "Normal." 
               There is an X on the declining side of the wave, near but 
               not yet at the bottom, which is labeled "Patient."

                                     ANALYST
                         -- zat goes from ze peak of delusional

               Casually puffing on a cigar.

                         So patient is...?

               He interrogatively twirls a finger 'round his temple.

                                     BROMFENBRENNER
                         Prezizely. Knots.

               The board murmurs.

                         Prescription?

               As he scores each point it is illustrated on the screen behind 
               him: A patient is forced into a straitjacket by two brawny, 
               unshaven attendants; electricity arcs between two leads on a 
               wire cap being wielded by a technician; and lastly, a steel-
               barred door is slammed shut behind a stooped and broken 
               patient who is led, shuffling, away.

               Here the FILM runs out, CHATTERING, and the screen goes white.

               The projector is shut off and the lights go on.

               The board politely applauds.

               INT. BAR - CLOSE ON BARMAN

               He has a Vandyke beard and wears a cut-off sweatshirt and 
               dungarees and dark glasses, and has the phone wedged into 
               his shoulder as he tears open a large cardboard box.

                                     BARMAN
                         Yeah, just get down here -- he says 
                         he's a friend of yours... He won't 
                         say, but man, is he from squaresville.

               He hangs up and we HINGE WITH him to bring the length of the 
               bar into view. Norville dishevelled, is on the other side 
               bellowing.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I want a martini! It's New Year's 
                         Eve and I want a Martini!

                                     BARMAN
                         Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --

                                     NORVILLE
                         I thought you served misfits here!

               The barman is taking rolled-up blow-beepers out of the 
               cardboard box and loading them into tumblers to set along 
               the bar.

                                     BARMAN
                         Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we 
                         don't sell alcohol.

                                     NORVILLE
                         What kind of bar is it if ya can't 
                         get a martini?!

                                     BARMAN
                         It's a juice and coffee bar, man, 
                         like I been tellin' ya --

                                     NORVILLE
                         I want a martini! On this bar, right 
                         now! I've had a martini in every bar 
                         on the way down here, and I'm not 
                         about to --

                                     BARMAN
                         Martinis are for squares, man.

               Suddenly enraged:

                                     NORVILLE
                         What'd you call me?!

               He starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You son of a --

                                     AMY (O.S.)
                         Norville!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh?!

               He looks stupidly about, the shoulders of his coat down around 
               his elbows. He sees Amy rushing up.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit 
                         to buy your lunch?!

                                     AMY
                         Oh Norville, I --

               Norville's attention has already left her. He looks for the 
               missing bartender.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (swaying)
                         Barman! Set'm up, fella!

                                     AMY
                         Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to 
                         tell you... so many times... It's 
                         hard to admit when you've been wrong. 
                         If you could just... find it in your 
                         heart to -- to give me another chance --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hey! Where's that martini?!

                                     AMY
                         Just give me another chance, Norville -- 
                         I can help you fight this thing. I 
                         know this last story was a lie! We 
                         can prove it! We can --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Aww, what's the difference. I'm all 
                         washed up... When you're dead, ya 
                         stay dead... Hey, fella!

                                     AMY
                         Well that just about does it! I've 
                         seen Norville Barnes, the young man 
                         in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville 
                         Barnes the self-important heel, but 
                         I've never seen Norville Barnes the 
                         quitter, and I don't like it!

               She starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting.

                                     AMY
                         ...Fight on, fight on, dear old 
                         Muncie.

               She steps back off the stool. Norville watches her dully, 
               his head swaying.

                                     AMY
                         ...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue; 
                         You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin'
                         Once 'The Munce' is done with you! 
                         Goooooo Eagles!

               She looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at 
               her for a slack-jawed beat Norville can only bring out:

                                     NORVILLE
                         You lied to me! I can't believe you 
                         lied to me! a Muncie girl!

               He lurches off his stool toward the door. Watching him, 
               despair fights with confusion on Amy's face.

                                     AMY
                         But Norville... I...

               She realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple 
               innocent she loved --

                                     AMY
                         ... Oh, Norville!

               -- and bursts into tears.

               Two loud REVELERS reel INTO FRAME, one of them uncurling a 
               blow-beeper at the weeping Amy.

               WIPES UP INTO FRAME. Next to a picture of Norville is the 
               headline "MUNCIE MENTAL CASE." The subhead: "Hud Chief to

               Norville's hand ENTERS FRAME to push the newspaper away and 
               leave us looking up the empty street. Norville's back ENTERS 
               as he stumbles off alone up the street, pulling up his coat 
               collar as he recedes, the NEWSIE's VOICE continuing:

               trudging. VOICES WELL UP, ECHOING. A face looms with each 
               voice, hellishly lit, superimposed over the walking Norville:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         ...You're not so slow but you're not 
                         so swell either and it looks like

                         Noooo, I don't guess you will be 
                         here long... Sure, sure, but even

                         imbecile after all... Norville, you 
                         let me down... You let Mrs. Eisenhower 
                         down... You let the American people 
                         down... imbecile after all... 
                         imbecile... I predict you're going 
                         to lose all the good things your

                         official...

               This last voice and supered face is Mussburger's.

               Norville DISSOLVES away to leave us ON Sidney in the:

               INT. BOARDROOM

               Hellishly bottom-lit board members sit around the table, 
               conical New Year's hats on their heads. Mussburger, the only 
               one not wearing a cap, waves his cigar as he continues to 
               talk:

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...The barred-window boys are out

                         how Wall Street likes the news that 
                         the President of Hudsucker Industries 
                         is headed for the booby-hatch. Why, 
                         when the doc gets through with him 
                         he'll need diapers and a dribble 
                         cup...

               The board murmurs appreciatively.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Let me remind you that our secret 
                         post-New Year's party will be held 
                         in the office of the President shortly 
                         after midnight tonight. Remember, 
                         it's strictly stag, so leave the 
                         wives at home; we'll be showing some 
                         films and, yes, gentlemen, there 
                         will be exotic dancers.

               Louder murmuring. One board member leers, a trace of spittle 
               at the corner of his mouth.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Well, if that's all...

               With an unnatural rumble he straightens his papers and we...

                                                                JUMP UP TO:

               NORVILLE

               Norville trudges on, faster, sweatier.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Ring out the old! Ring in the new...!

               People come and go, laughing, talking, blowing noisemakers, 
               making merry.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         ...Ring out the old! Ring in the 
                         new! Ring out the --

               Thoomp!! Norville has run into someone. He looks up, dazed.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey, watch where you're -- Say, buddy!

               It is Buzz, the elevator boy, dressed in an ill-fitting tuxedo 
               and a conical party hat. Za-Za is on his arm, towering over 
               him, leering at Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, 
                         you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a 
                         fired you, I didn't know what I was 
                         doing! I was a little funny in the 
                         head, I --

                                     BUZZ
                         Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.

               Norville is stunned.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You don't?

                                     BUZZ
                         Nah, that's all forgotten.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...It is?

                                     BUZZ
                         Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I 
                         could have the job back.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --

                                     BUZZ
                         But he told me you stole that swell 
                         hoop idea from me. What gives!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, Buzz --

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, that was a swell idea!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, Buzz, you know I never --

                                     BUZZ
                         And Sid says you stole it!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But Buzz --

                                     ZA-ZA
                         Well wuddya waiting for, Clarence --
                         ? Pop him one!

               Boffo!

               Buzz swings and Norville hits the snow hard.

                                     BUZZ
                         Think about that, idea man!!

               Norville groggily raises his head.

                                     PASSERBY
                         Say, isn't he that lunatic?

               Norville looks dopily up at the people in furs and party 
               hats starting to gather.

                                     VOICES
                         ...that big-shot faker... the Wall

                         fruitcake... they say he's a menace... 
                         wuddya waitin' for, call a cop!...

               We hear SIRENS.

               Norville staggers to his feet. The crowd cringes.

                                     VOICES
                         ...He's on his feet... We can take 
                         him!

               Norville bursts through the crowd, running.

               Buzz starts giving chase, followed by the braver souls, 
               followed by the entire mob.

               NORVILLE

               runs, gasping, turning a corner.

                                     VOICES
                         ...Down here! He went down here!

               Behind Norville, the crowd rounds the corner, led by Buzz.

               A VAN is SCREECHING to a halt and out jump two burly unshaven 
               men in white, one of them holding open a straitjacket, the 
               other carrying a large butterfly net. They join in the chase.

               Norville turns down an alley. A DRUNK drooping off a lamppost 
               gaily waves a bottle at him.

                                     DRUNK
                         Ring out the old! Ring in the new!

               The crowd is running past the mouth of the alley, missing 
               the turn-off.

               LIMESTONE FLOOR

               Norville, gasping, crashes down INTO FRAME, his hands breaking 
               his fall against the limestone. The CAMERA SPINS NINETY 
               DEGREES to reveal that it is not floor but wall he has run 
               into and is now leaning against. Norville looks up, sweating, 
               gasping.

               HIS POV

               The massive Hudsucker Building looms dizzily up towards the 
               stars, capped by the huge Hudsucker Clock.

                         Ring out the old! Ring in the new!

               HUDSUCKER LOBBY

               Norville staggers in. A gust of icy air that comes in with 
               him flaps a dropcloth off a huge shape that dominates the 
               lobby:

               It is the heroic statue of Norville that we earlier saw him 
               posing for.

               Norville reels over to it, stares dumbly.

               STATUE

               Mutely -- mockingly -- dignified.

               NORVILLE

               He staggers off to the elevators.

               MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

               We are TRACKING ACROSS the office TOWARD Mussburger, his 
               feet up on his desk, laughing demonically, smoking his cigar. 
               CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS swing 
               on his desk; THRUMMMMM -- the SWEEP SECOND HAND of the clock, 
               illuminated now, casts a moving shadow that rolls across the 
               floor. Evil prevails.

               A piece of paper and a pencil lie on his desk; as we APPROACH 
               WE PAN DOWN and SWING AROUND to read it, LOSING Mussburger 
               but still hearing his LAUGHTER.

               MOVING IN ON THE PAPER:

               Musssucker Industries. Hudberger Industries. Sidsucker 
               Industries. This last alternative has been circled in red. 
               Below it has been scribbled:

               Sidney J. Mussburger, President.

               Evil LAUGHTER. Sweeping shadows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NORVILLE'S OFFICE DOOR

               We are TRACKING IN TOWARD the back of Aloysius, the sign 
               painter, who is stooped in front of the door. He looks back 
               over his shoulder, leering PAST the CAMERA, to reveal his 
               work: Under PRESIDENT Norville's name has been scraped away, 
               and painted in is SIDNEY J. MUSSBUR...

               NORVILLE

               He pushes past the sign painter.

               INT. OFFICE

               Dark and empty. Norville is peeling off his coat as he 
               staggers over to the closet.

               We can hear DISTANT REVELRY and the STRAINS of "AULD LANG 
               SYNE."

               Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet 
               and is putting it on: HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future Is Now.

               Norville looks at the door.

               THROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of 
               "Mussburger" being painted into place.

               Norville throws open the window.

               WIND WHISTLES.

               He climbs out.

               LEDGE

               Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down.

               We hear DISTANT CHANTING:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Ten... nine... eight... seven...

               HIS POV

               A sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far, 
               far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling 
               snow.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Six... five... four...

               WIDER ON NORVILLE

               We are FLOATING IN; it is the SHOT with which the movie began. 
               The sweep second hand of the Hudsucker Clock is approaching 
               the 12 of midnight, the New Year. In sync with the clock the 
               CHANTING continues:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Three... two...

               We have COME IN CLOSE ON Norville. A lone tear runs down his 
               cheek.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         ...One...

               BONG! The toll is right at Norville's ear. Startled, he 
               reaches up to press hands against his ears. Distantly:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Happy New Year!

               BONG!!

               He can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges 
               his way back toward the window.

               HIS POV

               The open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it 
               shut.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Norville waves.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No --

               BONG!!

               His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he 
               trips -- falls -- catches the ledge --

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- No, please!

               He is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. His feet 
               dangle away. Snow falls.

               HIS POV

               Looking STEEPLY UP.

               CLOCK

               Its second hand is making its descent.

               NORVILLE

               Falling.

               MUSSBURGER

               Laughing.

               SECOND HAND

               Descending.

               NORVILLE

               Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with a 
               great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, head 
               down, feet in the air.

               It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that 
               the title of the film was supered over.

               He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.

               PEOPLE IN STREET

               Frozen in attitudes of laughter, celebration. Snow sifts 
               silently down around their motionless bodies.

               MUSSBURGER

               In his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his 
               face.

               HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS

               Frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the 
               apex of its arc. Outside the great arched window, snow falls.

               NORVILLE

               He alone can move, but doesn't fall. He looks awkwardly about, 
               his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down.

               EXT. HUDSUCKER CLOCK

               Its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep.

               WHINING NOISES emanate from within.

               CLOSE SHOT - GREAT GEAR

               The broom handle has been jammed between two cogs, stopping 
               them. We PULL BACK ALONG the handle to reveal Moses, who has 
               thrust it there, and who now TURNS back over his shoulder to 
               address the CAMERA.

                                     MOSES
                         Strictly speakin', I'm never spozed 
                         to do this but... have you got a 
                         better idea?

               NORVILLE

               Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a DISTANT -- 
               very distant -- SINGING.

               HIS POV

               Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building. Someone or 
               something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down 
               from the stars.

               We can make out a male voice, accompanied by STRUMMING:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         She'll be comin' around the mountain 
                         when she comes, She'll be comin' 
                         around the mountain when she comes...

               NORVILLE

               He gapes.

               ANGEL

               -- For it is an Angel, arrives. He is a balding man, wearing 
               rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings 
               sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes 
               to rest, in midair. He puts aside the harp he has been 
               strumming on a nearby windowsill.

                                     ANGEL
                         Love that tune. How ya doin', kid?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Mr... Mr. Hudsucker?

                                     HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)
                         Ta-daaaa!

               Presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward 
               foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to 
               stamp. He lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Wooooo!

               He rights himself. The halo spinning lazily over his head 
               has been jarred askew. With a flick of his forefinger he 
               rights it.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...How d'ya like this thing? They're 
                         all wearin' em upstairs now.

               He blows a dismissive raspberry.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...It's a fad.

               He pats at his robe, produces a white cigar.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Anyway. I hear you've been having, 
                         uh...

               He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist, lighting it. 
               He lights the cigar off his thumb, takes a puff.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Been having some problems with 
                         the board. The more things change, 
                         know what Iyayayeeeeee...

               Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his 
               flaming thumb, which he now waves frantically about.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... 
                         Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I 
                         guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws 
                         to ya, huh, Norman?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Norville.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Mm. Well, say what you like about
                         the man's ethics, he's a balls-to-
                         the-wall businessman. Beat ya any 
                         way he can. Straight for the jugular. 
                         Very effective.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yes sir...

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Anyway. Any particular reason you 
                         didn't give him my Blue Letter? I 
                         mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying 
                         man's last words and wishes, no big 
                         deal.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I 
                         apologize, there was an awful lot of 
                         excitement and I guess I must've 
                         mislaid --

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         It's sittin' in your apron pocket, 
                         right where you left it. Imbecile.

               Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, geez.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is 
                         grounds for dismissal.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Geez, I --

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna 
                         add to your woes. I'm just saying.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yessir.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Well, why don't ya read it.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sir?

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yes sir...

               He tears open the envelope, reads:

                                     NORVILLE
                         'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. 
                         To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. 
                         My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you 
                         read this, I will have joined the 
                         organization upstairs -- an exciting 
                         new beginning. I will retain fond 
                         memories of the many years you and I --
                         '

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Yeah, yeah, it's the standard 
                         resignation boilerplate -- go down 
                         to the second paragraph.

                                     NORVILLE
                         'Many years, uh... I know that you 
                         will be wondering why I have decided 
                         to move on, ending my tenure at 
                         Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You 
                         will be thinking, Why now, when things 
                         are going so well? Granted, from the 
                         standpoint of our balance sheet and 
                         financials, sure, sure, we're doing 
                         fine. However, Sid. These things 
                         have long since ceased to give me 
                         pleasure. I look at myself now and 
                         no longer see the idealistic young 
                         man who started this company. Now I 
                         see only an empty shell whom others 
                         call a 'success.' How has this come 
                         to pass? When and why did I trade 
                         all of my hopes, dreams and 
                         aspirations, for the emptiness of 
                         power and wealth? What the heck have 
                         I done?

               As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails, 
               then pats down a yawn.

                                     NORVILLE
                         '...Looking back now, Sid, I see 
                         that I allowed time and age to corrupt 
                         my dreams. Instead of fiercely 
                         guarding what was timeless inside of 
                         myself, I let the hubbub of earthly 
                         commerce erode my character, and 
                         dissolve my better self. How is it 
                         that some manage to preserve 
                         themselves where I have failed? 
                         Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if 
                         others love you, you may more securely 
                         love yourself -- but I am alone. I 
                         loved a woman once, Sid, as you well 
                         know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, 
                         an angel who in her wisdom saw fit 
                         to choose you instead of I...'

               Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up.

               Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief.

               He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently 
               quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Skip this part...

               He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Last paragraph, last paragraph.

               Norville looks down the page.

                                     NORVILLE
                         '...And so, Sid, the future does not 
                         belong to such as I -- nor even you. 
                         We have made our compromises with 
                         time. The future belongs to the young, 
                         who may more energetically wage the 
                         battle against corruption. 
                         Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, 
                         and the ringing in of the new, I 
                         hereby bequeath my entire interest 
                         in the company, and my seat on the 
                         board, to whomever is Hudsucker's 
                         most recent employee at the time of 
                         my demise. I know this will disappoint 
                         you -- you, Sid, who have served so 
                         diligently and for so long. But --'

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         -- tough titty toenails!

               He roars with laughter.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...That'll show the bastard!

               He merrily wipes his eyes.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Yeah, go ahead.

                                     NORVILLE
                         '...But Sid, let me urge you to work 
                         closely with the new president, and 
                         to keep giving Hudsucker Industries 
                         all your energies -- but not your 
                         soul. For while we must strive for 
                         success, we must not worship it. 
                         Long live the Hud. Waring 
                         Hudsucker...'

               Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Geez.

               Pleased with himself:

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Yup. It's all there. Well, see that 
                         it gets delivered in the morning.

               Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the 
               stars.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Sheeel beeee...

               MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

               Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great 
               arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on 
               his way back to the heavens.

                                     HUDSUCKER

                         comes...

               We hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door.

               GEAR ROOM

               Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear.

               With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn --

               SWEEP SECOND HAND

               Lurching forward --

               PERPETUAL MOTION BALL

               Swinging down --

               EXT. PAVEMENT

               As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face 
               with one last mighty BONG of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.

               BOOM DOWN

               FROM a tavern sign that says ANN'S 440, DOWN TO the front 
               door, which Norville is entering.

               INT. ANN'S

               Sitting halfway down the bar is Amy, staring morosely into a 
               coffee cup. AT the CUT we are TRACKING BACK, PULLING AWAY 
               FROM her.

               Norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the Go Eagles 
               sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading 
               his fingers.

               Two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little 
               tipsy:

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         What the heck's he doin', Benny?

               Amy looks at Norville, startled. After a moment she 
               reciprocates the sign.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         What the heck's she doin', Lou?

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         What the heck they doin'?

               Norville and Amy embrace.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         You know what they're doin' now, 
                         Lou.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         This I know, Benny.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         This you're familia' with.

               Our PULL BACK ENDS LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the bar, TOWARDS 
               Norville and Amy, now in WIDE SHOT. Resting on the bar in 
               the extreme f.g. are two champagne glasses, half-full of 
               fizzing champagne.

               Norville and Amy kiss.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         ...Geez.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         ...Geez.

               We hear LABORED, RASPY BREATHING.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         ...Y'all right, Benny?

               In a quavering voice:

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         ...Yeah, I'm... It's just... It's 
                         beautiful, Lou!

               Lou also is beginning to sound choked up:

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         It is beautiful, Benny.

               Almost weeping as Norville and Amy continue their embrace:

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         ...It's the most beautiful t'ing I 
                         ever saw.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever 
                         saw.

               A BARTENDER ENTERS to BLOCK our VIEW of Norville and Amy.

               He is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a 
               sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves. He looks to either side at 
               Benny and Lou.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You cats comin' from a party?

                                     BENNY
                         Cabbies' affair.

                                     LOU
                         Hacks' New Year's gala.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Crazy. Get you anything else? Sangria? 
                         Carrot juice? Herbal tea?

               REVERSE ANGLE

               We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar.

               Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long 
               flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. On the bar next to him 
               sits a large hourglass.

                                     LOU
                         Bromo.

               Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby 
               bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly 
               that says "1959."

               He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in 
               air, then blows it back out.

                                     BENNY
                         ...Bromo.

               BLUE LETTER

               Lying on the boardroom table. As a hand enters to lay a 
               wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of 
               Moses, the old maintenance man.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         And so began 1959. The new year...

               The hand reenters to lay down a wallet, and then to deposit 
               a burning cigar in an ashtray.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...And the start of a new business 
                         cycle. When he learned that Norville 
                         owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was 
                         upset at first.

               We TILT UP to show that Mussburger is walking toward the 
               boardroom window. Board members silently remonstrate with 
               him as he tries to wrench it open.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...It's a good thing Doc 
                         Bromfenbrenner was there...

               Doctor Bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching, brow 
               furrowed, a pencil pressed to his lips.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...'cause he was able to keep Sidney 
                         from harmin' his ol' self.

               We...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARRED DOOR

               being slammed behind Sidney who, straight-jacketed, is puffing 
               on a cigar as he is led away.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...Now Norville, he went on an' ruled 
                         with wisdom and compassion...

               BOARDROOM

               Again. Norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on 
               an easel: Under the heading BRAND NEW is a large circle. The 
               side view is a flat line.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...and started dreamin' up them 
                         excitin' new ideas again. You know, 
                         for kids!

               The board members look at the design, puzzled.

               Norville takes a drop cloth off of a piece of plastic on a 
               pedestal. He has the board's complete attention.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...An' that's the story of how 
                         Norville Barnes climbed away up to 
                         the forty-fourth floor of the 
                         Hudsucker Buildin'...

               He picks up the plastic disc and as he sails it we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE

               As it floats out the boardroom window.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...an' then fell all the way down, 
                         but didn't quite squish hisself.

               We BOOM UP, AWAY FROM the boardroom, to the great Hudsucker 
               Clock.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...Ya know, they say there was a man 
                         who jumped from the fortyfifth 
                         floor... but that's another story. 
                         Heh-heh-heh! Ya-heh-heh-heh!

               We FADE OUT on the clock as Moses' LAUGHTER grows distant 
               and END MUSIC SWELLS.

                                         THE END

               BLACK

               No image. A bleak WIND MOANS. HOLD.

               With a STINGING CHORD we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958)

               Lights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS.

               After a beat, the voice of an elderly black man:

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         The's right... New York.

               We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets 
               far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling 
               snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING.

               We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers 
               slip by left and right.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo' 
                         minutes it is. Come midnight it's 
                         gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother 
                         feelin'. The New Year. The future...

               The SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is 
               "Auld Lang Syne."

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to 
                         start one mo' trip 'round the sun, 
                         an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round 
                         be a little mo' giddy, a little mo' 
                         gay...

               We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top 
               is a large illuminated clock.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         Yep...

               We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...All over town champagne corks is 
                         a-poppin'.

               A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Over in the Waldorf the big shots 
                         is dancin' to the strains of Guy 
                         Lombardo... Down in Times Square the 
                         little folks is a-watchin' and a-
                         waitin' fo' that big ball to drop...

               The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant 
               CROWD: "Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!"

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...They all tryin' to catch holt a 
                         one moment of time...

               The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the 
               WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we 
               begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads 
               a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name: 
               "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES." Below it, in neon, the company's 
               motto: "THE FUTURE IS NOW."

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...to be able to say -- 'Right now! 
                         This is it! I got it!' 'Course by 
                         then it'll be past.
                              (more cheerfully)
                         But they all happy, evvybody havin' 
                         a good time.

               We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the 
               clock. The window starts to open.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Well, almost evvybody. They's a 
                         few lost souls floatin' 'round out 
                         there...

               A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge.  
               With the opening of the window, "AULD LANG SYNE" filters out 
               with greater volume.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...This one's Norville Barnes.

               The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps 
               in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on 
               the apron: "HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now."

               He looks with nervous determination into the void.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Let's move in for a closer look.

               The CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...That office he jes stepped out of 
                         is the office of the president of 
                         Hudsucker Industries. It's his 
                         office...

               Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows 
               louder and the WIND blows in his face.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...How'd he get so high? An' why is 
                         he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna 
                         do it -- is Norville really gonna 
                         jelly up the sidewalk?

               Norville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge, 
               preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the 
               CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME.

               We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL 
               THRUM becomes very loud indeed.

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...Well the future, that's something 
                         you can't never tell about...

               The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare 
               seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES 
               UP: "Nine! Eight! Seven!"

                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                         ...But the past... That's another 
                         story...

               OVER BLACK

               The HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE and 
               GRINDING GEARS as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DESTINATION DISPLAY

               On the front of a bus just rocking to a halt. The display 
               says "MUNCIE-NEW YORK."

               LINE OF BAGS

               is being set out on the pavement. A man with the cuffs of a 
               redcap uniform swings one into the f.g.:

               It has a sticker on it: CLASS OF '58, and below an 
               illustration of crossed right and left hands, their thumbs 
               hooked and fingers spread like wings: MUNCIE COLLEGE OF 
               BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.

               After a beat the hand of its claimant ENTERS to pick it up.

               FOLLOWING the bag as its owner carries it down the street. 
               He pauses, sets it down.

               YOUNG MAN

               Fresh-faced, eager -- NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at:

               WESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

               The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock 
               shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture 
               window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures 
               board in a great train station, with each of its individual 
               entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new 
               opportunity. On offer are jobs like: PASTRY CHEF, STEAMFITTER, 
               LAY-OUT MAN, GRAVEDIGGER, etc.

               REVERSE

               On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the 
               board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and 
               vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug 
               into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads, 
               bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering 
               board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a 
               prospect they like.

               Norville stands pat, watching.

               HIS POV

               An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.

               NORVILLE

               He brightens.

               BOARD

               We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.

               NORVILLE

               He frowns.

               Around him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply 
               for their respective jobs.

               We see other entries: JUNIOR EXECUTIVE. PAN TO EXPERIENCE 
               ONLY. EXECUTIVE MANAGER... MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE.  
               BUSINESSMAN... EXPERIENCED.

               The CROSS-CUTTING ENDS in a wash of SUPER-IMPOSITIONS PANNING 
               OVER Norviille, now alone on the sidewalk:

               EXPERIENCED ONLY... EXPERIENCED... EXPERIENCED... 
               EXPERIENCED...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE SHOT - EXECUTIVE

               A middle-aged, mousy-looking man in a conservative suit and 
               wire-rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks to someone 
               O.S. Behind the Executive we see only the skyline of New 
               York City.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         -- So in the third quarter we saw no 
                         signs of weakening. We're up 18 
                         percent over last year's third quarter 
                         gross and, needless to say, that's a 
                         new record...

               TRACKING

               DOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table. Executives line 
               either side. We are APPROACHING the man at the far end of 
               the table, to whom the report is being directed.

               He is late middle-aged, dressed expensively but 
               conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive 
               who drones on.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...The competition continues to flag 
                         and we continue to take up the slack. 
                         Market share in most divisions is 
                         increasing and we've opened seven 
                         new regional offices...

               The TRACK has ENDED IN a CLOSEUP of the man at the end of 
               the table, who still smiles benignantly at the droning 
               Executive. The smile is serene, almost otherwordly.

               This is WARING HUDSUCKER.

               REPORTING EXECUTIVE

               He drones on.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...Our international division has 
                         also shown vigorous upward movement 
                         in the past six months and we're 
                         looking at some exciting things in 
                         R&D...

               The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OFF the droning Executive as the big 
               man's attention apparently wanders; we FRAME UP ON the picture 
               window skyline of New York.

                                     EXECUTIVE (V.O.)

                         about sub-franchising; we're making 
                         so much money in sub-franchising it 
                         isn't even funny.

               FOLDED-BACK WANT ADS

               A hand with pencil goes down a list of positions, ticking 
               each one: STREETSWEEPER -- EXPERIENCED; LINOTYPE MAN --
               EXPERIENCED; CANTOR (REFORM) -- EXPERIENCED; SPARRING PARTNER -- 
               EXPERIENCED.

               WIDER

               Norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil 
               down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm.

               His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs 
               his coffee with his spoon.

               He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down 
               on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change, 
               turning it inside-out.

               CLOSE ON COUNTER

               As Norville puts all his change on the counter. His hand 
               hesitates; he takes a little of it back. He LEAVES FRAME.

               A waitress's hand ENTERS from the far side of the counter. 
               She clears away the saucer, then the cup -- which has been 
               resting on the want ads. It leaves a perfect brown circle 
               around one entry:

               As we hear the COFFEESHOP DOOR OPENING O.S., a draft wafts 
               the sheet of newspaper off the counter and OUT OF FRAME.

               NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE

               Again LOOKING THROUGH the WINDOW as, O.S., the reporting 
               Executive drones on.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...Our owned-and-operateds are 
                         performing far above expectations 
                         both here and abroad, and the Federal 
                         Tax Act of 1958 is giving us a swell 
                         writeoff on our plant and heavies...

               WARING HUDSUCKER

               looks dreamily out the window. His attention returns to the 
               droning Executive and the benignant smile returns to his 
               lips.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...The news in the money market isn't 
                         good -- it's excellent...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NORVILLE'S BACK

               He walks dejectedly down the street, hands shoved into his 
               pockets.

               A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it 
               this way and that.

               Slap! -- It plasters against another pedestrian, who bats it 
               away.

               The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against 
               Norville.

               He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops, 
               noticing something.

               NEWSPAPER SCRAP

               It is a section of the want ads. One entry is perfectly 
               circled by a coffee stain.

               BACK TO NORVILLE

               He looks up from the paper. There is purpose in his gaze.  
               Wind whips his hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE SHOT - WARING HUDSUCKER

               As the Executive drones on, O.S., Hudsucker is carefully 
               winding his wristwatch.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...Our nominees and assigns continue 
                         to multiply and expand extending our 
                         influence regionally, nationally and 
                         globally. So, third quarter and year-
                         to-date, we've set a new record for 
                         sales...

               Hudsucker looks up from his watch, smiles, runs his palms 
               back over his fringe of hair.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...new record in gross...

               Hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right 
               amount under the suit.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...new record in pre-tax earnings...

               Hudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully sets 
               it in his ashtray.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...new record in after-tax profit...

               He deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at its 
               face.

               The sweep second hand is starting the last revolution that 
               will end at precisely noon.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...and our stock has split twice 
                         this year...

               Hudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table.

                                     EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                         ...In short...

               Savoring a pause, the Executive looks around the board table.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...we're loaded.

               This draws an appreciative chuckle from the board. It is cut 
               off by:

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Ahem...

               The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the 
               f.g. Beyond him is the length of the board table and the 
               large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and 
               deliberately, and rubs his palms together.

               He swings his chair out.

               He steps up onto the chair.

               The board stares.

               He steps up from the chair onto the board table.

               The heads of the board members swing up in unison.

               Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension 
               loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his 
               sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         ...Mr. Hudsucker?

               The hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP, as 
               Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the b.g., towards the office 
               building across the street. Its street number tops its 
               imposing entryway in large gilt letters: 285.

               We continue TILTING UP the length of the skyscraper, to reveal 
               a huge clock capping its facade. Above the clock is the 
               identification "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES."  Below the clock is 
               the motto "THE FUTURE IS NOW."

               The huge clock's sweep second hand is just approaching the 
               position that will make the time 12:00 sharp.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As the second hand hits the twelve, the CLOCK TOLLS, the 
               board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker comes flying 
               out.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh...

               SECRETARIAL AREA

               Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building. A secretary sits typing 
               next to an open window, finished pages sitting stacked beside 
               her. As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...

               As Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the 
               stack of papers wafting this way and that. As the secretary 
               turns to look out the window, FREEZE FRAME (wafting papers 
               have their motion arrested) and SUPER A TITLE.

               TRACKING

               WITH Hudsucker, the building slipping by behind him. As he 
               yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair. 
               The CLOCK TOLLS.

               FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.

               HOT DOG VENDOR

               on the street, handing a steaming frank to a customer who is 
               handing him some change. As we hear the APPROACHING HUDSUCKER, 
               both men look up. As the CLOCK TOLLS:

               FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.

               PASSERBY ON SIDEWALK

               The man, wearing a fedora, is in the f.g. of an EXTREME LOW 
               ANGLE whose b.g. is the bottom three or four stories of the 
               Hudsucker Building.

               The passerby reacts to the approaching yell, looking up just 
               as Hudsucker ENTERS FRAME.

               FREEZE FRAME to suspend Hudsucker a good twenty feet above 
               the sidewalk, arms and legs splayed, comically arrested. The 
               passerby is frozen in an attitude of surprise and disbelief.

               SUPER the title of the film: THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.

               UNFREEZE to send Hudsucker plummeting THROUGH the FRAME to 
               his rendezvous with the sidewalk, BELOW FRAME.

               DUTCH ANGLE

               The Hudsucker Building lists up into the distance. A woman 
               in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises INTO FRAME AT 
               an OPPOSING SLANT. Looking down at the sidewalk, she sends 
               two dismayed hands to her cheek and screeeeeeeeeams.

                                                       DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

               EXT. TOP FLOOR

               With the LAST TOLL of the CLOCK punctuating the CUT, we are 
               FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window.

               The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING, 
               MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN.

               THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting 
               around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and 
               disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g.

               At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and 
               oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray.

               There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak 
               table.

               One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to 
               his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to 
               his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from 
               his nose.

               We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.

               SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle-
               aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a 
               commanding presence.

               He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his 
               knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members' 
               heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately 
               for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader. 
               Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers.

               Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair.

               He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's 
               ashtray.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.

               The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.

                                     AN EXECUTIVE
                         He could've opened the window.

                         Waring Hudsucker never did anything 
                         the easy way.

                                     ADDISON
                         My God, why?! Why did he do it?!
                         Things were going so well!

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the 
                         man was unhappy.

                                     ADDISON
                         He didn't look unhappy!

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Yeah, well, he didn't look rich.

                         Waring Hudsucker was never an easy 
                         man to figure out.
                              (reminiscing)
                         He built this company with his bare 
                         hands. Every step he took was a step 
                         up. Except of course this last one.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but 
                         when the president, chairman of the 
                         board and holder of eighty-seven 
                         percent of the company's stock drops 
                         forty-four floors --

                         -- Then the company has a problem.
                         Stillson, what exactly is the 
                         disposition of Waring's stock?

                                     STILLSON
                         Well, as you know, Hud left no will 
                         and had no family. The company bylaws 
                         are quite clear in that event. His 
                         entire portfolio will be converted 
                         to common stock and will be sold 
                         over the counter as of the first of 
                         the fiscal year following his demise.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Meaning?

                                     STILLSON
                         Meaning simply that Waring's stock, 
                         and control of the company, will be 
                         available to the public on January 
                         first.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         You mean to tell me that any slob in 
                         a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy 
                         Hudsucker stock?

               Stillson shrugs.

                                     STILLSON
                         The company bylaws are quite clear.

                         My God! You're animals! How can you 
                         discuss his stock when the man has 
                         just leapt forty-five floors --

                         Quit showboating, Addison, the man 
                         is gone. The question now is whether 
                         we're going to let John Q. Public 
                         waltz in and buy 87 percent of our 
                         company.

                         What're you suggesting, Sidney?
                         Certainly we can't afford to buy a 
                         controlling interest.

                         fifteen... sign the voucher, uh, 
                         waiver... cover for Mr. Anatole...  
                         he's a swell guy... Morgatross...  
                         He was on, uh...

               He is COASTING ACROSS the "K" mail slots, finally COMES TO 
               Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max 
               Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others. 
               The envelope will not fit in.

               He frowns.

               He is about to fold the envelope, but notices something 
               stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD.

               Norville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see 
               envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in 
               rapid succession, left to right.

               CLOSEUP - ANCIENT SORTER

               An old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail.

               Without ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed 
               back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking 
               pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his 
               left hand.

               ANCIENT SORTER'S SHELF

               As his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots.

               NORVILLE

               He raises his voice over the mailroom din:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Say, what do you do when the envelope 
                         is too big for the slot?

               The ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking 
               his mail.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Well... if ya fold 'em, they fire 
                         ya...

               Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         ...I usually throw 'em out.

               Norville takes out a pencil and writes on the face of the 
               envelope:

               INSERT - LETTER

               Dear Mr. Kloppit, Please give this letter to your son. Thank 
               you, Norville Barnes.

               After a moment he adds:

               Your friend in the mailroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     NORVILLE
                              (talking as he writes)
                         Just got hired today!

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Terrific.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Ya know, entry level!

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Tell me about it.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I got big ideas, though!

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         I'm sure you do.

                                     NORVILLE
                         For instance, take a look at this 
                         sweet baby...

               Norville is taking an envelope from his pocket and handing 
               it to the Ancient Sorter.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...you look like you can keep a 
                         secret...

               The Ancient Sorter is pulling a ragged piece of paper from 
               the envelope. On the paper is a crudely-drawn circle.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Something I developed myself.  
                         Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs.

               The Ancient Sorter looks questioningly from the circle to 
               Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (explains)
                         ...You know, for kids!

               The Ancient Sorter nods with feigned understanding as Norville 
               takes the paper back.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Terrific.

                                     NORVILLE
                         So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom 
                         long.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                              (deadpan)
                         Nooo, I don't guess you will be.

               He resumes his sorting.

                                     NORVILLE
                         How long've you been down here?

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Forty-eight years...

               Whisk. Whisk.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         ...Next year they move me up to 
                         parcels...

               Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.

               A BELL CLANGS.

               The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SPUTTERS to life.

                                     PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         Attention Hudsucker employees.  We 
                         regretfully announce that at 12:01 
                         this afternoon, Hudsucker time, Waring 
                         Hudsucker, Founder, President, and 
                         Chairman of the Board of Hudsucker 
                         Industries, merged with the infinite. 
                         To mark this occasion of corporate 
                         loss, we ask that all employees 
                         observe a moment of silent 
                         contemplation.

               All HUBBUB ABRUPTLY STOPS and the sounds of HEAVY MACHINERY, 
               HISSING STEAM PIPES, and GENERATORS WIND DOWN TO leave total 
               SILENCE. After a moment:

                                     PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         ...Thank you for your kind attention. 
                         This moment has been duly-noted on 
                         your time cards and will be deducted 
                         from your pay. That is all.

               The MACHINERY GROANS back INTO ACTION and the people return 
               to their jobs just as:

               A STEAM WHISTLE SCREECHES.

               ALARM BELLS go OFF.

               From the PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM:

                                     PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         'Blue letter! Blue letter!'

               The mail room is thrown into pandemonium.

                                     VARIOUS VOICES
                         Blue letter...! It's a blue letter...! 
                         They're bringing down a blue letter!

               One MAN spins to face the CAMERA, his hands pressed over his 
               ears. STEAM JETS and HISSES behind him.

                                     MAN
                         Blue letter!!

               Animated for the first time:

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         Jumpin' Jehosephat, a blue letter!

               Mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept out of 
               the crowded aisle to form a clear path running down to an 
               elevator in the b.g.

               With a SIREN SOUND, a light above the elevator goes on.

               The elevator door sweeps open. It reveals a wall into which 
               a four-foot high hinged door is set.

               This door swings open and an old dwarf emerges: Old man 
               HUTCHINSON, the boss of the mailroom. He emerges from the 
               blinding light of the interior of the elevator.

               He is holding aloft a letter.

               He takes loping drawf strides down the aisle.

               CLOSEUP - LETTER

               TRACKING ON letter as Hutchinson bears it along. In the b.g., 
               the faces that the letter passes are agog.

               CROSSCUT the approaching blue letter WITH: Norville and the 
               Ancient Sorter.

               BACK TO SCENE

               The Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's 
               ear.

                                     ANCIENT SORTER
                         It's a blue letter... top, top 
                         level... confidential communication 
                         between the brass... usually bad 
                         news... they hate blue letters 
                         upstairs... Hate 'em!

               Norville gulps.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         You!

               Norville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has 
               disappeared.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         ...Yeah, you! Barnes!

               As he points, the people around Norville shrink away.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         ...You don't look busy! Think you 
                         can handle a blue letter?
                              (laughs sadistically)
                         ...This letter was sent down this 
                         morning by the big guy himself! 'At's 
                         right, Waring Hudsucker! It's 
                         addressed to Sid Mussburger!  
                         Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a 
                         blue letter! That means you put it 
                         right in Mussburger's hand. No 
                         secretaries! No receptionists! No 
                         colleagues! No excuses!

               DRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts 
               the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it 
               with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we 
               are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face.

               COMPLEMENTARY TIGHT DUTCH ANGLE ON HUTCHINSON

               We can see the veins in his eyes, the veins in his nose, the 
               hairs in his ears.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         Mussburger!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEVATOR DOORS

               ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator 
               who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform, 
               white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched 
               onto his breast pocket.

               As Norville enters the elevators:

                                     BUZZ
                         Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got 
                         the fuzz...

               He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then 
               lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his 
               head.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...I make the elevator do what she 
                         duzz!

               He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he 
               snaps it away and pats down his crewcut:

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Hang it up to dry.

               He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's 
               knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed 
               to it.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...What's your pleasure, buddy?

                                     NORVILLE
                              (regaining his balance)
                         Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --

                                     BUZZ
                         Forty-four, the top brass floor say, 
                         buddy! What takes fifty years to get 
                         up to the top floor and thirty seconds 
                         to get down?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I --

                                     BUZZ
                         Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
                         Say, buddy!

               With a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator 
               to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia, 
               painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator.

               Buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter.

                                     BUZZ
                         Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, 
                         personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven.

                                     MR. LEVIN
                         Thirty-six.

                                     BUZZ
                         Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen, 
                         step to the rear; here comes 
                         gargantuan Mr. Grier.

               An obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar:

                                     FAT MAN
                         Buzz.

               Buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator 
               into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks 
               only a little under the G-force.

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid 
                         businessman on the street?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I --

                                     BUZZ
                         Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!
                         Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk 
                         fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' 
                         Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!

               He turns to look at Norville.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun, 
                         it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on 
                         Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a 
                         blue letter?!

               All heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those 
               near Norville shrink away.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a 
                         guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express 
                         to the top floor!

               The ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEVATOR DOORS

               Sweeping open. Norville staggers out.

                                     BUZZ
                              (hissing)
                         Good luck, buddy!

               The door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around.

               Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again.

                                     BUZZ
                         -- You'll need it!

               The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES SCREAM 
               as it power-dives away.

               Norville turns toward the executive offices.

               Plush, thick-carpeted silence.

               Norville starts walking.

               A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive 
               quiet. Norville looks to one side.

               A workman in painter's overalls squats in front of a pair of 
               heavy oak doors. With a razor blade he is scraping off the 
               name "WARING HUDSUCKER."

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Mr. Mussburger's office?

               The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville.

               With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction.

               Norville enters the adjacent office.

               OUTER OFFICE

               Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office. 
               The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the 
               f.g., her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder, 
               as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious 
               sneer which stays pasted on throughout.

               The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated behind 
               a desk in the b.g. that flanks the door to Mussburger's 
               private office. The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped 
               on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered 
               down-from-under look of a patient vulture.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Do you have an appointment?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Uhh, no, I --

               The filing secretary sneers.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm?

               She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed crinkly 
               pages.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in 
                         the --

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         We don't seem to be in the boooook.

               Norville is groping in his apron pocket.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No, ma'am, ya see I don't have an --

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         If we had an appointment we'd be in 
                         the booook.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I know but ya see I have this -- 
                         here it is, this letter --

               A low, unearthly WAIL fills the room, the sound of a million 
               souls moaning in purgatory.

               The Receptionist looks up.

               FAST TRACK IN ON SNEERING FILE SECRETARY

               who is no longer sneering. Her mouth is stretched wide as 
               she wails and her finger points...

               FAST TRACK IN ON BLUE LETTER

               that Norville holds innocently at his side.

               BACK TO TRACK IN ON WAILING SECRETARY

               As her wail becomes deafening and we TRACK INTO her mouth 
               and the SCREEN GOES BLACK and:

               CLICK

               The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound 
               of a DOOR OPENING. We are:

               INT. MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

               its door swinging open to admit Norville.

               In the b.g., in the outer office, we can see the filing 
               secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag 
               draped across her forehead. The Receptionist is fanning her 
               with a towel.

               The door closes behind Norville.

               We hear a rhythmic CLICK-CLICK-CLICK and the HUM of 
               VENTILATION.

               NORVILLE'S POV

               Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which 
               is a large executive chair facing the window. From above the 
               back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up. A telephone cord 
               snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden from 
               us. On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large 
               swinging ball bearings. Click-click-click.

               A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in the 
               far corner of the office.

               A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the 
               Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES by 
               immediately outside the window, describing an arc that throws 
               a moving shadow across the office.

               His BACK TO us, into the phone:

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         -- Sure sure, Parkinson's stupid but 
                         he's ambitious, too hard to control...

               He swivels around to face Norville, who stands deferentially 
               at the door. Still listening at the phone, Mussburger waves 
               Norville forward.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...No! Not McClanahan; sure he bungled 
                         the Teleyard merger, but that means 
                         he's got something to prove...

               He covers the mouth piece.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Who let you in?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I --

               Into the phone:

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Atwater? Tremendous. Except I fired 
                         him last week --

               The INTERCOM BUZZES fiercely.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs.

               Mussburger hits the intercom.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Tell him I'll be right there...
                              (looks at Norville)
                         Well, what is it?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I --

               But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from 
               the PHONE.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         You, maybe you're the company's 
                         biggest moron. We can't use Morris, 
                         he's been with us too long, he's a 
                         nice guy, too many friends. Matter 
                         of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- 
                         scratch that; I'll fire him.
                              (looks up at Norville)
                         ...Make it fast, make it fast.

                                     NORVILLE
                         You --

               The INTERCOM SQUAWKS.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Bumstead is getting very --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         I'll be right there. Give him a 
                         magazine.
                              (to Norville)
                         ...What're you, a mute?

               The second PHONE on Mussburger's desk RINGS.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Yeah, how's the stock doing?
                         ...Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough.
                              (into the first phone)
                         ...Look, chump, either you find me a 
                         grade A ding-dong or you can tender 
                         your key to the executive washroom.
                              (into the second phone)
                         And that goes double for you.
                              (into the first phone)
                         Ear-clay?
                              (into both phones)
                         Ood-gay!
                              (slams down both 
                              phones, looks at 
                              Norville)
                         This better be good. I'm in a bad 
                         mood.

               Norville clears his throat.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, sir. I've got something for 
                         you from the mailroom, but first if 
                         I could just take a minute or so 
                         from your very busy time...

               He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper 
               across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at 
               Norville, making no move to take the paper.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...to show you a, uh...

               Norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger 
               will not take it. Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his 
               eyes are locked on Norville's. Mussburger smolders.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...a little something I've been 
                         working on for the last two or three 
                         years...

               Mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look 
               at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at 
               Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You know, for kids! Which is 
                         perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I 
                         claim to be any great genius; like 
                         they say, inspiration is 99 percent 
                         perspiration, and in my case I'd say 
                         it's at least twice that, but I gotta 
                         tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this 
                         sweet baby --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Wait a minute!

               Sudden quiet.

               With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings 
               abruptly stop.

               As Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute 
               and paralyzed.

               His eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk. 
               He stands toe-to-toe with Norville.

               He thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves 
               reflexively back. Mussburger's nose is almost touching 
               Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying, 
               evaluating.

               Finally he draws his head back.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmm...

               With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping 
               mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that 
               his teeth clench it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Umm-hmm...

               He steps back, eyes still on Norville.

               He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair 
               behind the desk.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Siddown.

               Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, 
               looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Go ahead. Try it on.

               Norville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Put your feet up.

               Norville is again reluctant.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Go ahead.

               Norville obeys. Mussburger studies.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmmm... Let's get to know one 
                         another, shall we?

               Norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing 
               from between his teeth. Mussburger seems to relax.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Let's chat!
                              (beams)
                         ...Man to man!

               Norville beams.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...You weren't blessed with much...

               He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a 
               euphemism.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...education, were you?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I'm a college graduate --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         All right, but you didn't excel in 
                         your studies...?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I made the dean's list.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (worried)
                         Hmmm.

               Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke.

                                     NORVILLE
                         At the Muncie College of Business 
                         Administration.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (relieved)
                         Sure, sure. And did your classmates 
                         there call you 'jerk' or...
                              (searches again)
                         ...'schmoe'?

               Norville shakes his head.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 
                         'Lamebrain'?

                                     NORVILLE
                         No, sir.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Not even behind your back?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sir! They voted me most likely to 
                         succeed!

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (curtly)
                         You're fired.

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, sir! --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Get your feet off that desk.

               As he struggles to comply:

                                     NORVILLE
                         But --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Get out of my sight.

               Norville, squinting against the cigar smoke, pulls the cigar 
               out of his mouth as he doubles forward, feet still up, groping 
               for a place to set down the cigar. He sets it blindly on a 
               loose stack of papers.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         My God! The Bumstead contracts!!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               The top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the 
               cigar's live end.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         You nitwit! I worked for three years 
                         on this deal!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         I'll take care of it. Just get out!

               Mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it 
               into a wastebasket. He pats the fingertips of one hand against 
               his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange 
               circle on the top sheet of the contract.

               At the other end of the office, Norville is wrapping his 
               arms around the glass water tank, which he pulls off its 
               base. He runs back across the vast expanse of office toward 
               the desk, hugging the water tank whose WATER GLOOB-GLOOBS 
               out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees.

               As he reaches the desk, the near-empty tank is now light 
               enough for him to hoist with one arm, which he does, and 
               cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water. 
               He tosses the TANK to the floor where --

               CRASH -- it SHATTERS, and stands looking about for a place 
               to dump his handful of water.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed 
                         the most sensitive deal of my career!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk, 
               which Mussburger cannot see.

               It is sprouting flame, at which Norville ineffectually flecks 
               his remaining drops of water.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Now out of here! Out!

               Norville is already running to the window, which he runs 
               both palms over, desperately seeking a way to open it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Not that way! Through the door!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, sir!

               The windows do not open. Norville furiously stomps on the 
               flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks.

               Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up 
               and down with his foot.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Right away, buster! Out of my office!

               Norville has dropped to the floor, trying to wrench the 
               flaming wastebasket off his leg.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Up on your feet! We don't crawl at 
                         Hudsucker Industries!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sir, my leg is on fire!

               Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket 
               off his foot. Now the problem is what to do with it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Get out of this office, you dithering 
                         nincompoop!

               Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               He winds up and throws it through the closed window.

               The GLASS SHATTERS and the flaming basket plummets to 
               oblivion.

               With the picture window broken a FEROCIOUS DRAFT ROARS through 
               the penthouse office.

               CLOSE SHOT - BUMSTEAD CONTRACTS

               On the desk. The pages are sucked away by the draft.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         My God! The Bumstead contracts!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh my God, sir!

               Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out 
               the window.

               He runs, jumps onto the sill, grabs -- his fist clenches 
               around one wafting page -- he is about to fall --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM

               BUMSTEAD, a short, fat, heavily perspiring executive, is 
               screaming at an O.S. secretary. He holds a pot of coffee in 
               one hand and a copy of Boy's Life in the other.

                                     BUMSTEAD
                         No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger! 
                         I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he 
                         jump out a window too?!

               In the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper 
               fluttering down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NORVILLE

               Desperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. 
                         I gotcha by your pants!

               Mussburger's screaming abruptly stops.

               CLOSEUP - MUSSBURGER'S HORROR-STRICKEN FACE REMEMBERING (THE 
               SCREEN GOES WATERY):

               MUSSBURGER

               is in a basement tailor shop. LUIGI, an old Italian tailor, 
               is just running his tape up Mussburger's inseam.

                                     LUIGI
                         Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you 
                         pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make 
                         'em strong, and they look-a real 
                         sharp.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (barking)
                         No! Single stitch is fine.

                                     LUIGI
                              (begging)
                         But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, 
                         the dooble stitch she last-a forever --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Why on earth would I need a double 
                         stitch? To pad your bill? Single 
                         stitch is fine!

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

                         Damn!

               We hear a LOUD TEARING sound O.S. Mussburger drops a few 
               inches.

                                                             QUICK WIPE TO:

                              (musing to himself)
                         What the heck. Meester Moosaburger 
                         such a nice-a guy, I give him dooble 
                         steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong-
                         a steech-a, you bet!

               BACK TO MUSSBURGER'S PANTS

               The tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops; the rest of 
               the pants hold intact.

               MUSSBURGER

               sighs with relief.

               He looks up.

               NORVILLE

               Norville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the 
               heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face.

               MUSSBURGER

               Looking. Thinking.

               NORVILLE

               Struggling to hold on.

               MUSSBURGER

               Calm. Contemplating.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmm...

               He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks 
               it in his mouth. He holds his lighter under the cigar, not 
               noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way.

               He looks at Norville.

               NORVILLE

               His face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on.

               A PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS, however, 
               that Norville's arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness.

               Mussburger's legs are gone.

               Norville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely -- 
               but CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville is merely 
               pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board 
               members, including Mussburger. They stand around Mussburger's 
               office, laughing gaily. All safe now, no harm done. This 
               inaugurates:

               LAUGHING MONTAGE

               Montage silent but for MUSIC.

               A) Norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of 
               the near-disaster. Mussburger is slapping him merrily on the 
               back.

               B) CLOSE SHOT - Board member laughing.

               C) Another board member. Laughing.

               D) Mussburger. Laughing.

               E) Norville laughing.

               F) FREEZE FRAME ON Norville's laughing face.

               ANGLE

               PULL BACK to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper 
               photo on the front page of the Manhattan Argus.

               Its headline reads: UNTRIED YOUTH TO HELM HUDSUCKER.

               The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary. The sub-subhead reads: 
               Meteoric Rise From Mailroom.

               The article is under the byline of Amy Archer.

               CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that we are looking at the 
               newspaper OVER someone's SHOULDER. The person swivels around 
               and away -- his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville 
               looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs 
               merrily.

               As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto 
               his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK 
               REVEALS that he is in a barber chair.

               His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair 
               is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning --

               -- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again.

               Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a 
               slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade.

               FREEZE ON Norville's laughing face.

               ANGLE

               PULL BACK to reveal it is another front page photo next to 
               the headline: Hud Board To Street: GIVE MAN FROM MUNCIE A 
               CHANCE. Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas.

               CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a 
               chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to 
               cover it.

               PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a 
               tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes 
               his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts, 
               hose stockings and garters.

               The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and 
               spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape.

               Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.

               BOARD MEMBER

               laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching 
               between his hands. He joyously tosses away the tickertape.

               FLOOR

               where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged 
               tape.

               PAN UP to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its 
               disastrous tale of good news for the board.

               PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's 
               office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk, 
               Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper.

               TRACK IN TOWARDS him.

               On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his 
               window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles 
               by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails.

               As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN 
               shows its front page headline: HUD STOCK DIPS. Subhead: Just 
               Good Is He?

               TRACK IN ON the front page photo: Norville laughing, his 
               chin propped in his hand.

               PHOTOGRAPH

               COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing.

               We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak 
               desk, newly coifed and tailored.

               The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE 
               OF THE PRESIDENT.

               TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office, leaving 
               Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT.

               His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office.

               Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him 
               exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several 
               days. He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY

               In the skyline we can see the Hudsucker building topped by 
               the Hudsucker clock.

               A cigar ENTERS FRAME in the f.g., then the face of the man 
               smoking it. Staring contemplatively at the Hudsucker building, 
               he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his 
               mouth and waves it, as if painting a headline.

               REVERSE

               shows the Editors glassed-in office filled with REPORTERS 
               for the staff meeting. Although they listen quietly, they 
               are more bored than attentive.

               THROUGH the glass walls we can see the furious activity of 
               an army of reporters, editors, and copy boys waging the never-
               ending battle to put out a quality daily newspaper.

               The Editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust.

                                     EDITOR
                         Facts, figures, charts! They never 
                         sold a newspaper! I read this 
                         morning's edition of the Argus and 
                         let me tell you something: I'd wrap 
                         a fish in it!  I'd use it as kindling! 
                         Hell, I'd even train my poodle with 
                         it if he wasn't a French poodle and 
                         more partial to the pages of Paree 
                         Soir! But I sure wouldn't shell out 
                         a hard-earned nickel to read the 
                         dadblamed thing!

                         coconut to drop, file a story on it -- 
                         it'll be more of a grabber than your 
                         piece on the commie grain surplus! 
                         The human angle! That's what sells 
                         papers! We need a front page with 
                         heart and the whole idea of the 'Idea 
                         Man' idea can put it there!

                         Chief, if we had more access --

                                     EDITOR
                         Yeah, and if a frog had wings he 
                         wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I 
                         don't want excuses, I want results!

               Whack! --

               Without even looking in its direction, the Editor has slammed 
               down the lid of the cigar box on his desk, towards which one 
               Reporter's hand had been idly reaching.

               The Reporter jerks his fingers away as the Editor spares the 
               briefest moment to glare at him.

                                     EDITOR
                         I wanna know what makes the Idea Man 
                         tick! Where is he from? Where is he 
                         going? I wanna know everything about 
                         this guy! Has he got a girl? Has he

                         Still waters run deep, chief.

                                     EDITOR
                         The only thing that runs deep with 
                         Parkinson is the holes in his ears.
                         Yes, the Idea Man! What're his hopes 
                         and dreams, his desires and 
                         aspirations? Does he think all the 
                         time or does he set aside a certain 
                         portion of the day? How tall is he 
                         and what's his shoe size? Where does 
                         he sleep and what does he eat for 
                         breakfast? Does he put jam on his 
                         toast or doesn't he put jam on his 
                         toast, and if not why not and since 
                         when?

               He thrust his face into that of the Reporter.

                                     EDITOR
                         ...Well?!!

               WOMAN

               Star reporter AMY ARCHER -- attractive, smartly-dressed.

                                     AMY
                         I tell ya the guy's a phony.

                                     EDITOR
                         Phony, huh?

                                     AMY
                         As a three-dollar bill.

                                     EDITOR
                         Sez who?

                                     AMY
                         Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an 
                         Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says 
                         he is? What're his ideas? Why won't 
                         they let anyone interview him?...

               One Reporter is leaning into another to keep his voice low:

                                     REPORTER
                         Five bucks says she mentions her

                         ...And just take a look at the mug 
                         on this guy -- the jutting eyebrows, 
                         the simian forehead, the idiotic 
                         grin. Why he has a face only a mother 
                         could love --

               Whack! The Editor has slammed down the cigar box lid again 
               but: Amy, smiling, raises a cigar INTO FRAME having beaten 
               him.

               She tosses it to the Reporter who failed to get one.

                                     AMY
                         ...On payday! The only story here is

                         editor of this rag. Amy, I thought 
                         you were doing that piece on the 
                         F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will 
                         He Marry?

                                     AMY

                         or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums 
                         get up off your brains and get me

                         Al, he's the bunk.

               Slam!

               One of the wagering Reporters grins at the other, who is 
               taking out a five dollar bill.

               The door bursts open and Amy sticks her head in.

                                     AMY

               ELEVATOR DOORS

               Sweeping open to reveal the leering face of Buzz, the elevator 
               gnat.

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, buddy! Where'd ya get the new 
                         duds?

               Norville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...and say, buddy! How'd old 
                         bucketbutt like his blue letter?
                         Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut? 
                         Did he die? Did he -- Well, hello, 
                         Mr. Mussburger, sir...

               Buzz is instant decorum as Mussburger enters the elevator.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...How're you this fine morning, 
                         sir?

               Norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the 
               mention of the blue letter.

                                     NORVILLE
                         That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. 
                         I never did give you that--

                                     MUSSBURGER
                              (to Buzz)
                         Lobby. We haven't got all day.

                         Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.

               As he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a 
               cigar, inspects it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Well I'm starved. I understand it'll 
                         be quite an affair this afternoon, 
                         and the executive roast tom turkey 
                         at the Bohemian Grove redefines the 
                         word superb.

               He puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there 
               with a lighter.

                                     BUZZ
                         My pleasure, sir.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry 
                         too --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure...

               The elevator doors open.

                                     BUZZ
                         It's been a pleasure serving you, 
                         Mr. Mussburger.

               Buzz turns to Norville. He is puzzled but trying to hide it:

                                     BUZZ
                         ...and it's been a pleasure serving 
                         you too, uh... buddy.

               MR. MUSSBURGER

               is already striding through the lobby; Norville has to lope 
               to catch up.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't 
                         we be a little bit concerned with 
                         the downward spiral of our stock 
                         these last few days? I mean, you're 
                         the expert, but at the Muncie College 
                         of Business Administration they told 
                         us --

               Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps 
               Norville on the shoulder.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Relax, Norville. It's only natural 
                         in a period of transition for the 
                         more nervous element to run for cover.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the 
                         expert, but --

               EXT. SIDEWALK

               Norville is still loping behind Mussburger, trying to keep 
               up with his long strides.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You don't happen to remember the 
                         plan I outlined to you the day I set 
                         fire to your off -- uh, the day I 
                         was promoted?

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         I do remember and I was impressed.
                         Anyway, that's all forgotten now. 
                         Driver!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Thank you, Sid, but the reason I 
                         mention it is, it would require such 
                         a small capital investment -- again, 
                         you're the expert here --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Damnit, where's my car!

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- But there's such an enormous 
                         potential profit-wise given the 
                         demographics -- baby boom --
                         discretionary income in the burgeoning 
                         middle class --

               A black limousine pulls up to the curb.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Finally.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- So if you think it's appropriate, 
                         I'd like to bounce the idea off a 
                         few people at lunch --

               Mussburger is getting into the back seat --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure, tell whoever you want...

               And, to Norville's surprise, slamming the door shut behind 
               him.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...And I'd like to hear more about 
                         it at some point, too.

               SCREEEECH -- the CAR pulls away. Norville is left talking to 
               himself on the empty sidewalk.

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, Sid, I thought you and I were...

                                     DOORMAN
                         Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk 
                         clear here?

                                     NORVILLE
                         But I'm the president of this -- 
                         aww, forget it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COFFEE SHOP

               A cheap coffee shop a half-flight down from the street.

               We are LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the coffee shop counter. 
               In the middle b.g., Norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup 
               of coffee.

               Behind him, THROUGH the window wells, we see the back and 
               forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk.

               In the extreme f.g. sit two steaming mugs of coffee.

               They belong to two VETERANS of the coffee shop, who, from 
               O.S., narrate the scene.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         I got gas, Bennie.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Yeah, tell me about it.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Ya get the special?

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Fah from it...

               He gives a low whistle under his breath as a woman enters 
               from the street and hesitates by the door, looking around. 
               Still attractive but looking somewhat down-at-the-heels, it 
               is Amy Archer.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         ...Enter the dame.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         There's one in every story.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Ten bucks says she's looking for a 
                         handout.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Twenty bucks says not here she don't 
                         find one.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She's looking for her mark.

               The woman's eyes settle on Norville, and she heads for the 
               empty stool next to his.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         She finds him.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She sits down.

               The woman says something to the counter waitress, who exits.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...and awduhs a light lunch.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She looks in her purse...

               She is holding her wallet upside down.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...No money.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         The mark notices.

               Beat. Norville, however, is not noticing: He is staring 
               intently at his coffee spoon, his hat pushed back on his 
               head, his other hand propping up a cheekbone; the woman's 
               presence does not seem to have registered yet.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...He's not noticing, Benny.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Maybe he's wise.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         He don't look wise.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Plan two: Here come the waterworks.

               The woman starts crying.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Yellowstone.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Old Faithful.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Hello, Niagara.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         He notices.

               As the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles 
               Norville and he finally does indeed notice.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         He's concerned.

               The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically 
               and waves his hands at the waitress.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She explains her perdicament, and...

                                     VETERAN #1 & #2 (O.S.)
                              (in unison)
                         ...entuh the light lunch.

               The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman.

               The woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at 
               him.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         She's got other problems, of course...

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         ...Her mother needs an operation...

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         ...adenoids.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         No, Bennie: Lumbago.

               Veteran #1's enunciation of "lumbago" falls into perfect 
               sync with the woman's moving lips.

               Norville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices 
               his watch.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                              (alarmed)
                         She's losing him, Bennie.

               Norville is rising to his feet.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Maybe he's wise.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         He don't look wise.

               As Norville turns to leave:

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         How does she pull this out?

               She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                              (disbelieving)
                         She isn't!

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                              (thrilled)
                         She is!

               And indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on 
               the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her.

               Norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help.

                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
                         She's good, Bennie.

                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
                         She's damn good, Lou.

               A WAITRESS enters extreme f.g. to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the 
               swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville. The Waitress is 
               FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING 
               gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she 
               holds.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (bored, nasal voice)
                         Can I get you boys anything else?

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond 
               her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They 
               sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps.

                                     VETERAN #1
                         Bromo.

               Beat.

                                     VETERAN #2
                         ...Bromo.

               INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just 
               finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President.

               The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow 
               approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he 
               is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, 
               cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the 
               doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against 
               the door and get the knob with his other hand.

               The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is 
               wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode.

               He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the 
               lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, 
               in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN 
               tnediserP.

               Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:

                                     AMY
                         I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. 
                         It was just that horrible little 
                         elevator boy...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Not at all. You're light as a feather.

                                     AMY
                              (pointing languorously)
                         The couch, please.

               Still wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch 
               and deposits her gently on it. He straightens up and looks 
               at her.

               NORVILLE'S POV

               She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES 
               as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs.

               We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside 
               his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as 
               if coming from a long way away.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     NORVILLE
                         Just a minute.

               He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his 
               head between his knees, still fighting for breath.

                                     AMY
                         I don't know what came over me. I 
                         suppose it was the shock of eating 
                         after so long without; the enzymes 
                         kicking in after so long, or whatever. 
                         But then you couldn't possibly know 
                         what it is to be tired and hungry...

               Speaking into his knees as he wheezes:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hungry, anyway.

                                     AMY
                         I don't want to bore you with all 
                         the sordid details of my life; it's 
                         not a happy story...

               Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her 
               head.

                                     AMY
                         ...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless -- 
                         though not for want of trying, that 
                         I'm friendless, with no one to -- 
                         thank you -- take care of me; and 
                         that had you not come along at just 
                         exactly the moment that you did --

               She screams, staring down at the couch.

               Norville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking.

               On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is 
               printed, in wet ink, right side around: NORVILLE BARNES, 
               President.

                                     AMY
                         Norville, I didn't know you were 
                         president here!

               Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion. When the 
               nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the 
               seat of his pants.

               Distracted but still modest:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, it's nothing really. Just 
                         determination and hard work...

               He unbuckles his trousers.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Of course, when I started in the 
                         mailroom last Tuesday I thought it 
                         might take more time --

               Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag.

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you 
                         asked f --

               He freezes, taking in the scene: Amy reclining on the couch; 
               Norville standing in front of her with his pants around his 
               ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in 
               his own hand.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (flustered)
                         Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on 
                         the desk.

               Leering:

                                     BUZZ
                         Happy days, buddy...

               As he turns to leave:

                                     BUZZ
                         ...and I'll tell your secretary you're 
                         not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!!

               He snaps the elastic strap under his chin.

               After the doors shut behind Buzz:

                                     AMY
                              (shuddering)
                         What a horrible little person.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --

                                     AMY
                         At any rate I arrived in town not 
                         ten days ago, full of dreams and 
                         aspirations, anxious to make my way 
                         in the world --

               Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her.

                                     AMY
                         A little naive perhaps but -- thank 
                         you -- armed with determination, a 
                         solid work ethic, and an indomitable 
                         belief in the future --

                                     NORVILLE
                         I myself --

               He crosses back to the desk.

                                     AMY
                         Only to have that belief, that 
                         unsullied optimism, dashed against 
                         the marble and mortar of the modern 
                         work place --

               Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box 
               on the desk and sticks it in his mouth.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Cigarette?

                                     AMY
                         No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, 
                         work and ye shall prosper -- these 
                         were the watch words of my education, 
                         the ethics of my tender years --

               OVER NORVILLE'S SHOULDER

               He has been pushing the box towards her. The box tilts lazily 
               forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk. We 
               hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the pitter-patter of 
               cigarettes raining onto the carpet.

               Amy's brow crinkles. Continuing:

                                     AMY
                         -- these were the values that were 
                         instilled in me while I was growing 
                         up in a little town you've probably 
                         never heard of --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Mind if I join you?

               He is pouring himself a drink.

                                     AMY
                         Be my guest. A little town you've 
                         probably --

               He tosses back his drink, gags, looks at Amy with his eyes 
               bulging.

               HIS POV

               Once again her IMAGE PULSATES. There is a ROARING SOUND and 
               an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips.

                                     NORVILLE
                         He waves his arms and talks with a 
                         thick rasp as he staggers to his 
                         feet.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Excuse me -- I -- executive 
                         washroom...

               He staggers out a side door.

               On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his 
               desk. At the top of her voice:

                                     AMY
                         Are you all right?...

               She throws open the top desk drawer. Inside two lonely lead 
               pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer.

               Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a 
               match off the desktop.

                                     AMY
                         ...Is it your lunch? The chicken a 
                         la king?

               From the washroom:

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         No, I --

               Amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an 
               appointment book. As she hurriedly flips through page after 
               blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness. One page only 
               has a notation: 11:45. Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior 
               Achievers Club.

                                     AMY
                         Is the a la king repeating on you?

               Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         ...I'm fine, I... You were saying?

               She mutters:

                                     AMY
                         Values... watchwords... uh, tender 
                         years...
                              (aloud)
                         -- A little town you've probably 
                         never heard of...

               She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to 
               disperse the smoke.

                                     AMY
                         ...Muncie, Indiana.

               She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET BEING 
               TURNED OFF: she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch 
               just as the washroom door opens.

               Norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his 
               forehead.

                                     NORVILLE
                         You're from Muncie?!

                                     AMY
                         Why yes, do you know it?

               Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and 
               loud syncopated grunting noises. Amy gapes at him.

               He starts singing, off-key:

                                     NORVILLE
                         'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie 
                         Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue 
                         You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin'
                         Once 'The Munce' is done with you!'

               Amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last, 
               obvious rhyme. Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly 
               follows sit, also pumping her fists.

               As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of 
               his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Goooooooo Eagles!

               Amy awkwardly imitates.

               Norville excitedly sits behind his desk.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...A Muncie girl! Talk about the 
                         cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy.
                         I'm gonna cancel the rest of my 
                         appointments this afternoon and get 
                         you a job here at the Hud.

                                     AMY
                         Oh, no, really, I --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Don't bother to thank me, it's the 
                         easiest thing in the world. Matter 
                         of fact, I know where a vacancy just 
                         came up.

               He hits the intercom.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Mail room.

               To Amy:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...This'll only take a moment.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville

                         And where's my voucher?!

               Norville thumps at his pockets.

                                     NORVILLE

                         I need that voucher! I told you a 
                         week ago it was important!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But look, I'm president of the company 
                         now and I --

                         I don't care if you're president of

                         Now!

               CLICK. The intercom goes dead.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do 
                         you take shorthand? Are you familiar 
                         with the mimeograph machine?

                                     AMY
                         Of course -- I went to the Muncie, 
                         uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!

               Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!

                                     AMY
                         Well, I just don't know how to thank 
                         you, Mr. Barnes --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Please! Norville!

               As he reaches to shake:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...It's my pleasure!

               She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away and, 
               winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes 
               wings of his fingers.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Gooooooo Eagles!

               AMY

               likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings, 
               and, winking back:

                                     AMY
                         Gooooooooo Eagles!

               But we PULL BACK to reveal that the girl is now in a newspaper 
               office, demonstrating the fight sign to SMITTY, a reporter 
               wearing a fedora with a bent-back brim. Smitty howls with 
               laughter.

                                     SMITTY
                              (wheezing)
                         ...Once 'The Munce'... Holy...

               Amy sits down behind a typewriter and, as she starts typing 
               at 80 words per minute:

                                     AMY
                         And is this guy from chumpsville?!
                         I pulled the old mother routine --

                                     SMITTY
                         Adenoids?

                                     AMY
                         Lumbago.

               Behind her an ancient man wearing an inksman's visor and 
               sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface 
               over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces.

               Smitty gives a low whistle.

                                     SMITTY
                         That gag's got whiskers on it!

               The PHONE RINGS and Smitty reaches for it.

                                     AMY
                         I'm telling you, Smitty, the board 
                         of Hudsucker is up to something --

                                     SMITTY
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah.

                                     ANCIENT PUZZLER
                         Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word 
                         for an affliction of the hypothalmus?

               Without a break in her typing:

                                     AMY
                         -- And it's a cinch -- Goiter -- 
                         it's a cinch this guy isn't in on 
                         it. How much time to make the Late 
                         Final?

               Smitty holds the phone away from his ear.

                                     SMITTY
                         Chief.

               Still typing, Amy whistles and nods to her shoulder.

               Smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing.

                                     AMY
                         Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted 
                         to apologize to...

               Smitty is looking at his watch.

                                     SMITTY
                         About seven minutes.

                                     AMY
                              (still typing)
                         Yeah, I was all wet about your idea 
                         man... Well, thanks for being so

               Back into phone:

                         -- as pure a specimen as I've ever

                         make me an expert then my name isn't 
                         Amy Archer and I've never won the

                         Amy, what's a three-letter word for 
                         a flightless bird?

                                     AMY
                         Not now, Morris, I'm busy -- That's 
                         right, I said hammerhead, as in a 
                         ten-letter word for a smug bullying 
                         self-important newspaperman --

                         -- or emu.

               She slams down the phone. To Smitty:

                                     AMY
                         ...And that's just the potatoes, 
                         Smitty, here comes the gravy: The 
                         chump really likes me. A Muncie girl!

               Smitty bursts out laughing.

                                     SMITTY
                         Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

               As she continues to type:

                                     AMY
                         I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the 
                         patsy and I'm gonna find out what 
                         for. There's a real story, Smitty, 
                         some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, 
                         a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!

                                     SMITTY
                         He didn't offer you money.

                                     AMY
                         A sawbuck!

                         On Norville Barnes!

               She rips the page out of the typewriter, swivels in her chair 
               to FACE CAMERA as we TRACK IN CLOSE and she hollers:

                                     AMY
                         ...Copy!

                                                       DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

               PRESSES

               rolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint.

               Papers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very 
               quickly.

               DELIVERY MAN

               throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck.

               BALED PAPER

               rolling into the f.g. A hand ENTERS FRAME to snip its wires 
               and wipe off the top paper.

               PAPER BOY

               wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap, mouthing "Extra! 
               Extra!" as he holds one of the papers aloft.

               PAN UP his arm TO the newspaper and, BEYOND it, the towering 
               Hudsucker Building.

               All of the above --

                                                           DISSOLVING WITH:

               NEWSPAPER

               spinning TOWARDS the CAMERA and STOPPING FULL FRAME.

               Its headline, over a picture of Norville smiling, is "IMBECILE 
               HEADS HUDSUCKER." The subheadline: "Not a Brain in his Head."

               ANOTHER ANGLE - NEWSPAPER

               is angrily slammed down to reveal that Norville has been 
               reading the inside.

               His face twisting with fury, he leans forward and hits the 
               intercom.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Miss Smith, can you come in please 
                         to take a letter...

               Muttering to himself:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...of all the cockamamie...

               Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil.

               As she seats herself in front of his desk, he rises to pace 
               behind it.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Did you happen to see the front 
                         page of today's Manhattan Argus?

                                     AMY
                         Well, I... didn't bother to read the 
                         article. I didn't think the picture 
                         did you justice.

                                     NORVILLE
                         The picture was fine! It's what that 
                         knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! 
                         Of all the irresponsible... Amy, 
                         take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I 
                         call you 'Miss' because you seem to 
                         have 'missed' the boat completely on 
                         this one! How on earth would you 
                         know whether I'm an imbecile when 
                         you don't even have the guts to come 
                         in here and interview me man to man! 
                         No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, 
                         make it 'common decency.' These wild 
                         speculations about my intelligence --

                                     AMY
                         -- or lack thereof?

                                     NORVILLE
                              (nodding)
                         -- these preposterous inventions, 
                         would be better suited to the pages 
                         of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the 
                         editors of the Manhattan Argus see 
                         fit to publish the rantings of a 
                         disordered mind, perhaps they will 
                         see fit to publish this letter! But 
                         I doubt it. I most seriously doubt 
                         it. As I doubt also that you could 
                         find a home at Amazing Tales, a 
                         periodical which I have enjoyed for 
                         many years. Yours sincerely, et 
                         cetera.

               He drifts into thought.

                                     AMY
                         Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

                         ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least 
                         better than that that dame does. Do 
                         you think I'm an imbecile?

                                     AMY
                         I'm sure I --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Go on, tell the truth; I trust you 
                         and I put a lot of stock in your 
                         opinion.

                                     AMY
                         Well, I --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a 
                         fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile 
                         come up with this?

               He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an 
               easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle 
               rendered onto it.

               Amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly 
               beaming face.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...I designed it myself and this is 
                         just the sweet baby that can put 
                         Hudsucker right back on top.

               Amy is bewildered. Norville explains:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You know! For kids!

                                     AMY
                         ...Why don't I just type this up...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be 
                         necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's 
                         just doing her job, I guess.

                                     AMY
                         Well, I don't know; maybe she does 
                         deserve it. Maybe she should've come 
                         in to face you man to man.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, she probably had a deadline...

                                     AMY
                         Sure, but -- she could still have 
                         gotten your side for the record!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, it's done now -- what's the 
                         use of grousing about it. Forget the 
                         letter, Amy, I just had to blow off 
                         some steam...

               She gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when 
               Norville adds:

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...She's probably just a little 
                         confused.

               Amy turns at the door.

                                     AMY
                         Confused?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yeah, you know, probably one of these 
                         fast-talking career gals, thinks 
                         she's one of the boys. Probably is 
                         one of the boys, if you know what I 
                         mean.

                                     AMY
                              (through clenched 
                              teeth)
                         I'm quite sure I don't know what you 
                         mean.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of 
                         these complexes they have nowadays. 
                         Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? 
                         She's probably very unattractive and 
                         bitter about it.

                                     AMY
                         Oh, is that it!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in 
                         men's clothing, swaps drinks with 
                         the guys at the local watering hole, 
                         and hobnobs with some smooth talking 
                         heel in the newsroom named Biff or 
                         Smoocher or...

                                     AMY
                         Smitty.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Exactly. And I bet she's ugly.
                         Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't 
                         they print her picture next to her 
                         byline?

                                     AMY
                         Maybe she puts her work ahead of her 
                         personal appearance.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I bet that's exactly what she tells 
                         herself! But you and I both know 
                         she's just a dried-up bitter old 
                         maid. Say, how about you and I grab 
                         a little dinner and a show after 
                         work? I was thinking maybe The King 
                         and I --

               Whap! Amy slaps him.

               He stares.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...How about Oklahoma?

               As she stalks out of the office:

                                     AMY
                         Norville Barnes, you don't know a 
                         thing about that woman! You don't 
                         know who she really is! And only a 
                         numbskull thinks he knows things 
                         about things he knows nothing about!

               He stares, rubbing his cheek.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Say, what gives?

               WHISTLE

               SHRIEKING.

                                                              SWISH PAN TO:

               CLOCK

               Reading five o'clock.

                                                              SWISH PAN TO:

               WORKERS

               Rising from their desks, collecting personal effects, putting 
               on their hats and coats.

               TIME CLOCK

               Busy hands punch out.

               INT. EMPTY HALLWAY

               Of the executive floor. A security man walks down the hall, 
               whistling, swinging a ring of keys. After he passes the door 
               to the ladies' room it opens, Amy peeks out, emerges, goes 
               into Norville's office.

               INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               She goes to the desk, takes out the appointment book, flips 
               through it.

               BOOK

               Still empty except for the one date with the Wilkie Grammer 
               School Junior Achievers Club, which now has a red line drawn 
               across it with the notation CANCELED.

               AMY

               looks around the office -- notices something.

               DOOR

               Set into the wall to one side it is topped by a small plaque: 
               AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

               Amy tries the knob, which turns, and enters.

               INT. ROOM

               It is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral 
               staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the 
               gloom above. It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs, 
               gears. There is no window, but on what would be the window 
               wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping 
               an interior circle. It is the backside of the great Hudsucker 
               clock.

               Amy gazes about. She crosses to a door opposite the one she 
               entered from.

               She stoops to peek through its keyhole.

               HER POV

               We are LOOKING INTO Sidney J. Mussburger's office.

               Mussburger sits at his desk barking into a Dictaphone.

               CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS on his desk 
               are going full-tilt; THRUMMMMMMM -- the CLOCK'S exterior 
               second hand sweeps a shadow across the office.

               Mussburger, it seems, never sleeps.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Watchoo doin' down they, Miss Archuh?

                                     AMY
                         Huh?!

               She straightens and turns.

               Facing her is a very old BLACK MAN in a janitor's jumpsuit 
               with HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES/The Future Is Now emblazoned across 
               it. We might recognize his voice as that of the narrator who 
               opened the movie.

                                     AMY
                         Who are you? How did you know who I 
                         am?

                                     MOSES (BLACK MAN)
                         Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about 
                         ever'thing, leastways if it concerns 
                         Hudsuckuh.

                                     AMY
                         But -- who are you -- what d'you do 
                         here?

                                     MOSES
                         Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- 
                         this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. 
                         Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- 
                         it drives that ol' global economy 
                         and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' 
                         on 'roun'. Ya see, without that 
                         capital fo'mation --

                                     AMY
                         Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone 
                         about me, will you?

                                     MOSES
                         I don't tell no one nothin' lessen 
                         they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' 
                         way.

                                     AMY
                         So if you know everything about 
                         Hudsucker, tell me why the Board 
                         decided to make Norville Barnes 
                         president.

                                     MOSES
                         Well, that even surprised ole Moses 
                         at fust. I didn't think the Board 
                         was that smart.

                                     AMY
                         That smart?!

                                     MOSES
                         But then I figured it out: they did 
                         it 'cause they figured young Norville 
                         for an imbecile. Like some othuh 
                         people ah know.

                                     AMY
                         Why on earth would they want a nitwit 
                         to be president?

                                     MOSES
                         'Cause they's little pigglies!
                         They's tryin' to inspire panic, make 
                         that stock git cheap so's they can 
                         snitch it all up fo' themselves! But 
                         Norville, he's got some tricks up 
                         his sleeve, he does...

               He draws a circle with his finger in the air.

                                     MOSES
                         ...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a 
                         smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, 
                         he's a caution. Wal, some folks is 
                         square, an' some is hip --

               To punctuate, he gives a little jerk of his hips.

                         ...But I guess you don't really know 
                         him any better than that board does, 
                         do ya, Miss Archuh?

                         Well, maybe I --

                         An' only some kind a knucklehead 
                         thinks she knows things 'bout things 
                         she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- 
                         How'd that go?

                         Why you don't even know y'own self --

                         Well, in connection with my job,

                         it were --

                         I don't mean that! Why you pretendin'

                         never gonna make you happy! Never

               Elsewhere in the great room, he is hunkered down next to a 
               catchment which he buffs with a greasy rag. Amy's VOICE ECHOES 
               UP:

                         heartache ol' Warin' had. But then,

               He slams down a typescript.

                                     CHIEF
                         I can't print this!

                         Why not, it's all true! The board is 
                         using this poor guy! They're 
                         depressing the stock so they can buy 
                         it cheap!

                                     CHIEF
                         It's pure speculation! Why, they'd 
                         have my butt in a satchel!

                         You don't know anything! Fact is 
                         they haven't bought it! The stock is 
                         cheap, Archer! What're they waiting 
                         for?

                         Amy's hunches are usually pretty 
                         good, Chief.

                                     CHIEF
                         You don't accuse someone of stock 
                         manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz!

                         aren't interested in sensationalism, 
                         gossip and unsupported speculation. 
                         Facts, figures -- those are the tools 
                         of the newspaper trade! Why it's 
                         almost as if you're trying to take 
                         the heat off this Barnes numbskull -- 
                         like you've gone all soft on him!

                         Come on, Chief, that's a low blow.
                         Archer's not gonna go goey for a 
                         corn-fed idiot.

                                     CHIEF
                         All right, I was out of line. But 
                         you're out of line with this stock 
                         swindle story. Gimme some more of

                         Easy, Amy...

               He gives her a companionable goose.

                                     SMITTY
                         ...Let's grab a highball and calm

                         Back off -- smoocher!

               Smitty rubs his cheek, staring as she storms off.

               ENGRAVED INVITATION

               IT READS:

               Sidney J. Mussburger President Norville Barnes and The Board 
               of Hudsucker Industries CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO The Annual 
               Fancy-Dress Hudsucker Christmas Gala Music, Dancing, 
               Refreshments (Dainties) Formal Evening Attire de Rigeuer. 

               The MUSIC OVER the invitation -- "WE WISH YOU A MERRY 
               CHRISTMAS" -- SEGUES INTO the dance music of the Hudsucker 
               Chamber Orchestra.

               DANCING COUPLES

               FILL the SCREEN; we GLIDE AMONG them and FINALLY COME to 
               follow one couple: Norville and MRS. MUSSBURGER, a large 
               middle-aged woman of the Margaret Dumont-mold in an 
               elaborately flowered and old-fashioned evening gown, low-cut 
               in spite of her overly-heavy figure. She wears a large 
               flowered hat with a rolled-up veil.

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         -- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons 
                         and the garden was in positive ruins!

                                     NORVILLE
                         That must have been quite a 
                         disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I 
                         was in bed for a week! Positively 
                         sick with fury! I called in the 
                         gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, 
                         either those azaleas come up next 
                         spring or you are terminee!

               She throws her head back and roars with laughter.

               ANGLE - THEIR FEET

               As the large woman leans back to laugh, her feet stay planted 
               on the ground and Norville's rise to be dragged with his 
               toes scraping the floor through the continuing dance.

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         I'm brushing up on my French with 
                         the most charming man, Pierre of 
                         Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I haven't had --

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         Sidney and I are planning a trip to 
                         Paris and points continental --
                         Aren't we, dear?

               Mussburger has ENTERED FRAME.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure. I'm going to borrow 
                         Norville for a while, if you don't 
                         mind, dear.

               MIXING DOWN as they leave her:

                                     MRS. MUSSBURGER
                         Well, frankly, I...

                                     NORVILLE
                         You have a charming wife, Mr.
                         Muss -- uh, Sid.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         So they tell me. Norville, let me 
                         shepherd you through some of the 
                         introductions here. Try not to talk 
                         too much; some of our biggest 
                         stockholders are, uh -- scratch that: 
                         Say whatever you want.

               ENTRYWAY

               As Amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown. She 
               looks around the room, then starts across the crowded floor 
               towards the punch bowl.

               NORVILLE

               As Mussburger introduces him to a tall, imposing BUSINESSMAN 
               in a tuxedo and a ten-gallon hat.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce 
                         Mr. Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker 
                         Industries largest and most loyal 
                         stockholders.

               Ignoring Norville's proffered hand:

                                     CARDOZO (BUSINESSMAN)
                         Dammit boy, what's this I hear about 
                         you bein' an embecile? What the hell 
                         is ailin' ya?! A week ago my stock 
                         was worth twice what it is now! I'm 
                         considering dumping the whole shootin' 
                         match, unless I see some vast 
                         improvement! Dammit, boy, It's a 
                         range war! Either you pull our wagons 
                         into a circle or I'm pullin' out of 
                         the wagon train!

               Norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No need for concern, sir; it's only 
                         natural in a period of transition 
                         for the more timid element to run 
                         for cover --

                                     CARDOZO
                         So I'm yella, am I?!!

               He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket:

                                     CARDOZO
                         ...We'll see who's yella!!

               His WIFE, a small wiry woman, steps in as Mussburger starts 
               dragging Norville away.

                                     MRS. CARDOZO
                         Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein' 
                         sech an ole grizzly.

               As he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket:

                                     CARDOZO
                         Aww, I wasn't gonna hurt the boy, 
                         Lorelei...

               MUSSBURGER AND NORVILLE

               As they make their way through the room Norville is mopping 
               at his brow with a handkerchief.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I 
                         showed him the long view we might --

               Thump! Dabbing at his brow, Norville has walked square into 
               the back of a debonaire man holding a martini.

               The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Norville, this is Thorstensen 
                         Finlandsen, who heads a radical 
                         splinter group of disgruntled 
                         investors.

               Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen's hand.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to 
                         meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y -- 
                         uh, pleased to make your --

               Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at Norville's 
               handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently having 
               been given it during the handshake.

               He hands it back to Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Thank you, sir...

               He stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as 
               Findlandsen stares at him. Mussburger stands watching in the 
               executive at-ease, hands dug into his pockets.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...I understand your concern about 
                         the down-ward, you know, but I think 
                         you'll find under our strong new 
                         leadership...

               As Norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the 
               handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of the 
               pocket and follows his hand down.

               Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look, and 
               stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky.

               Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at 
               Norville, who continues, O.S.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         We anticipate, in short order, an 
                         upward...

               In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch -- 
               Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand 
               pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand 
               pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly 
               waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward 
               onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN.

                                     MRS. FINDLANDSEN
                         Ahhh!

               There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim:

               EMCEE

               grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the 
               band and grins.

                                     EMCEE
                         Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished 
                         members of the Hudsucker board. I 
                         give you the king of swing, the rajah 
                         of romance, the incredible, the 
                         unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta!

               Vic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs 
               away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon. He wears a white 
               dinner jacket. His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead 
               in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and 
               bounces across his forehead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SEVERAL BOARD MEMBERS

               Clustered in a dim corner of the room, smoking cigars.

               In the b.g., brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his 
               song.

               As Mussburger joins them:

                                     EXECUTIVE #1
                         How's it going, Mr. Mussburger?

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Bad.

                                     EXECUTIVE #2
                         Good.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         But not bad enough.

                                     EXECUTIVE #3
                         Too bad.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         It could be better, it could be worse.

                                     ALL THREE EXECUTIVES
                         Hmmmmmm.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         The stock's got to drop another five 
                         points if we expect to get controlling 
                         interest. Norville tells me he's got 
                         some hot idea. Can't be good.

                                     EXECUTIVE #1
                         Then it can't be bad!

                                     EXECUTIVE #2
                         Couldn't be better if it couldn't be 
                         worse.

                                     ALL
                         Hmmmmmm.

               EXT. PENTHOUSE - TERRACE

               where the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just 
               FILTERING OUT.

               We are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing 
               the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture, 
               with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand 
               pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a 
               stiff neck tossing back a drink.

               REVERSE

               Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him.

                                     AMY
                         ...Norville?

               He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a 
               dripping icepack against one eye.

                                     AMY
                         ...What happened?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh. Nothing, really, just... the 
                         more timid investors are no longer 
                         running for cover.

                                     AMY
                         Let me look.

               He does.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sid found me the icepack.

                                     AMY
                         Let me hold it, or you'll have a 
                         real shiner.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot 
                         over this imbecile story.

                                     AMY
                         ...I'm sorry.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy.
                         You're the one person who's been 
                         standing by me through all this.

               As she rolls the pack gently across his eye:

                                     AMY
                         Norville... there's something I have 
                         to tell you. You see, I'm not really 
                         a secretary.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I know that, Amy.

                                     AMY
                         ...You do?

                                     NORVILLE
                         I understand that you're not very 
                         skilled yet in the secretarial arts. 
                         I'm not that skilled as president. 
                         Oh sure, I put up a big front --
                              (massages his eye)
                         -- not that everyone's buying it.

                                     AMY
                         I believe in you, Norville --
                         At least I believe in your... 
                         intentions --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, I don't blame them, really. I 
                         guess I have sort of made a mess of 
                         things. These folks have to protect 
                         their investment. Most of them are 
                         very nice people --

                                     AMY
                         Norville, you can't trust people 
                         here like you did in Muncie...

               They gaze out at the city.

                                     AMY
                         ...Certain people are --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Didja ever go to the top of old man 
                         Larson's feed tower and look out 
                         over the town?

                                     AMY
                         ...Huh?

                                     NORVILLE
                         You know, on farm route 17.

                                     AMY
                         Oh yes! In Muncie!

                                     NORVILLE
                         No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!

                                     AMY
                         Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well 
                         no, I -- I never really... There's a 
                         place I go now, the cutest little 
                         place near my apartment in Greenwich 
                         Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's 
                         a beatnik bar.

                                     NORVILLE
                         You don't say.

                                     AMY
                         Yes, you can get carrot juice or 
                         Italian coffee, and the people there -- 
                         well, none of them quite fit in. 
                         You'd love it -- why don't you come 
                         there with me -- they're having a 
                         marathon poetry reading on New Year's 
                         Eve. I go every year.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (puzzled)
                         Every year?

                                     AMY
                         Well -- this year -- if it's good I 
                         plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my 
                         it certainly is beautiful --

               She nods out at the city to avoid Norville's quizzical look.

                                     AMY
                         ...The people look like ants.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, the Hindus say -- and the 
                         beatniks also -- that in the next 
                         life some of us will come back as 
                         ants. Some will be butterflies.
                         Others will be elephants or creatures 
                         of the sea.

                                     AMY
                         What a beautiful thought.

                                     NORVILLE
                         What do you think you were in your 
                         previous life, Amy?

                                     AMY
                         Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a 
                         fast-talking career gal who thought 
                         she was one of the boys --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so 
                         but I find that very farfetched.

                                     AMY
                         Norville, there really is something 
                         I have to tell you --

                                     NORVILLE
                         That kind of person would come back 
                         as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I 
                         think it more likely that you were a 
                         gazelle, with long, graceful legs, 
                         gamboling through the underbrush. 
                         Perhaps we met once, a chance 
                         encounter in a forest glade. I must 
                         have been an antelope or an ibex. 
                         What times we must have had -- 
                         foraging together for sustenance, 
                         picking the grubs and burrs from one 
                         another's coats. Or perhaps we simply 
                         touched our horns briefly and went 
                         our separate ways...

                         I wish it were that simple, Norville. 
                         I wish I was still a gazelle, and 
                         you were an antelope or an ibex.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, can I at least call you deer? 
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the 
                         whole thing is what your beatnik 
                         friends call 'karma' -- the great 
                         circle of life, death and rebirth.

               Morosely:

                                     AMY
                         Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
                         What goes around comes around.

                                     NORVILLE
                         That's it. A great wheel that gives 
                         us each what we deserve...

               He slaps his fist into his palm.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Tomorrow's my big presentation to 
                         the board. I've gotta show Sidney 
                         and the guys that I deserve all their 
                         confidence!

               Sadly:

                                     AMY
                         Oh, Norville --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for 
                         luck!

                                     AMY
                         Sure, Norville, sure...

               She gives him a peck. They look at each other.

                                     AMY
                         ...Oh, Norville!

               She embraces him. They kiss again.

               Norville's eyes widen.

               VIC TENETTA

               Crooning the end of his song.

               DANCING COUPLES

               Turn to the bandstand and applaud.

               NORVILLE AND AMY

               In the midst of a passionate kiss.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               DOUBLE OAK DOORS

               Labeled "Executive Conference Room." A secretary is hanging 
               up a sign that reads: "Quiet Please! Board Meeting in 
               Session."

               INT. BOARDROOM - CLOSE ON NORVILLE

               Chest and up. His upper torso is swaying, his shoulders 
               rhythmically rolling as he talks. We hear a WHOOSH WHOOSH 
               sound from O.S.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- So we have economy, simplicity, 
                         low production cost and the potential 
                         for mass appeal, and all that spells 
                         out great profitability...

               CLOSE ON MUSSBURGER

               Staring. Holding a just-lighted but forgotten cigar in one 
               hand, and a still burning match in the other.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         ...I had the boys down at R & D throw 
                         together this prototype so that our

                         focus...

               BOARD

               Staring, mouths hanging open, in arrested motion much like 
               when Waring Hudsucker jumped out the window at the previous 
               board meeting.

                                     NORVILLE (O.S.)
                         ...and to give you gentlemen of the 
                         Board a first-hand look at just how 
                         exciting this gizmo is...

               WIDER ON NORVILLE

               Still gyrating. We now see that he has accelerated the hula 
               hoop around his waist to quite a good speed.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...It's fun, it's healthy, it's good 
                         exercise; kids'll just love it, and 
                         we put a little sand inside to make 
                         the whole experience more pleasant. 
                         And the great part is we won't have 
                         to charge an arm and a leg!

               Mussburger's forgotten match has burned down to his 
               fingertips. With a wince, he shakes it out.

               The Board is staring.

               The Board looks at Mussburger.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...It's genius. It's just exactly

                         for this, uh...

               He smiles weakly at Norville.

               As furiously BUSY MUSIC STARTS:

               TELETYPE

               Furiously PRINTING out "EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE #37451-JL7.

               A hand ENTERS FRAME and rips the directive from the teletype, 
               then hurriedly rolls it into a cylinder and slips it into a 
               cylindrical metal capsule.

               The capsule is popped into a pneumatic tube.

               ANGLE - LENGTH OF PNEUMATIC PIPING

               somewhere in the labyrinthine substructure of the Hudsucker 
               Building. We hear a MISSILE furiously HURTLING towards us, 
               inside the pipe, and ROCKETING by.

               Once again we hear the CAPSULE APPROACH and ROCKET past.

               BLINDING RED LIGHTS

               as a SIREN BLARES. On a huge board that says HUDSUCKER DESIGN 
               DEPARTMENT, flashing red letters announce: INCOMING DIRECTIVE!

               The pneumatic tube spout shoots out a cylinder, and a hand 
               eagerly picks it up and yanks it OUT OF FRAME.

               A technician in white laboratory smock is reading the 
               directive as several other white-jacketed technicians crowd 
               their heads around his shoulders, also reading.

               All of their eye and head motions synchronize as they eagerly 
               read, devouring the document line by line.

               A large sheet of graph paper is whipped down on top of a 
               drafting table. Under the caption OVERHEAD ANGLE is a perfect 
               circle. Under the caption HORIZONTAL is a horizontal line. 
               Under the caption VERTICAL SIDE ANGLE is a vertical line.

               looking thoughtfully down at the rendering. The head 
               technician is stroking his beard and nodding.

               we can see the three admen working inside.

               Two pace back and forth, smoking cigarettes, as they toss 
               out ideas. The third sits slumped in front of a silhouette 
               typewriter, his head resting on one hand, his other hand 
               resting on a half-empty bottle of whiskey.

               In the f.g., outside the frosted glass and so not in 
               silhouette, sits a bored secretary reading War and Peace, 
               Volume One.

               Up on the wall of the accounting floor is an enormous 
               reproduction of the design department's rendering of the 
               hula hoop. Over the poster is an enormous banner: "WHAT WILL 
               THIS COST?"

               PAN FROM the poster TO a HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a floor full of 
               accountants sitting at their rows and rows of desks; all are 
               looking up at the wall poster as they operate their manual 
               adding machines to the same beat.

               All accountants wear identical vests, shirtsleeves, garters, 
               visors and spectacles.

               The head accountant stands in front of the room overseeing 
               their efforts. He wears a full three-piece suit, a visor and 
               a pince-nez.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Being dropped onto a desk. Its cover reads: SUMMARY OF COST 
               ANALYSIS.

               The book is opened and its pages, filled with rows of numbers, 
               are flipped to the last page where we QUICKLY PAN DOWN TO 
               the bottom line: Unit Cost... $0.59 Suggested Retail... $0.79

               Looking down at the book as the head accountant hovers over 
               his shoulder, waiting for his reaction.

               The executive grimly shakes his head.

               An artist's hand working in fast motion to render the hula 
               hoop logo: A grinning, healthy 1950s boy with a spray of 
               freckles, one fist thrown forward, the other behind, as if 
               doing an athletic frug, a hula hoop spinning with action 
               lines around his waist.

               In seconds the artist has completed the logo and now, also 
               in fast motion, he writes the slogan on either side of the 
               boy: "You know... For Kids!"

               industrial realm, reaches up to pull an enormous lever.

               The hoops are spit onto a long metal arm where they rest, 
               hanging.

               A bale of hula hoops is loaded into a Hudsucker truck to 
               complete its load. The truck door is slammed shut.

               IRON GRILL

               is thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just 
               opening for the day.

               In the window is an enormous hula hoop display, with various 
               hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama -- 
               "You know... for Kids!"

               Reflected in the display window we see crowds of people 
               scurrying by, indifferent to the display. Inside the shop we 
               see the proprietor by the cash register, his chin propped 
               glumly in his hands.

               INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               Norville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of Amy who sits 
               hunched over the ticker-tape machine, studying the emerging 
               tape. Amy finally looks up at Norville and sadly shakes her 
               head.

               BACK TO SHOP WINDOW

               Crowds still scurry indifferently by. The shopkeeper stands 
               idly in his doorway, smoking a cigarette.

               We TRACK IN ON the cardboard display. The displayed price of 
               $1.79 has been crossed out. Underneath it, inked in: "Reduced:

               INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               Norville is nervously pacing. Amy still studies the ticker-
               tape. Once again she is forced to shake her head sadly.

               BACK TO SHOP'S PRICE DISPLAY

               The old $1.59 is suddenly covered as the hand ENTERS FRAME

               ALLEY BEHIND SHOP

               where garbage and garbage cans sit waiting for collection:

               Hands appear at the back door of a shop hurling a clutch of 
               hoops towards the trash heap. One errant hoop rolls towards 
               the mouth of the alley.

               The mouth of the alley. The escaped hula hoop emerges and 
               starts rolling down the street.

               HULA HOOP

               It rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid 
               it.

               It rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a 
               circle around him, and finally wobbles to the pavement.

               The little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to 
               his hips and starts hula hooping. Somewhere a BELL is RINGING.

               INT. NEARBY SCHOOLHOUSE

               where the BELL is RINGING, the front doors fly open and 
               hundreds of schoolchildren run out, screaming, heading home, 
               but all in a dense pack.

               The screaming pack of schoolchildren round a corner and -- 
               stop short, their screams abruptly halting.

               They are staring, fascinated, at the hula-hooping youngster.

               The children are dumbfounded. It is a moment the likes of 
               which they have never dreamed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK TO NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               Norville sits slumped behind his desk, his head resting on 
               the desktop, utterly dejected.

               Suddenly the TICKER-TAPE HUMS to life and starts spitting 
               tape. Amy looks at it with mounting excitement. Finally she 
               looks breathlessly up:

                                     AMY

               Norville lifts his head from the desktop. A piece of scrap 
               paper is sticking to his cheek. Dramatic FANFARE MUSIC STARTS 
               TO SWELL.

               We HOLD ON Norville's expectant face. We HOLD. The MUSIC 
               BUILDS. We HOLD. We:

               Norville is holding one hand up to shield his eyes from the

                         company to put it together, and I'm 
                         just grateful for the opportunity --

                         there'd be such a huge response?

               A scientist with a Van Dyke beard, wearing a laboratory smock, 
               is facing the camera. Behind him we see other scientists 
               studying a hoop that has been hooked up to a gyroscopic-
               looking device that analyzes its various movements and 
               properties.

               disconcerting about his laugh -- it is harder, more 
               businesslike, colder than the dopey laugh that accompanied 
               his elevation to the presidency. Or perhaps it is only our 
               imagination, for while still some distance away from him:

                         they promoted me because they thought

                         Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. 
                         There's no point in looking back. At 
                         the time, Stilson thought dumping 
                         our position would panic the market, 
                         further depress the stock -- then 
                         we'd buy it all back, and more of 
                         course, once it got cheap --

                                     ADDISON
                         Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more 
                         valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!

               He climbs up onto the board table.

               He runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward 
               the window and:

               Thwok!

               LOOKING IN, as Addison flattens against the f.g. glass, his 
               face squushing, his outflung hands likewise.

               All stare in horror for a long silent beat.

               With the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass, 
               Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor, 
               and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree.

               Mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth.

                         So right now he and his dingus are

                         say, the higher he climbs, the harder 
                         he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a 
                         future, and in it I see shame, 
                         dishonor, ignominy and disgrace.

               Sure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin 
               ain't over yet.

               NORVILLE'S OFFICE

               A small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing 
               "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in 
               his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of 
               him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his 
               temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs.

               A French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee 
               squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a 
               stone chisel and hammer.

               A GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, 
               reading the funny papers.

               At length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, 
               batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hold it!...

               The musicians' playing dribbles away to silence.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Nobody move, nobody breathe...

               All sit frozen. You could hear a pin drop.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...An idea... is coming...

               Eyes narrowed, he gazes off into space, squinting for his 
               idea.

               CLOSE ON TAILOR'S KIT

               A straight pin is rolling across the top -- it drops off --

               EXTREME CLOSE ON FLOOR

               Where the PIN -- PING! -- hits.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Deflates. He glares at the tailor.

                                     NORVILLE
                         It's gone now.

               The musicians resume playing. Everyone else resumes work. 
               The INTERCOM BUZZES and a female voice announces:

                                     FEMALE (V.O.)
                         Miss Amy here to see you.

               Norville leans forward to hit his intercom.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Is she in the book? --

               The door bursts open and Amy storms in.

                                     AMY
                         For Pete's sake, Norville!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought 
                         she said, Mamie --

                                     AMY
                         Never mind about that...

               She shakes a piece of paper at Norville.

                                     AMY
                         ...You know what those nincompoops 
                         in the boardroom are doing?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --

                                     AMY
                         They're going to discharge eight 
                         percent of the work force here at 
                         Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone 
                         that means eighteen hundred people 
                         out of work, people with wives and 
                         children and families --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Well yes, we're pruning away some of 
                         the dead wood, but if --

                                     AMY
                         You mean you know about this?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Know about it? You think the Board 
                         would do anything like this without 
                         my authorization? No, this was my 
                         idea from the start.

                                     AMY
                         Your i --

                                     NORVILLE
                         We have to be realistic, Amy. You 
                         know things have slowed down a little 
                         here at Hudsucker --

                                     AMY
                         You're awful kind to yourself, 
                         Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've 
                         slowed down, sitting up here like a 
                         sultan, not doing a lick of work! 
                         Why you know it's ideas that are the 
                         lifeblood of industry and you haven't 
                         come up with one since the hoop and 
                         the reason's plain to see! You've 
                         forgotten what made your ideas 
                         exciting for you in the first place -- 
                         it wasn't for the fame and the wealth 
                         and the mindless adulation of -- 
                         would you get out of here?!

               This was addressed to the chamber orchestra, whose playing 
               dribbles off. They look inquisitively at Norville, then rise 
               to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office.

                                     AMY
                         ...I've been watching you, Norville 
                         Barnes, even though you've been trying 
                         to avoid me --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Aim --

                                     AMY
                         Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't 
                         noticed how you've changed. I used 
                         to think you were a swell guy -- 
                         well, to be honest I thought you 
                         were an imbecile --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Aim --

                                     AMY
                         Shutup! -- but then I figured out 
                         you were a swell guy, a little slow 
                         maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe 
                         you're not so slow, but you're not 
                         so swell either and it looks like 
                         you're an imbecile after --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Aim --

                                     AMY
                         Shutup! -- after all! You haven't 
                         talked to me for a week and now I'm 
                         going to say my piece. I've got a 
                         prediction for you, Norville Barnes: 
                         I predict that since you've decided 
                         to dedicate yourself to greed and 
                         sloth and everything bad, you're 
                         going to lose all the good things 
                         that your good ideas brought you.
                         You're going to throw them all away 
                         chasing after money and ease and the 
                         respect of a Board that wouldn't 
                         give you the time of day if you... 
                         if you...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Worked in a watch factory?

               The Goon looks up from his funnies.

                                     GOON
                         Huh-huh-huh!

                                     AMY
                              (to the Goon)
                         Shutup!
                              (to Norville)
                         Exactly! Don't you remember how you 
                         used to feel about the hoop? You 
                         told me you were gonna bring a smile 
                         to the hips of everyone in America, 
                         regardless of race, creed or color. 
                         Finally there'd be a thingamajig 
                         that would bring everyone together -- 
                         even if it kept 'em apart, spacially -- 
                         you know, for kids? Your words, 
                         Norville, not mine. I used to love 
                         Norville Barnes -- yes, love him! -- 
                         when he was just a swell kid with 
                         hot ideas who was in over his head, 
                         but now your head is too big to be 
                         in over!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Now, Amy --

                                     AMY
                         Consider this my resignation --

               Thwock -- She slaps him.

               The bodyguard is on his feet.

                                     GOON
                         Hey!!

               Crack -- Amy kicks him hard in the shin.

                                     GOON
                         ...Awooooo!

                                     AMY
                         -- Effective immediately!!

               She strides to the door, leaving Norville rubbing his cheek 
               and the Goon hopping around on one leg.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               CLOSE SHOT - PICTURE OF AMY

               PULL BACK SHOWS it to be her identification in her Hudsucker 
               personnel file.

               A hand brings INTO FRAME another picture of her -- this one 
               a newspaper clipping. She stands on a podium accepting an 
               award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets. 
               The caption says, "Amy Archer of the Manhattan Argus Receives 
               Pulitzer Prize."

               WIDER ANGLE

               We are in Mussburger's office. Mussburger is seated at his 
               desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign 
               letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just 
               put them down.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Hmmm... Thank you, Aloysius. This 
                         may be useful.

               Aloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave.

               As we TRACK IN ON the picture of Amy, we:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE UP TO:

               PERFECT WHITE

               After a beat, a woman ENTERS against the unblemished white 
               background, dressed in a flowing white dance robe, trailing 
               a long, diaphanous veil. She performs a flowingly sensuous 
               dance moderne; the MUSIC is a sensuous saxophone solo with 
               lasciviously bending blue notes.

               After the woman has been dancing for several beats Norville 
               enters, dancing after her, pursuing her. He is wearing a 
               coatless suit, his sleeves rolled up, his thin tie loosened.

               The woman dances around him, letting her diaphanous veil 
               trail sinuously around his body.

               We hear an ECHOING voice:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Buddy... Say, buddy...

               CLOSE SHOT - NORVILLE

               Sitting in his desk chair, sheened with sweat, eyes closed, 
               licking his lips.

               CLOSER NOW:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Buddy... Ya busy?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh-whuh?

               He opens his eyes and looks stuporously about.

               Buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator 
               cap.

                                     BUZZ
                         Looks like ya nodded off there, buddy! 
                         Say, ya got a minute?

               Norville clears his throat.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?

                                     BUZZ
                         I like to think so! It's this little 
                         idea I been working on!

               He turns an easel to face the desk.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Ya see, I don't intend to be an 
                         elevator boy forever! Take a look at 
                         this sweet baby!

               The easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper.

               Onto it has been rendered a top view, which is a perfect 
               circle, and a side view, which is a vertical line.

               Norville gazes stupidly at the circle.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...Ya get it, buddy? Incredibly 
                         convenient, isn't it? Ya see --

               He produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting in 
               it.

                                     BUZZ
                         -- this is how it works, it's these 
                         little ridges on the side that give 
                         it its whammy! See, ya don't have to 
                         drink like this anymore --

               He holds his head over the glass to drink from the vertical 
               straw.

                                     BUZZ
                         -- Now you can drink like this --

               He bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal.

                                     BUZZ
                         ...I call it the Buzz-Sucker, get 
                         it, buddy? -- After me! Buzz! Why, 
                         people are just dyin' for a product 
                         like this, and the great thing is we 
                         won't have to charge an arm and a --

               Norville, who has been stewing, finally barks:

                                     NORVILLE
                         Wait a minute!

               He grabs the lemonade glass, looks at it, sneering.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Why, this is worthless.

                                     BUZZ
                         Huh?! But, buddy --

               Norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up.

                                     NORVILLE
                         This is the most idiotic thing I've 
                         ever seen in my life!

                                     BUZZ
                         Yeah, but, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Nobody wants a hare-brained product 
                         like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks 
                         the creative spark, the unalloyed 
                         genius that made, uh...

               He pauses to belch.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...say, the hula hoop such a success.

                                     BUZZ
                         But, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         And what do you mean barging in here 
                         and taking up my valuable time! I've 
                         got a company to run here --

                                     BUZZ
                         But, buddy, you were --

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- I can't have every deadbeat on 
                         the Hudsucker payroll pestering me 
                         with their idiotic brainwaves!

                                     BUZZ
                         Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         An example must be made!

               Buzz looks over his shoulder, turns back to Norville.

                                     BUZZ
                         Wuddya mean, buddy?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Fired! You're fired! Is that plain 
                         enough for you, buster!

               Buzz's jaw drops. His elastic chin strap snaps under the 
               pressure.

                                     BUZZ
                         Awwww, buddy --

                                     NORVILLE
                         And don't call me buddy! Out of here! 
                         Out!

               Buzz sinks to his knees, weeping. He clutches pathetically 
               at Norville's pants legs.

                                     BUZZ
                         Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's 
                         all I got!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Get up!

                                     BUZZ
                         I understand if ya don't like the 
                         Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, 
                         I'm prayin' to ya!

                                     NORVILLE
                         We don't crawl at Hudsucker 
                         Industries! Get out of my office!
                         Leave your uniform in the locker 
                         room!

               Buzz stumbles away, still weeping.

                                     BUZZ
                         I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...

                                     NORVILLE
                         Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

               As we TRACK IN ON Norville, laughing, there is a low, 
               unearthly RUMBLE, and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO:

               FLAMES

               We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized 
               lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar.

               He is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings 
               open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little 
               cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge. 
               He has a full golf bag over his shoulder.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine 
                         at Riverdale is really murder.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Sure, sure, it's a tough course. 
                         Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought 
                         the board room would be a swell place 
                         to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're 
                         having some security problems here 
                         at the Hud.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Ya don't say.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you 
                         with it, but -- this is embarrassing, 
                         kid -- it seems to concern you 
                         directly.

                                     NORVILLE
                         How's that, Sid?

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         It's not important in itself --
                         some elevator boy you fired came to 
                         me claiming you'd stolen the idea 
                         for the, uh, the hoop dingus from 
                         him --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- 
                         maybe I was a little rough on the 
                         boy, ya see I --

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to 
                         explain to me. He's a little person. 
                         He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily 
                         it would just be a nuisance. But it 
                         seems -- well, there was a spy in 
                         the company...

               He is shoving a file towards Norville, who opens it.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Sure, sure, we tried to kill the 
                         story. But her newspaper won't play 
                         ball... Looks like her story's coming 
                         out...

               We TRACK DOWN the length of the board room table TOWARD 
               Norville, who stares horrified at the file.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...See, kid, the problem the Board'll 
                         have... you hired this woman. Kept 
                         her on, while she made a chump out 
                         of you. Serious error of judgment... 
                         I mean, business is war, kid -- ya 
                         take no prisoners, ya get no second 
                         chances. And a boner like this... 
                         I'm afraid when the Board meets, 
                         after New Year's, your position... 
                         well, it looks like you're finished... 
                         stick a fork in ya, you're done... 
                         washed up...

               We LOSE Mussburger FROM FRAME as we TIGHTEN FURTHER ON 
               Norville, Mussburger continuing off:

                                     MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
                         ...I'm sorry, kid. I understand this 
                         dolly who betrayed you, she used to 
                         be a friend of yours...

               Norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head.

                                     MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
                         ...And this elevator dope used to be 
                         a friend, too...

               Norville stares, perfectly still.

                                     MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
                         ...Well, they've got your throat 
                         pretty well slit. And when you're 
                         dead, ya stay dead. Ya don't believe 
                         me, ask Waring Hudsucker... Yeah, 
                         looks like curtains. Well, 
                         condolences, kid...

               Norville's IMAGE TURNS TO:

               BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGE OF NORVILLE

               We PULL BACK to show that it is on the front page of the 
               Manhattan Argus.

               The headline, in screaming nine-point type:

               FAKE!

               Next to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a 
               Fraud.

               Next to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator-
               operator's pillbox hat: Stole Hoop Idea from Genius Elevator 
               Jockey Clarence "Buzz" Gunderson.

                         But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville 
                         showed me his design for the whatsit 
                         the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't 
                         have invented it -- look at the man -- 
                         he's an imbecile!

                         Archer, you're a broken record. Fact 
                         is Gunderson did design it -- 
                         apparently he's some kind of prodigy --

                         longer on top of it. Why, it's the 
                         scoop of the century -- the other

                                     CHIEF
                              (gently)
                         Amy -- take a break. You've worked 
                         hard on this story -- heck, you broke 
                         it for us! But it's passed you by 
                         and Smith here has taken up the slack.

               She is near tears.

                                     AMY
                         You want slack, I'll give you slack. 
                         You're not putting me out to pasture, 
                         Al, I quit! Consider this my 
                         resignation --

               She turns to Smitty --

                                     AMY
                         -- effective immediately!

               -- and swings -- but he catches her before contact, holds 
               her by the wrist, and sneers:

                                     SMITTY
                         ...Soft.

               Amy swings her free arm to -- thwack -- blindside his other 
               cheek.

               NORVILLE

               In flickering black-and-white, he is lying on a couch that 
               has been brought into his office, gazing listlessly at a 
               bend straw, being interviewed by someone O.S. The footage is 
               rough, taking a moment to find focus; the sound is TINNY.

                                     GERMAN VOICE (V.O.)
                         Dell me vat is first zing droppensie

                                     NORVILLE (V.O.)
                              (listlessly)
                         Aww, what's the difference.

               BOARD MEMBER

               Sitting in a darkened board room, gazing off at a screen 
               that sends flickering light onto his face.

                                     GERMAN VOICE (V.O.)
                         Und ven I zpeak of authority?

                                     NORVILLE (V.O.)
                         Awww, I dunno.

               BACK TO SCREEN

                                     GERMAN VOICE (V.O.)

                                     NORVILLE (V.O.)
                         Nuthin', really.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               A shadow is thrown across the screen as a figure steps into 
               the beam. He throws the sharp silhouette of a strict Freudian 
               ANALYST: Van Dyke beard, pince-nez with chain trailing down 
               to his vest, one thumb hooked into the vest, the other hand 
               holding a cigar wreathing smoke, which he waves for emphasis.

                                     ANALYST
                         Patient dizplayed liztlessness, 
                         apathy, gloomy indifference und vas 
                         blue und mopey.

               The image on screen cuts to four inkblots. The Analyst sweeps 
               in a pointer and thwoks each image as he comments on it.

                                     ANALYST
                         ...Ven asked vut four Rhorschach

                         'Nussink much,' 'I don't know,' 'Chust 
                         a blotch,' und 'Sure beats me.'

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The image onscreen cuts to a close shot of Norville on the 
               couch, mouth listlessly agape.

                                     ANALYST
                         ...Patient shows no ambition, no get-

               Image cuts to a sine wave on a graph, the top of which is 
               labeled "Euphoria," the bottom of which is labeled "Despair," 
               and a reference line through the middle labeled "Normal." 
               There is an X on the declining side of the wave, near but 
               not yet at the bottom, which is labeled "Patient."

                                     ANALYST
                         -- zat goes from ze peak of delusional

                         So patient is...?

               He interrogatively twirls a finger 'round his temple.

                                     BROMFENBRENNER
                         Prezizely. Knots.

               As he scores each point it is illustrated on the screen behind 
               him: A patient is forced into a straitjacket by two brawny, 
               unshaven attendants; electricity arcs between two leads on a 
               wire cap being wielded by a technician; and lastly, a steel-
               barred door is slammed shut behind a stooped and broken 
               patient who is led, shuffling, away.

               Here the FILM runs out, CHATTERING, and the screen goes white.

               The projector is shut off and the lights go on.

               The board politely applauds.

               INT. BAR - CLOSE ON BARMAN

               He has a Vandyke beard and wears a cut-off sweatshirt and 
               dungarees and dark glasses, and has the phone wedged into 
               his shoulder as he tears open a large cardboard box.

                                     BARMAN
                         Yeah, just get down here -- he says 
                         he's a friend of yours... He won't 
                         say, but man, is he from squaresville.

               He hangs up and we HINGE WITH him to bring the length of the 
               bar into view. Norville dishevelled, is on the other side 
               bellowing.

                                     NORVILLE
                         I want a martini! It's New Year's 
                         Eve and I want a Martini!

                                     BARMAN
                         Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --

                                     NORVILLE
                         I thought you served misfits here!

               The barman is taking rolled-up blow-beepers out of the 
               cardboard box and loading them into tumblers to set along 
               the bar.

                                     BARMAN
                         Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we 
                         don't sell alcohol.

                                     NORVILLE
                         What kind of bar is it if ya can't 
                         get a martini?!

                                     BARMAN
                         It's a juice and coffee bar, man, 
                         like I been tellin' ya --

                                     NORVILLE
                         I want a martini! On this bar, right 
                         now! I've had a martini in every bar 
                         on the way down here, and I'm not 
                         about to --

                                     BARMAN
                         Martinis are for squares, man.

               Suddenly enraged:

                                     NORVILLE
                         What'd you call me?!

               He starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You son of a --

                                     AMY (O.S.)
                         Norville!

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh?!

               He looks stupidly about, the shoulders of his coat down around 
               his elbows. He sees Amy rushing up.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit 
                         to buy your lunch?!

                                     AMY
                         Oh Norville, I --

               Norville's attention has already left her. He looks for the 
               missing bartender.

                                     NORVILLE
                              (swaying)
                         Barman! Set'm up, fella!

                                     AMY
                         Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to 
                         tell you... so many times... It's 
                         hard to admit when you've been wrong. 
                         If you could just... find it in your 
                         heart to -- to give me another chance --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Hey! Where's that martini?!

                                     AMY
                         Just give me another chance, Norville -- 
                         I can help you fight this thing. I 
                         know this last story was a lie! We 
                         can prove it! We can --

                                     NORVILLE
                         Aww, what's the difference. I'm all 
                         washed up... When you're dead, ya 
                         stay dead... Hey, fella!

                                     AMY
                         Well that just about does it! I've 
                         seen Norville Barnes, the young man 
                         in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville 
                         Barnes the self-important heel, but 
                         I've never seen Norville Barnes the 
                         quitter, and I don't like it!

               She starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting.

                                     AMY
                         ...Fight on, fight on, dear old 
                         Muncie.

               She steps back off the stool. Norville watches her dully, 
               his head swaying.

                                     AMY
                         ...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue; 
                         You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin'
                         Once 'The Munce' is done with you! 
                         Goooooo Eagles!

               She looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at 
               her for a slack-jawed beat Norville can only bring out:

                                     NORVILLE
                         You lied to me! I can't believe you 
                         lied to me! a Muncie girl!

               He lurches off his stool toward the door. Watching him, 
               despair fights with confusion on Amy's face.

                                     AMY
                         But Norville... I...

               She realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple 
               innocent she loved --

                                     AMY
                         ... Oh, Norville!

               -- and bursts into tears.

               Two loud REVELERS reel INTO FRAME, one of them uncurling a 
               blow-beeper at the weeping Amy.

               collar as he recedes, the NEWSIE's VOICE continuing:

               trudging. VOICES WELL UP, ECHOING. A face looms with each 
               voice, hellishly lit, superimposed over the walking Norville:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         ...You're not so slow but you're not 
                         so swell either and it looks like 
                         you're an imbecile after all!... 
                         Noooo, I don't guess you will be 
                         here long... Sure, sure, but even 
                         there they called you dipstick... 
                         lamebrain... dope... schmoe... And 
                         is this sap from chumpsville?!... 
                         imbecile after all... Norville, you 
                         let me down... You let Mrs. Eisenhower 
                         down... You let the American people 
                         down... imbecile after all... 
                         imbecile... I predict you're going 
                         to lose all the good things your 
                         ideas brought you... Please, buddy...! 
                         When you're dead, ya stay dead... 
                         Sure, sure, the kid's screwy -- it's 
                         official...

               This last voice and supered face is Mussburger's.

               Norville DISSOLVES away to leave us ON Sidney in the:

               INT. BOARDROOM

               Hellishly bottom-lit board members sit around the table, 
               conical New Year's hats on their heads. Mussburger, the only 
               one not wearing a cap, waves his cigar as he continues to 
               talk:

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...The barred-window boys are out 
                         looking for him now, and we'll see 
                         how Wall Street likes the news that 
                         the President of Hudsucker Industries 
                         is headed for the booby-hatch. Why, 
                         when the doc gets through with him 
                         he'll need diapers and a dribble 
                         cup...

               The board murmurs appreciatively.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         ...Let me remind you that our secret 
                         post-New Year's party will be held 
                         in the office of the President shortly 
                         after midnight tonight. Remember, 
                         it's strictly stag, so leave the 
                         wives at home; we'll be showing some 
                         films and, yes, gentlemen, there 
                         will be exotic dancers.

               Louder murmuring. One board member leers, a trace of spittle 
               at the corner of his mouth.

                                     MUSSBURGER
                         Well, if that's all...

               With an unnatural rumble he straightens his papers and we...

                                                                JUMP UP TO:

               HIGH NIGHTMARISH DUTCH ANGLE

               of the assembled around the table.

                                     ALL
                         Long live the Hud!

               NORVILLE

               Norville trudges on, faster, sweatier.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Ring out the old! Ring in the new...!

               People come and go, laughing, talking, blowing noisemakers, 
               making merry.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         ...Ring out the old! Ring in the 
                         new! Ring out the --

               Thoomp!! Norville has run into someone. He looks up, dazed.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey, watch where you're -- Say, buddy!

               It is Buzz, the elevator boy, dressed in an ill-fitting tuxedo 
               and a conical party hat. Za-Za is on his arm, towering over 
               him, leering at Norville.

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, 
                         you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a 
                         fired you, I didn't know what I was 
                         doing! I was a little funny in the 
                         head, I --

                                     BUZZ
                         Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.

               Norville is stunned.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...You don't?

                                     BUZZ
                         Nah, that's all forgotten.

                                     NORVILLE
                         ...It is?

                                     BUZZ
                         Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I 
                         could have the job back.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --

                                     BUZZ
                         But he told me you stole that swell 
                         hoop idea from me. What gives!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, Buzz --

                                     BUZZ
                         Say, that was a swell idea!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But, Buzz, you know I never --

                                     BUZZ
                         And Sid says you stole it!

                                     NORVILLE
                         But Buzz --

                                     ZA-ZA
                         Well wuddya waiting for, Clarence --
                         ? Pop him one!

               Boffo!

               Buzz swings and Norville hits the snow hard.

                                     BUZZ
                         Think about that, idea man!!

               Norville groggily raises his head.

                                     PASSERBY
                         Say, isn't he that lunatic?

               Norville looks dopily up at the people in furs and party 
               hats starting to gather.

                                     VOICES
                         ...that big-shot faker... the Wall 
                         Street fraud guy... nuttier than a 
                         fruitcake... they say he's a menace... 
                         wuddya waitin' for, call a cop!...

               We hear SIRENS.

               Norville staggers to his feet. The crowd cringes.

                                     VOICES
                         ...He's on his feet... We can take 
                         him!

               Norville bursts through the crowd, running.

               Buzz starts giving chase, followed by the braver souls, 
               followed by the entire mob.

               NORVILLE

               runs, gasping, turning a corner.

                                     VOICES
                         ...Down here! He went down here!

               Behind Norville, the crowd rounds the corner, led by Buzz.

               A VAN is SCREECHING to a halt and out jump two burly unshaven 
               men in white, one of them holding open a straitjacket, the 
               other carrying a large butterfly net. They join in the chase.

               Norville turns down an alley. A DRUNK drooping off a lamppost 
               gaily waves a bottle at him.

                                     DRUNK
                         Ring out the old! Ring in the new!

               The crowd is running past the mouth of the alley, missing 
               the turn-off.

               LIMESTONE FLOOR

               Norville, gasping, crashes down INTO FRAME, his hands breaking 
               his fall against the limestone. The CAMERA SPINS NINETY 
               DEGREES to reveal that it is not floor but wall he has run 
               into and is now leaning against. Norville looks up, sweating, 
               gasping.

               HIS POV

               The massive Hudsucker Building looms dizzily up towards the 
               stars, capped by the huge Hudsucker Clock.

                                     DISTANT VOICES (O.S.)
                         Ring out the old! Ring in the new!

               HUDSUCKER LOBBY

               Norville staggers in. A gust of icy air that comes in with 
               him flaps a dropcloth off a huge shape that dominates the 
               lobby:

               It is the heroic statue of Norville that we earlier saw him 
               posing for.

               Norville reels over to it, stares dumbly.

               STATUE

               Mutely -- mockingly -- dignified.

               NORVILLE

               He staggers off to the elevators.

               MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

               We are TRACKING ACROSS the office TOWARD Mussburger, his 
               feet up on his desk, laughing demonically, smoking his cigar. 
               CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS swing 
               on his desk; THRUMMMMM -- the SWEEP SECOND HAND of the clock, 
               illuminated now, casts a moving shadow that rolls across the 
               floor. Evil prevails.

               A piece of paper and a pencil lie on his desk; as we APPROACH 
               WE PAN DOWN and SWING AROUND to read it, LOSING Mussburger 
               but still hearing his LAUGHTER.

               MOVING IN ON THE PAPER:

               Musssucker Industries. Hudberger Industries. Sidsucker 
               Industries. This last alternative has been circled in red. 
               Below it has been scribbled:

               Sidney J. Mussburger, President.

               Evil LAUGHTER. Sweeping shadows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NORVILLE'S OFFICE DOOR

               We are TRACKING IN TOWARD the back of Aloysius, the sign 
               painter, who is stooped in front of the door. He looks back 
               over his shoulder, leering PAST the CAMERA, to reveal his 
               work: Under PRESIDENT Norville's name has been scraped away, 
               and painted in is SIDNEY J. MUSSBUR...

               NORVILLE

               He pushes past the sign painter.

               INT. OFFICE

               Dark and empty. Norville is peeling off his coat as he 
               staggers over to the closet.

               We can hear DISTANT REVELRY and the STRAINS of "AULD LANG 
               SYNE."

               Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet 
               and is putting it on: HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future Is Now.

               Norville looks at the door.

               THROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of 
               "Mussburger" being painted into place.

               Norville throws open the window.

               WIND WHISTLES.

               He climbs out.

               LEDGE

               Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down.

               We hear DISTANT CHANTING:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Ten... nine... eight... seven...

               HIS POV

               A sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far, 
               far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling 
               snow.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Six... five... four...

               WIDER ON NORVILLE

               We are FLOATING IN; it is the SHOT with which the movie began. 
               The sweep second hand of the Hudsucker Clock is approaching 
               the 12 of midnight, the New Year. In sync with the clock the 
               CHANTING continues:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Three... two...

               We have COME IN CLOSE ON Norville. A lone tear runs down his 
               cheek.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         ...One...

               BONG! The toll is right at Norville's ear. Startled, he 
               reaches up to press hands against his ears. Distantly:

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Happy New Year!

               BONG!!

               He can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges 
               his way back toward the window.

               HIS POV

               The open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it 
               shut.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Norville waves.

                                     NORVILLE
                         No --

               BONG!!

               His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he 
               trips -- falls -- catches the ledge --

                                     NORVILLE
                         -- No, please!

               He is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. His feet 
               dangle away. Snow falls.

               HIS POV

               Looking STEEPLY UP.

               CLOCK

               Its second hand is making its descent.

               NORVILLE

               Falling.

               MUSSBURGER

               Laughing.

               SECOND HAND

               Descending.

               NORVILLE

               Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with a 
               great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, head 
               down, feet in the air.

               It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that 
               the title of the film was supered over.

               He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.

               PEOPLE IN STREET

               Frozen in attitudes of laughter, celebration. Snow sifts 
               silently down around their motionless bodies.

               MUSSBURGER

               In his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his 
               face.

               HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS

               Frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the 
               apex of its arc. Outside the great arched window, snow falls.

               NORVILLE

               He alone can move, but doesn't fall. He looks awkwardly about, 
               his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down.

               EXT. HUDSUCKER CLOCK

               Its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep.

               WHINING NOISES emanate from within.

               CLOSE SHOT - GREAT GEAR

               The broom handle has been jammed between two cogs, stopping 
               them. We PULL BACK ALONG the handle to reveal Moses, who has 
               thrust it there, and who now TURNS back over his shoulder to 
               address the CAMERA.

                                     MOSES
                         Strictly speakin', I'm never spozed 
                         to do this but... have you got a 
                         better idea?

               NORVILLE

               Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a DISTANT -- 
               very distant -- SINGING.

               HIS POV

               Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building. Someone or 
               something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down 
               from the stars.

               We can make out a male voice, accompanied by STRUMMING:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         She'll be comin' around the mountain 
                         when she comes, She'll be comin' 
                         around the mountain when she comes...

               NORVILLE

               He gapes.

               ANGEL

               -- For it is an Angel, arrives. He is a balding man, wearing 
               rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings 
               sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes 
               to rest, in midair. He puts aside the harp he has been 
               strumming on a nearby windowsill.

                                     ANGEL
                         Love that tune. How ya doin', kid?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Mr... Mr. Hudsucker?

                                     HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)
                         Ta-daaaa!

               Presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward 
               foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to 
               stamp. He lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Wooooo!

               He rights himself. The halo spinning lazily over his head 
               has been jarred askew. With a flick of his forefinger he 
               rights it.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...How d'ya like this thing? They're 
                         all wearin' em upstairs now.

               He blows a dismissive raspberry.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...It's a fad.

               He pats at his robe, produces a white cigar.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Anyway. I hear you've been having, 
                         uh...

               He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist, lighting it. 
               He lights the cigar off his thumb, takes a puff.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Been having some problems with 
                         the board. The more things change, 
                         know what Iyayayeeeeee...

               Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his 
               flaming thumb, which he now waves frantically about.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... 
                         Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I 
                         guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws 
                         to ya, huh, Norman?

                                     NORVILLE
                         Norville.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Mm. Well, say what you like about
                         the man's ethics, he's a balls-to-
                         the-wall businessman. Beat ya any 
                         way he can. Straight for the jugular. 
                         Very effective.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yes sir...

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Anyway. Any particular reason you 
                         didn't give him my Blue Letter? I 
                         mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying 
                         man's last words and wishes, no big 
                         deal.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I 
                         apologize, there was an awful lot of 
                         excitement and I guess I must've 
                         mislaid --

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         It's sittin' in your apron pocket, 
                         right where you left it. Imbecile.

               Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Oh, geez.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is 
                         grounds for dismissal.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Geez, I --

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna 
                         add to your woes. I'm just saying.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yessir.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Well, why don't ya read it.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Sir?

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.

                                     NORVILLE
                         Yes sir...

               He tears open the envelope, reads:

                                     NORVILLE
                         'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. 
                         To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. 
                         My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you 
                         read this, I will have joined the 
                         organization upstairs -- an exciting 
                         new beginning. I will retain fond 
                         memories of the many years you and I --
                         '

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Yeah, yeah, it's the standard 
                         resignation boilerplate -- go down 
                         to the second paragraph.

                                     NORVILLE
                         'Many years, uh... I know that you 
                         will be wondering why I have decided 
                         to move on, ending my tenure at 
                         Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You 
                         will be thinking, Why now, when things 
                         are going so well? Granted, from the 
                         standpoint of our balance sheet and 
                         financials, sure, sure, we're doing 
                         fine. However, Sid. These things 
                         have long since ceased to give me 
                         pleasure. I look at myself now and 
                         no longer see the idealistic young 
                         man who started this company. Now I 
                         see only an empty shell whom others 
                         call a 'success.' How has this come 
                         to pass? When and why did I trade 
                         all of my hopes, dreams and 
                         aspirations, for the emptiness of 
                         power and wealth? What the heck have 
                         I done?

               As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails, 
               then pats down a yawn.

                                     NORVILLE
                         '...Looking back now, Sid, I see 
                         that I allowed time and age to corrupt 
                         my dreams. Instead of fiercely 
                         guarding what was timeless inside of 
                         myself, I let the hubbub of earthly 
                         commerce erode my character, and 
                         dissolve my better self. How is it 
                         that some manage to preserve 
                         themselves where I have failed? 
                         Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if 
                         others love you, you may more securely 
                         love yourself -- but I am alone. I 
                         loved a woman once, Sid, as you well 
                         know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, 
                         an angel who in her wisdom saw fit 
                         to choose you instead of I...'

               Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up.

               Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief.

               He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently 
               quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Skip this part...

               He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Last paragraph, last paragraph.

               Norville looks down the page.

                                     NORVILLE
                         '...And so, Sid, the future does not 
                         belong to such as I -- nor even you. 
                         We have made our compromises with 
                         time. The future belongs to the young, 
                         who may more energetically wage the 
                         battle against corruption. 
                         Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, 
                         and the ringing in of the new, I 
                         hereby bequeath my entire interest 
                         in the company, and my seat on the

                         most recent employee at the time of 
                         my demise. I know this will disappoint 
                         you -- you, Sid, who have served so 
                         diligently and for so long. But --'

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         -- tough titty toenails!

               He roars with laughter.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...That'll show the bastard!

               He merrily wipes his eyes.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Yeah, go ahead.

                                     NORVILLE
                         '...But Sid, let me urge you to work 
                         closely with the new president, and 
                         to keep giving Hudsucker Industries 
                         all your energies -- but not your 
                         soul. For while we must strive for 
                         success, we must not worship it. 
                         Long live the Hud. Waring 
                         Hudsucker...'

               Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod.

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         ...Geez.

               Pleased with himself:

                                     HUDSUCKER
                         Yup. It's all there. Well, see that 
                         it gets delivered in the morning.

               Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the 
               stars.

                                     HUDSUCKER

               MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

               Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great 
               arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on 
               his way back to the heavens.

                                     HUDSUCKER

                         comes...

               We hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door.

               GEAR ROOM

               Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear.

               With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn --

               SWEEP SECOND HAND

               Lurching forward --

               PERPETUAL MOTION BALL

               Swinging down --

               EXT. PAVEMENT

               As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face 
               with one last mighty BONG of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.

               BOOM DOWN

               FROM a tavern sign that says ANN'S 440, DOWN TO the front 
               door, which Norville is entering.

               INT. ANN'S

               Sitting halfway down the bar is Amy, staring morosely into a 
               coffee cup. AT the CUT we are TRACKING BACK, PULLING AWAY 
               FROM her.

               Norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the Go Eagles 
               sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading 
               his fingers.

               Two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little 
               tipsy:

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         What the heck's he doin', Benny?

               Amy looks at Norville, startled. After a moment she 
               reciprocates the sign.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         What the heck's she doin', Lou?

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         What the heck they doin'?

               Norville and Amy embrace.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         You know what they're doin' now, 
                         Lou.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         This I know, Benny.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         This you're familia' with.

               Our PULL BACK ENDS LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the bar, TOWARDS 
               Norville and Amy, now in WIDE SHOT. Resting on the bar in 
               the extreme f.g. are two champagne glasses, half-full of 
               fizzing champagne.

               Norville and Amy kiss.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         ...Geez.

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         ...Geez.

               We hear LABORED, RASPY BREATHING.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         ...Y'all right, Benny?

               In a quavering voice:

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         ...Yeah, I'm... It's just... It's 
                         beautiful, Lou!

               Lou also is beginning to sound choked up:

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         It is beautiful, Benny.

               Almost weeping as Norville and Amy continue their embrace:

                                     BENNY (O.S.)
                         ...It's the most beautiful t'ing I 
                         ever saw.

                                     LOU (O.S.)
                         It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever 
                         saw.

               A BARTENDER ENTERS to BLOCK our VIEW of Norville and Amy.

               He is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a 
               sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves. He looks to either side at 
               Benny and Lou.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You cats comin' from a party?

                                     BENNY
                         Cabbies' affair.

                                     LOU
                         Hacks' New Year's gala.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Crazy. Get you anything else? Sangria? 
                         Carrot juice? Herbal tea?

               REVERSE ANGLE

               We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar.

               Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long 
               flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. On the bar next to him 
               sits a large hourglass.

                                     LOU
                         Bromo.

               Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby 
               bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly 
               that says "1959."

               He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in 
               air, then blows it back out.

                                     BENNY
                         ...Bromo.

               BLUE LETTER

               Lying on the boardroom table. As a hand enters to lay a 
               wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of 
               Moses, the old maintenance man.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         And so began 1959. The new year...

               The hand reenters to lay down a wallet, and then to deposit 
               a burning cigar in an ashtray.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...And the start of a new business 
                         cycle. When he learned that Norville 
                         owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was 
                         upset at first.

               We TILT UP to show that Mussburger is walking toward the 
               boardroom window. Board members silently remonstrate with 
               him as he tries to wrench it open.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...It's a good thing Doc 
                         Bromfenbrenner was there...

               Doctor Bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching, brow 
               furrowed, a pencil pressed to his lips.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...'cause he was able to keep Sidney 
                         from harmin' his ol' self.

               We...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARRED DOOR

               being slammed behind Sidney who, straight-jacketed, is puffing 
               on a cigar as he is led away.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...Now Norville, he went on an' ruled 
                         with wisdom and compassion...

               BOARDROOM

               Again. Norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on 
               an easel: Under the heading BRAND NEW is a large circle. The 
               side view is a flat line.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...and started dreamin' up them 
                         excitin' new ideas again. You know, 
                         for kids!

               The board members look at the design, puzzled.

               Norville takes a drop cloth off of a piece of plastic on a 
               pedestal. He has the board's complete attention.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...An' that's the story of how 
                         Norville Barnes climbed away up to 
                         the forty-fourth floor of the 
                         Hudsucker Buildin'...

               He picks up the plastic disc and as he sails it we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE

               As it floats out the boardroom window.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...an' then fell all the way down, 
                         but didn't quite squish hisself.

               We BOOM UP, AWAY FROM the boardroom, to the great Hudsucker 
               Clock.

                                     MOSES (V.O.)
                         ...Ya know, they say there was a man 
                         who jumped from the fortyfifth 
                         floor... but that's another story. 
                         Heh-heh-heh! Ya-heh-heh-heh!

               We FADE OUT on the clock as Moses' LAUGHTER grows distant 
               and END MUSIC SWELLS.

                                         THE END
THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS

    LONDON 2007.. NOW


1   EXT   NIGHT   URBAN TERRACE                                1

    A row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all
    the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked
    vehicles glistening in the rain.

    A front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts
    in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big
    horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the
    street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses
    are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver.
    It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off
    this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where
    light from a TV flickers.

                        DON
              Carol!... Carol!

                           CAROL (V.O.)
              What?

                        DON
              Come here! Quick!

                        CAROL (V.O.)
              What is it?

                           DON
              Quick!

                        CAROL (V.O.)
                  (irritated)
              I'm trying to watch this! It's the
              last episode!

                        DON
                  (annoyed)
              Come here!!!

    CAROL appears in the doorway.

                        CAROL
              What is it?

    But the wagon and horses have gone.

                           DON
              It's gone!




                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 2.
1   CONTINUED:                                                  1


    CAROL, disgusted, swats him on the head with the flat of her
    hand and goes back inside.


2   EXT/INT   NIGHT    PARKED CAR IN STREET                       2

    A YOUNG COUPLE are snogging in the back of a parked car.
    Music is playing on the radio.

    They are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying
    sight of the huge looming horse-drawn box as it trundles
    past.


3   EXT   NIGHT     THE TOWN HALL CLOCK                           3

    The clock shows and strikes 2am.


4   EXT   NIGHT     A DINGY BACK STREET                           4

    The wagon has stopped. The back begins to open, top, bottom
    and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals.

    Shadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise
    the roof.

    While this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a
    garishly lit club across the street.

    A group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering,
    laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing
    up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having "a great
    time".

    They see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.

                           MARTIN
                 What the...!

    We now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a
    stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby
    travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a
    clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the
    words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS.

    PERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as
    a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man
    (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the
    stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with
    wings on his helmet and sandals.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               3.
4   CONTINUED:                                                4


                           ANTON/MERCURY
                 Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up!
                 Step up!... I, Mercury, the
                 messenger of the gods, invite
                 you... tonight, for one night
                 only... at this very venue... to
                 enter the mind, the very great
                 mind, of Doctor Parnassus!

    PERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind
    ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears
    to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white
    make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of
    yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a
    loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating
    several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass
    plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze
    tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.

                           ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
                 Doctor Parnassus... as old as
                 time... yes, ladies and gentlemen,
                 more than a thousand years old ...
                 he has the power to empower your
                 mind. A secret learned in the
                 mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus
                 open your imagination. Let him
                 guide and transport you to worlds
                 and possibilities you never dreamt
                 of... If you dare. But... Beware...
                 there are dangers. You will have to
                 choose. Will your soul fly?... Or
                 will it be dashed on the rocks of
                 darkness? The choice is yours and
                 yours alone. Transcend the heights
                 on Beauty's wing.

    A young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair
    and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips
    and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length
    mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a
    forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward.

    ANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps
    together. They look enchanting and enchanted.

                           ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
                     (to the audience)
                 Or, if you must...

    Now PERCY, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery .



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                4.
4   CONTINUED: (2)                                             4


                        ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
              ... scour the squalid depths with
              Putrid's brother, Stench!

    PERCY indicates a ticket dispenser attached to the front of
    the stage.

                        PERCY
              Take a ticket and join the queue!
              Only five quid a go! There's no
              greater bargain on planet earth!

    A beer bottle lands on the stage

    The DRUNKEN YOUTHS cheer.

                        ANTON/MERCURY
              You choose... Fulfilment, grace and
              light or... Waste, filth and
              darkness.
                  (under his breath,
                   watching the drunk,
                   MARTIN, with contempt)
              No prizes for guessing what you'll
              do.

    MARTIN has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage.

    His MATES laugh and shout encouragement.

                        ANTON
                  (not in character.. he
                   stutters)
              No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed.
              You have to t-take a t-ticket
              first.

    ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But
    MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the `audience'.

    MARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud.

    MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who
    is still in a trance.

    PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the
    stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash.

    More laughter from the MOB.

                        MARTIN
                  (drunkenly to PARNASSUS)
              Hey you...I wanna audition. I
              wan... I wanna be a star... I
              wanna...

    MARTIN is on the verge of tweaking DOCTOR PARNASSUS' nose or
    pulling his beard when VALENTINA diverts him.

                        VALENTINA
              Stop! Get off the stage!

    MARTIN turns his bleary focus to VALENTINA.

                        MARTIN
              Thas a nice pair of jugs.

    MARTIN'S mates roar their approval.

                        VALENTINA
              Get off the stage!

                        MARTIN
              No. I wan you... I wan you...

    MARTIN lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage.

    MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who
    stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out
    tree.

    ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues
    to chase `Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through
    the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down
    the middle). MARTIN crashes after her.

    ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR
    PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide
    not to but it's a difficult decision.


5   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      5

    The stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now
    seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees.

    `Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as
    MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical
    forest. Beauty's costume has been transformed into something
    wonderful. (A rainbow studded with diamonds?)

    VALENTINA comes into view. MARTIN is in hot pursuit.

                           MARTIN
                 Come here you little sexpot!

    VALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist
    hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a
    moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before
    striding off.

    MARTIN staggers to his feet.

                           MARTIN (CONT'D)
                 Come back! You bitch!

    He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3
    dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground.
    Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark,
    terrible, and very REAL forest. `Beauty' has vanished.


6   EXT   THE STAGE     NIGHT                                     6

    VALENTINA, `Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror.
    Her costume has reverted to its original state. She examines
    her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin.

    ANTON looks at her. She shrugs. DR. PARNASSUS is still in a
    trance, his lips moving soundlessly. ANTON watches DOCTOR
    PARNASSUS in awe. `Beauty' sighs. She's had enough.


7   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      7

    MARTIN is lost and terrified in the dark forest.

                           MARTIN
                 Mum...Mum!...

    His voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are
    interrupted by another sound...a Tarzan-like howl.

    MARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines
    through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look
    like HANDS... with little heads and arms where the wrists
    should be. They are all howling and jabbering.

    From behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by
    the collar, hoisting him high into the air.

    Clearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are
    many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES
    swinging on "vines".



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                    7.
7   CONTINUED:                                                     7

    But, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles...
    dangling from enormous, luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float
    through the dark, frightening, sky.

    From some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just
    out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a
    drink.

                           MARTIN (CONT'D)
                 Please... I'll never...! Never
                 again!. Honest!... From now on... I
                 swear!.. Not a drop!

    With a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops
    jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar.



    Down he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good
    as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going
    SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple
    somersaults and lands on his feet.

    He can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears
    music. Beautiful, ethereal music.

    In the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising
    above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long
    stairway winding up to the summit.

    The HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the "thumbs up",
    and points encouragingly toward the stairway.

    Reformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the      stairs. But on
    reaching them he discovers that each one is 6      feet high. The
    stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult.      Letters are
    carved into the first stair..."THE 12X12 STEP      PROGRAM...GOOD
    LUCK". This is going to be tough.

    The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him
    the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon
    lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink
    before the long climb. He heads for the club.

    The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground
    figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a
    bowler hat and a red waistcoat.

                           MR NICK
                 Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you
                 could use a drink.

    MARTIN, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside.
    The door closes followed by the sound from within of much
    gaiety and laughter.

    THE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A
    BALL OF FLAME.


8   EXT   DINGY BACK STREET                                       8

    The sound of police sirens. We are back outside in front of
    the theatre.

    DR. PARNASSUS rises unsteadily, coming out of his arduous
    trance.... `Beauty" moves to support him as, exhausted, he
    loses his balance and snaps out of his trance.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  (holding his head)
              Valentina...

                        VALENTINA
                  (indignant)
              He was chasing me.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  (angry)
              You don't go through the mirror.

                        VALENTINA
              I had to get away.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
              You hit him.

                        VALENTINA
              Self defence.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
              You're out of control. Ever since
              your mother died...

                        VALENTINA
              When I was three!

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
              I don't want to talk about it!

                        VALENTINA
                  (indignant)
              You brought it up!

                           DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                 We don't accept drunks!

                           ANTON
                 We c-couldn't stop him.

                           DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                 People must be in their right minds
                 when they make the choice.

                           ANTON
                 I know. I'm s-sorry.

                              DRUNKEN GIRL (V.O.)
                 Martin!...

    The POLICE are dealing with a drunken mob of nightclub
    REVELLERS, making arrests.

    A distraught, hysterical, DRUNKEN GIRL is looking for MARTIN.

                           DRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D)
                 Martin!... Martin!...

    She sees `Beauty'.

                           DRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D)
                 He went with that cow! I'll scratch
                 her eyes out!

    A POLICEWOMAN grabs the DRUNKEN GIRL and drags her,
    struggling, into police van.

    MARTIN'S FRIENDS are searching for him around the stage.

                           FRIEND OF MARTIN
                 Marty!? Marty, where are you?
                     (a POLICEMAN grabs him))
                 Oi! Leave off..it's them..they've
                 got our mate back there.

                           POLICEMAN
                     (to PARNASSUS)
                 You! Gunga Din! What do you think
                 you're playing at!?

                           DR. PARNASSUS
                 `Playing'? We don't `play'! What we
                 do is deadly serious!

     DR. PARNASSUS pushes aside the mirror to reveal a door in the
     back wall of the shallow stage. It is swinging open.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Gone. Will we miss him? I don't
               think so.

     The POLICEMAN looks and frowns.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                   (to the POLICEMAN
                   condescendingly)
               Don't worry if you don't understand
               it immediately.

     PERCY, wisely, decides to head off conflict. He steers DOCTOR
     PARNASSUS away from the POLICEMAN.

                         PERCY
                   (to POLICEMAN)
               He's doing his bit to save the
               human race. He thinks it's got a
               future. Quaint, eh? I keep telling
               him to get a proper job.
                   (shaking his empty
                    collection cup)
               Check it out.. another night with
               nothing in the kitty.

                         POLICEMAN
               I want you freaks out of here. Now.
               If I ever see you in this parish
               again I'll do you.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS bows exaggeratedly, with a hint of mockery.

     The POLICE OFFICER suspects that DOCTOR PARNASSUS is taking
     the piss, but decides not to press it. Instead, he knees
     MARTIN'S struggling friend to the ground.


9    EXT   BACK STREETS DAWN                                       9

     The sky is grey with the first light of dawn. The wagon rolls
     off down the dark street as a dustcart rumbles into view and
     its CREW begin emptying bins and picking up rubbish.

     The wagon is parked at the edge of the fair. The stage is
     set. ANTON dressed as Mercury is trying to attract an
     audience, without much success.

                            ANTON
                  Step up! Step up! For one night
                  only! The Imaginarium of Dr.
                  Parnassus! Not to be missed!

     On stage is DOCTOR PARNASSUS, `levitating' and in a trance,
     as before. Incense smoke swirls around him.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  Test your imagination! Envisage the
                  sublime. Let Doctor Parnassus be
                  your guide. Discover the heights of
                  Wisdom...

     VALENTINA dances forward, looking fabulous as `Wisdom'.

                  doldrums with all that's vile and
                  stinks.

     PERCY steps forward, once again in his mediaeval demon
     costume.

                      (indicating ticket

                  Twenty quid a go, reduced to five

                  beauty, enchantment, for those with
                  eyes to see...

     He magically produces a bouquet of flowers. Throws it into
     the air.. it transforms into beautiful doves.

     This impressive trick is totally ignored by a group loudly

     DR. PARNASSUS stirs from his trance. He's had enough of this.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Excuse me! Excuse me! Would you
               mind...

                         LINDA
               It's not fair.

                         UNCLE BOB
               It's the fair, but it's not fair!

     UNCLE BOB laughs uproariously. LINDA pushes him into AUNTY
     FLO.

                         AUNTY FLO
               Ow! Bloody hell!

     Diego - aged 9 and absorbed in his portable video game
     wanders away from the family.

                         MUM
               LINDA! BEEHAVE YOURSELF! I'M
               WARNING YOU!

                         DAD
               Leave her alone!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Please! This is The Imaginarium! It
               requires respect, concentration...
               Kindly go elsewhere and take your
               detritus with you?

                         MUM
               Is he insulting us?

                       threateningly)
               Oy!

     PARNASSUS ignores him and resumes his trance.

     Unnoticed by all, DIEGO has somehow managed to climb onto the
     stage and is peering at the mirror.

                         MUM
                   (looking around)
               Diego!? Where's Diego?

                            DAD
               DIEGO!?

     VALENTINA turns her head just in time to see DIEGO vanish
     through the mirror.

     She starts to go after him, then hesitates.

                         VALENTINA
                   (trying to get ANTON'S
                    attention)
               Pssst!

     ANTON looks across the stage to her. She mimes that a certain
     someone has gone into the mirror. ANTON considers waking
     DOCTOR PARNASSUS but thinks better of it. Instead he heads
     off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of Diego.
     VALENTINA takes over the pitch.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               Ladies and Gentlemen, let Dr.
               Parnassus be your guide...


11   INT/EXT   MAGICAL LANDSCAPE                                 11

     ANTON moves through the cut -out trees and into a fantastic,
     brightly coloured landscape of Dr. Seuss-like hills and
     valleys. The sky if full of cloud-sized soap bubbles.

     Diego is in the distant using his game controller to make the
     bubbles bang into each other...trying to burst them.

     We can hear VALENTINA trying to continue the pitch in the
     face of the family from hell. Their baby has now started
     wailing.

     Cracks in the ground begin to appear under ANTON"S feet.

                  OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! SHUT UP!

     The landscape, in response to DR. PARNASSUS' rage suddenly
     rips apart, fragmenting and spinning with ANTON inside it.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      (enraged)
                  AAAHHHH!!! DAMN AND BLAST!!!

     Things fly in all directions.


12   INT/EXT   MAGICAL LANDSCAPE                                   12

     ANTON, recovering, struggles out from between giant blocks of
     stone. The world has gone dark.

     He hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to
     clamber over the shattered monoliths..

     Reaching the top, ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant
     rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. There are
     what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on
     either side of the pinnacle.

     CUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror. Is he
     lost inside a video game he can't control? He presses the
     buttons on his gaming device - to no avail.

     One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under
     way... all very video-game-like. Thrilling aggressive music
     blares forth.

     MR NICK appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but
     this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a
     bull's-eye on his chest.

                            MR NICK
                  Come on laddy, cross the bridge!
                  Join up! Be a man. Kill the enemy.
                  Impress your dad. Unlimited ammo.
                  Great fun. Pow! Pow! Pow!

     As he speaks bullets fly. Each time MR.NICK gets shot and is
     knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel.

     The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano
     keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. The piano key bridge
     descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL
     PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing
     the same tune - the tune DR. PARNASSUS is humming, but with
     stern, demanding, PIANO TEACHERS in attendance.

                            PIANO TEACHERS
                  No, no, start again! Again! From
                  the top! Again! Practice! Practice!

     DIEGO doesn't know what to do.

     Behind him rises a strange Mongolfier balloon. DR.
     PARNASSUS's face is repeated again and again around its
     circumference. ANTON'S in the basket.

     DIEGO catches sight of ANTON.

                            DIEGO
                  Help!
                      (indicating gaming device)
                  It doesn't work! It's broken!

                              ANTON
                  What?

                              DIEGO
                  The game!

                            ANTON
                  What g-g-game?

                            DIEGO
                  The game! The video game! The one
                  we're in!

                            ANTON
                  I d-d-don't know what you're t-t-
                  talking about.

                              DIEGO

                   (miserable )
               I c-can't.

                           DIEGO
               What?

                         ANTON
               I'm n-not supposed to be here.

                         DIEGO
               What am I going to do?

                         ANTON
               That's the p-point. It's up to you.

                          DIEGO
                    (dismayed)
               But... Don't leave me! Don't let me
               die!

     But ANTON has gone.

     DIEGO, terrified, tests the bridge to the war games.

                         MR NICK
               Attaboy, sonny. Join the men.
               Nothing to it. Hup two, hup two...

     He hesitates...the music from the pianos seems to have an
     effect on him. He comes to a decision. He drops his gaming
     device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly
     piano keys.

     The CUT-OUT shooting target MR NICK isn't happy.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               No, wait! That's the wrong choice!
               That bridge leads to failure and
               despair. You'll be dead before
               you're thirty. This is the one.
               This is the bridge to manhood!

     DIEGO looks uncertain, unnerved. For a moment we think he
     might change his mind, but he presses bravely on across the
     piano bridge.

                                                               17.




13   EXT   A HOLIDAY FAIR   NIGHT                              13

     At last, finally, there's a bit of a crowd around the
     theatre, but drawn only by the FAMILY FROM HELL who are
     making a lot of noise.

                         MUM
                   (hysterical)
               He's been kidnapped! They've taken
               him! It's that weirdo up there! Do
               something, Dad, do something!

                         LINDA
               I want my brother! I want my little
               brother!

     On stage DR. PARNASSUS, continues to hum in his trance-like
     state. INSPECTOR OF FAIRS rattles on.

                         INSPECTOR
               You cannot perform here without
               appropriate authorization.

     Getting no response from DR. PARNASSUS he pulls out his
     mobile phone and dials.

                         INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   (with phone to ear)
               It's me. I need some support. We've
               got trouble.

     ANTON steps out of the mirror. He produces an inflated
     balloon which he releases and which then flies, zig-zagging
     out over the audience.

     DR. PARNASSUS, wakes in time to see the balloon.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (delighted with Anton's
                    `message')
               Ha,ha! Success! One little devil
               out of the fire... makes it all
               worthwhile!

     He magically produces a Tarot Card from the startled
     INSPECTOR'S ear.

                         INSPECTOR
               Where did you say you're from?

                  I didn't.

     He lifts his arm with a flourish whereupon a gloriously
     painted canvas sky unrolls from the top of the set disgorging
     DIEGO as it reaches the stage.

                              DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  Hooplah!

     DIEGO rolls out, tumbles across the stage and lands next to
     the rest of his FAMILY. He's beaming, laughing, full of
     wonder, transformed by his experience.

                            MUM
                  Diego! Where have you been? I've
                  been worried sick!

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (descending from his glass
                       plinth)
                  And so... a glimmer of hope...
                  Perhaps eternity has not been in
                  vain!...

     DAD smacks DIEGO round the back of the head.

                            DAD
                  And you can wipe that silly
                  expression off your face, you
                  little poof.

                            LINDA
                      (gleefully)
                  You're in big trouble! You're in

                            UNCLE BOB

                            AUNTY FLO
                  He's spoilt our evening.

                  And where's your gamer? He's lost
                  his bloody gamer! Another fifty
                  quid down the drain. You're not
                  getting another one! Bloody kids!
                  Why do we bother?

     THE FAMILY FROM HELL moves off.

     DIEGO, full of wonder and oblivious to his family, looks back
     at PARNASSUS and gives the old man the thumbs-up.

     PARNASSUS smiles and raises his thumb in response.

     The INSPECTOR OF FAIRS is joined by a POLICEMAN and
     POLICEWOMAN.

                         POLICEMAN
               What's the trouble?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Ah, the fuzz.

                         POLICEMAN
               What did you say?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (charmingly)
               Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy
               had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
               fuzzy wuzzy?

     The POLICE and the INSPECTOR exchange dark looks. Clearly
     they're dealing with a dangerous trouble-maker.

                         INSPECTOR
                   (to Parnassus)
               Next time I find you doing business
               without a permit I'll impound your
               wagon.

                         POLICEMAN
                   (to Parnassus)
               I'll be doing worse than
               that...now, bugger off!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               With pleasure.

     He bows mock graciously.

     Valentina, half-undressed, is struggling out of her `Wisdom'
     costume while at the same time looking at pictures of
     beautiful homes and gardens in a very battered copy of `Homes

     A movement of something reflected in the dressing-room mirror
     catches her eye.

     In the mirror we see MR NICK, not a CUT-OUT, but the real
     thing.

                  Oh!

     She turns, holding her dress to cover her modesty. There's
     nobody there.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  Who's that? Who's there?


15   EXT   EDGE OF FAIR / THE WAGON       CONTINUOUS              15

     ANTON and PERCY are packing-up and closing the wagon.

     DR. PARNASSUS, out of his make-up and costume, is smiling and
     humming to himself as he removes the feed bag from one of the
     horses.

     The horse lifts its head and DR PARNASSUS recoils in shock
     and horror. Standing directly behind the horse is MR. NICK...
     a huge grin splitting his face.

                            MR NICK
                  Hello Parnassus... It's been a
                  while hasn't it?

     PERCY, winding a rope onto a cleat, hears distant laughter
     and looks up.

     CUT TO PERCY'S P.O.V. where we see, some distance away and in
     a relatively secluded spot, MR NICK rocking with laughter
     while DOCTOR PARNASSUS looks stricken. He clutches at the
     back of a park bench to steady himself.

     CUT TO PERCY who looks thoughtful and worried. He heads off
     to help DOCTOR PARNASSUS as the latter slumps onto the bench.
     MR NICK has vanished.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (distraught)
                  He's come to collect.

                            PERCY
                  I thought so.

                  What can I do?...

                            PERCY
                      (grimly)
                  Nothing.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  There must be something!

     He looks over to where VALENTINA is helping close the
     theatre. PERCY follows his gaze.

                            PERCY
                  You're going to have to tell her.


16   EXT   CITY STREETS      LATER                             16

     The wagon makes its way through city streets.

     PERCY is sitting on the roof driving. ANTON is lying on the
     roof looking up at the stars. VALENTINA is sitting next to
     him lost in thought.

                            ANTON
                  Look at that moon.
                      (no response from
                       Valentina)
                  I've n-never seen it so b-big. And
                  the stars...It's so c-clear.

     PERCY holds his hand out, palm up.

                            PERCY
                      (sardonically)
                  Rain.

                             ANTON
                      (sotto voce)

                      (irritated)
                  Val... Val.

                  Parnassus d-doesn't like it.

                  He's not here is he? He's inside
                  getting pissed.

                            ANTON
                  Are you happy?

                      (ironic)
                  Ecstatic.

     ANTON produces an old beaten-up copy of `Beautiful Homes' and
     starts thumbing through it.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  Hey! That's mine!

     She tries to snatch it from him.    He flutters it out of her
     reach.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  Give it me!

     She wrests it from him and hides it just as PERCY looks back
     at them.

                            ANTON
                      (sotto voce)
                  Would you really be happy in one of
                  those p-places?... N-not me.
                  Well... m-maybe....with you.
                      (suddenly urgent)
                  Let's run away. Make a new life
                  together. I'll retrain. Computers.
                  Stocks and bonds. We could be
                  happy. Just the two of us.

                         VALENTINA
               See? Parnassus says so too. Are you

                         ANTON
               I don't mind. He's extraordinary...

                Parnassus is a pain. Okay he's
                extraordinary but I'm not. I don't
                want to be like him. I want to be
                like other people. Like them.
                (gesturing to the passing city)
                You know... normal. Ordinary.
                You're so lucky.

     She gets up, kisses ANTON on the top of his head and climbs
     down into the hatch.

     Anton looks thoughtful, bruised.

     PERCY glances back.

                Actually, I'm going to be sixteen.
                Shall I tell Parnassus I know? I
                think he knows I know. Silly man.
                Sweet sixteen.

17   INT   DOCTOR PARNASSUS' DEN   THAT MOMENT                    17

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS' cabin is tiny. It's packed with books and
     memorabilia; Egyptian/Assyrian/Greek/etc., magic trick
     paraphernalia, and much else.

     A hanging lantern suspended from the ceiling throws moving
     shadows.

     DR. PARNASSUS is slumped despondently on a cramped bed. A
     plate of untouched food sits on a table in front of him.

     He has laid out tarot cards. To the right - The Magus.. to
     the left - The Devil. The next card is The Maiden. He places
     it carefully beneath The Magus.

     He picks up an open bottle of spirits and takes a swig.
     Clearly he's already had a few drinks.

     She starts tidying up.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (avoiding the question)
                  I should never have brought you

     DR PARNASSUS reaches up and plucks a glass paperweight out of
     the air. It's that kind that contains little models which are
     engulfed in a snow storm when the paperweight is shaken.

     DR. PARNASSUS shakes the paper-weight and watches the `snow'
     swirl about.

     A HOODED RIDER moves slowly through the snowstorm, the horse
     picking its way carefully across a field of virgin snow.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
               ... I was visited... by someone I
               had hoped never to meet.

     In the distance, rising like a dark mountain, is a strange
     monastery. Dim light comes from a couple of windows.

     We can hear, from far away, the indistinct droning voice of
     the story teller, a younger DR. PARNASSUS.

     THE CAMERA moves up over and way ahead of the HOODED RIDER,
     continuing through the snowstorm, over fields, forests,
     valleys, rocks, until it reaches the monastery, high on a
     rugged hill. Here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery

     Entering via a window and looking down into the monastery
     dining hall, we see DOZENS OF MONKS sitting at a long
     refectory table. They are eating their supper and listening
     to a young DR. PARNASSUS who is sitting on a dais at the far
     end of the hall, his eyes closed, in a trance, telling a
     story.

     A log fire burns in a big fireplace.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               ... Having captured the wind and
               tamed the storm ... the Chief
               Steward, laying down to take his
               rest, had a disturbing dream... He
               dreamt that a hooded rider was
               approaching across the snow-swept
               plain.

                                                                  28.
19   CONTINUED:                                                  19
                            DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  A rider who would challenge the
                  very foundations of the world...

     The door to the refectory swings open with a crash.

     The MONKS look up.

     Standing on the thresh-hold is the hooded figure, covered
     with snow.

     He throws off his hood.    It's MR NICK.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  ... The Steward woke and remembered
                  his dream. What manner of man had
                  he dreamt of, and what did it
                  signify?


20   INT   MONASTERY DINING HALL        LATER                    20

     DR. PARNASSUS and MR NICK are sitting at the fire.

     Behind them, in the hall, MONKS come and go.

     On the dais, a MONK continues with the story. This monk is a
     younger PERCY.

                            PERCY
                  ... And as the waters rose... the
                  people's need for stories grew.
                  Stories that would feed a great
                  hunger. A hunger for more than just
                  understanding...

     PERCY continues telling the story in the background.

                            MR NICK
                  What exactly do you do here?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  We tell the eternal story.

                            MR NICK
                  Oh.... What's that?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  The story that sustains the
                  universe. The story without which
                  there is nothing.

                                                               29.
20   CONTINUED:                                               20


                            MR NICK
                  Nothing? Really. Are you telling me
                  that if you stop telling a story...
                      (waving in the direction
                       of Percy)
                  This story... something you made
                  up, a fiction... that the universe
                  ceases to exist?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  You make it sound so simple.

                            MR NICK
                  And you believe it?

     DR. PARNASSUS smiles.

                            MR NICK (CONT'D)
                  Incredible. It's just incredible to
                  me that you can believe something
                  that can be so easily disproved.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (complacently)
                  I don't think so.

     MR NICK turns and throws a spell at PERCY who goes rigid like
     a statue - struck dumb. The story stops.

                              DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                        (alarmed)
                  No!

     Another MONK, sitting at the table, immediately continues the
     story.

                            SUBSTITUTE MONK
                  ..having been brought to the limit
                  of his endurance...

     MR NICK freezes him too, stopping him from speaking.

     A third monk continues.

                            THIRD MONK
                  ...yet the forces of evil could not
                  prevail, and...

     MR.NICK renders him silent.

                              DR. PARNASSUS
                  Stop!


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                 30.
20   CONTINUED: (2)                                             20


     MR NICK zaps DR. PARNASSUS and all the other MONKS. All
     still. None of them can speak.

                          MR NICK
               There you are. You see. The story's
               stopped. No more story... And yet,
               we're still here, the fire's still
               burning...

     He pushes open a window.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               It's still snowing. The wind's
               still blowing. Nothing's changed.

     DR. PARNASSUS and the MONKS, still struck dumb, look
     appalled.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               Cheer up... I've freed you from
               this ridiculous nonsense.

     MR NICK undoes the spell.

     The MONKS moan. DR. PARNASSUS slumps down in despair.

     MR NICK smiles and lights a cigarette. He's enjoying this.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               Now you can use your powers to do
               something else. Have fun, travel,
               learn a foreign language...

     Splat! A gob of bird shit lands on MR. NICK'S head. An eagle
     circles overhead. It swoops across the hall and exits through
     a window.

     DR. PARNASSUS leaps up, laughing, amazed, revived.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               A sign! A message! That bird was a
               messenger... from distant places we
               know not of!
                   (triumphant)
               Other places! The point is, you're
               wrong! And I'm wrong! It doesn't
               have to be us here!
                   (indicating monks)
               Somewhere in the world, at any
               given time... someone is telling a
               story! Sustaining the universe!
               Right now, it's happening.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               That's why we're still here. You
               can't stop stories being told
               somewhere! You can't be everywhere!

     MR NICK is furious.

                         MR NICK
                   (irritated)
               A weak hypothesis!

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (smiling)
               Yes?

     MR NICK stubs out his cigarette.

                         MR NICK
               I tell you what... You're probably
               not a betting man but...

     MR NICK whispers into the DR. PARNASSUS's ear.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
               And so I made a wager with the
               devil.


21   EXT   ON THE ROAD (MIDDLE AGES)    DAY/NIGHT               21

     DR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are travelling the world with a
     little theatre. Giving performances. Inviting AUDIENCE
     MEMBERS onto the stage to participate.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
               Whichever of us won ten converts
               first, would win the bet... My
               argument was the importance of the
               story, the power of the
               imagination... His, the power of
               material things, the supremacy of
               stuff... Naturally... I won.

     CUT TO another performance. Now the 16TH CENTURY.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O. (CONT'D)
               My prize...
                   (a voice filled with
                    horror)
               ... was ever-lasting life.

     Another show...now the 18TH CENTURY

                  Everlasting... Everlasting... Times
                  changed. No one wanted our tales
                  any longer.


22   EXT.   MODERN CITY STREET     DAY                             22

     DR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are performing on a street corner in
     modern clothes. As are all the PASSERSBY who pay them no
     attention.

     They look exhausted, like beggars...and very old.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
                  It seemed as though the Devil,
                  after all... had triumphed... And
                  then... one day....

     A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (played by the same actress as Valentina,
     but older with different coloured hair) comes into view.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  From the very first moment I saw
                  her, I was head-over-heels in love.
                  She was beautiful, enchanting,
                  delightful, young... But I... I was
                  several thousand years old! How
                  could I woo her? What could I do?


23   EXT.   CLIFF TOP    EVENING                                   23

     CUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR
     PARNASSUS, trying to prevent him from throwing himself off
     the cliff.

                            PERCY
                  Don't be a fool! You can't die!
                  You're immortal! You'll just end up
                  broken, in the eternity ward, and
                  I'll be stuck looking after you!
                  Forever!

     DR. PARNASSUS breaks free, stumbles backwards, and pitches
     out into space. PERCY screams.

                            DR. PARNASSUS V.O.
                  At times like these... the devil is
                  never far away.

     DR. PARNASSUS is hanging by his coat, snagged on a branch
     angled out from the cliff face and held, like a fishing rod,
     by MR NICK who has a great grin on his face.


24   EXT.   RIVER      DAY                                     24

     CUT TO a much younger DR. PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
     in a row boat, picnicking, as they float down a river. They
     are in love, very happy to be together.

     PERCY, wearing a blazer, flannels and straw boater is rowing
     or punting.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
                  The devil granted me mortality
                  again...and youth and great powers.
                  I won my bride. I was in love. But
                  at what price...

     The boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to
     push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up,
     DR. PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank, fishing,
     smoking a cigarette. It's MR NICK .

     There is a loud and ominous clap of thunder.


25   INT.   PARNASSUS' DEN        NIGHT                        25

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  ...at what price....

     DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and
     drops the paper-weight.

                               VALENTINA
                  Father!...

     At that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear
     frantic banging on the roof.

     DR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  We've stopped.

                            VALENTINA
                  What do you mean `at what price'?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (turning back to his Tarot
                       cards)
                  It'll wait, it'll wait. Another
                  time. Something's happened. You'd
                  better go and see.

                            VALENTINA
                  Typical! You insist I listen to a
                  story and then you don't finish it!

     More banging from above.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Go and see!

     VALENTINA turns and goes.

     PARNASSUS looks miserable but, almost relieved.    He turns
     over the next card.

     It's The Hanged Man. It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet
     surrounded by several arcane objects.

     PARNASSUS studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from
     it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the
     others. He takes a swig from the bottle.


26   EXT   WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE     NIGHT                 26

     The wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriar's bridge.
     It's pouring with rain.

     VALENTINA, wearing some sort of covering against the rain,
     climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon.

     Here she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames.

                            ANTON
                  Incredible! I saw somebody d-
                  dancing in the air.. under the b-
                  bridge..

     VALENTINA looks doubtfully at PERCY who peers morosely out
     from under his sou-wester and shakes his head.

                             ANTON (CONT'D)
                  It's true! There was a sh-shadow on

     Lightning flashes again.

     We see what ANTON and VALENTINA see. A shadow, on the water,
     of someone `dancing', hung by his neck with a rope attached
     to the underside of the bridge.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                      (triumphant)
                  You see! The d-dancer!

                            VALENTINA
                      (horrified)
                  There's someone hanging there!

                            ANTON
                      (smugly to Percy)
                  I t-told you!

                            VALENTINA
                  A rope! Get a rope!


27   EXT   SIDE OF BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE      MOMENTS LATER      27

     ANTON is `absailing' over the side of the bridge. One end of
     a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the
     bridge parapet. A lantern dangles from his waist.

     VALENTINA and PERCY watch ANTON'S perilous descent.

     Moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge,
     the mysterious HANGING MAN'S and ANTON'S.

     The MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking
     in his dance of death. His hands are tied behind his back.

     ANTON can't reach the MAN.

                            ANTON
                      (shouting up)
                  I c-can't reach him.

                               VALENTINA
                  Try again!

                               PERCY
                  Swing in!

                               VALENTINA
                  Hurry up.




                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                               36.
27   CONTINUED:                                               27


     ANTON shoots PERCY and VALENTINA a jaundiced look and with
     VALENTINA'S help on her end of the rope begins to swing back
     and forth.

     Eventually, with a big enough swing, he manages to hook his
     foot around the HANGING MAN who has gone limp. Dead.

     With extreme difficulty and great discomfort, ANTON pulls the
     MAN close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the
     MAN'S rope.

     ANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on
     ANTON'S rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half.

                               ANTON
                  Arghhh!!!!

                            VALENTINA
                  You've done it! Brilliant!

                               ANTON
                  Argggg!!!

                            PERCY
                  Come on, don't hang about! We're
                  getting soaked up here!


28   EXT   PAVEMENT ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE A LITTLE LATER     28

     VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY manhandle the MAN over the parapet
     and onto the pavement.

     DR. PARNASSUS has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon.
     Soaked. He's drunk and is swaying.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Why are you fishing dead people out
                  of the river? He's dead. Leave him.
                  Let's go. Before the police turn
                  up.

     He goes, unsteadily, back inside.

     VALENTINA and ANTON drag the MAN under the wagon, out of the
     rain.

     The MAN is dressed in an expensive Saville Row suit. His
     jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols
     have been scrawled on his forehead. He's about 30 years old
     and very handsome.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

28   CONTINUED:                                                      28


     The MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the
     kiss of life.

     ANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the
     kiss of life and he pulls her away.

                            ANTON
                  No! That won't work. And anyway,
                  you d-don't know where he's b-been.
                  Let me...

     He brings both fists down hard on the centre of the MAN'S
     chest.

     Boing! The `dead' MAN coughs, sits bolt upright, spits out a
     little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of
     the wagon, knocking himself out.

     The little metal tube clatters over the asphalt.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  He's alive!

                               VALENTINA
                  Thank God.

                            PERCY
                  Well, he was.

     ANTON picks up the little metal tube and examines it.

                            ANTON
                  What on earth is this?


29   EXT   BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE        REAR OF WAGON MOMENTS LATER   29

     VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY drag the MAN from under the wagon
     and carry him to the rear.


                            VALENTINA
                  Put him in the big trunk.

                               ANTON
                  B-but...

                            VALENTINA
                  Don't argue.

                            PERCY
                  The boss said leave him.


                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                                 38.
29   CONTINUED:                                                 29


                            VALENTINA
                  He thought he was dead.

     They start to bundle the MAN in one of the travelling trunks
     attached to the back of the wagon. With the body hanging
     half in half out, ANTON suddenly stops.

                            ANTON
                  I d-don't like it. It's none of our
                  b-business.

                            VALENTINA
                  So, what do you suggest, we leave
                  him on the side of the road?

     ANTON doesn't want to answer that one.

                            PERCY
                      (walking away)
                  Definitely.

     VALENTINA, single-handedly, hefts the MAN into the trunk and
     carefully places a cushion under his head. An action not
     missed by ANTON.


30   EXT   DERELICT BUILDINGS       DAWN                         30

     The wagon stands, hidden, among deserted derelict buildings.
     All is quiet.

     The lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens.

     The MAN struggles out. His neck is sore, his wrists ache and
     his head is bruised. He hasn't a clue where he is. He tries
     to make sense of the wagon, the grazing horses, the derelict
     buildings.

     Some distance away a bizarre, horned and tailed CREATURE is
     involved in a strange contorted dance.

     Hoping to avoid the CREATURE, the MAN starts to move away but
     is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him.

                              PERCY (V.O.)
                  Hey, you!

     The MAN turns around to find PERCY looking at him.

                            PERCY (CONT'D)
                  I suppose somebody saves your life
                  everyday of the week.

                      (croaking)
                  What?

     He can hardly speak. It hurts him to do so.

                            PERCY
                  Too much like routine to bother
                  with a thank you.

                            MAN
                      (with difficulty)
                  Who are you?

                  et Sansepolcro da Piemonte the
                  Third. If that proves too
                  difficult, you may call me Percy.

                            MAN
                  Where are we?

                            PERCY
                  Geographically, in the Northern
                  Hemisphere. Socially, on the
                  margins. Narratively, with some way
                  to go. And your name is...

                            MAN
                      (appalled)
                  I... I can't remember.

                            PERCY
                  That's handy.

     PERCY whistles to the dancing CREATURE, who turns and
     approaches. The MAN is getting very nervous.

                            PERCY (CONT'D)
                  Any credit cards?

                            MAN
                  What?..Oh..OK... you can have
                  whatever you want.. just don't..

                            PERCY
                  ...with your name on them.

               My wallet... it's gone. Nothing.
               I've been robbed.

                         PERCY
               Don't look at us.

                         CREATURE
               What's your name?

                         PERCY
                   (sceptical)
               He can't remember.

     Suddenly a mobile phone starts ringing. They all look at
     each other. It's in the MAN'S pocket. But, he doesn't move.
     The CREATURE takes his head off ..it's ANTON.

                         ANTON
               Might be for you.

                         PERCY
               They'll know who you are.

     The MAN still doesn't move. ANTON reaches over and tries to
     find the phone in the MAN'S pockets. The MAN tries to push
     him off and find the phone himself. The phone is retrieved
     but, in the struggle to answer it, it's dropped.

     A WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN can be heard from the phone. As
     ANTON and the MAN dive for it, the MAN `accidently' steps on
     it. The phone is crushed.

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
               Pity.. I speak Russian.

     ANTON and PERCY glare with deep suspicion at the MAN.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (O.S.)
               Dammit! I told you to leave him. He
               was dead.

     DR. PARNASSUS, holding a cold, damp towel to his throbbing
     head, appears, coughing and miserable from the wagon.

                         PERCY
               Well, we didn't and he isn't.

                         ANTON
               He was hanging under the b-bridge.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS

               By his neck. Until dead. If we'd
               had any sense.

     ANTON produces the bricks with strange markings that were in
     the MAN'S pockets.

                         ANTON
               We found these in his p-pockets.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS examines the bricks with great interest.

     He pulls out The Hanged Man card and compares it's arcane
     details - a noose, strangely marked shapes like bricks, a
     metal tube - to the objects found on the MAN.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS

               These marks... I recognize them.

     The MAN wipes his hand across his forehead. Looks at his inky
     hand.. confused.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                   (sotto voce)
               You've been sent by Mr Nick.

                   (impassioned)
               Don't toy with me. Tell me you're

               hear!

     TONY doesn't know what DR PARNASSUS in talking about but he
     grasps the fact that if he wants to be allowed to stay here
     he needs to play along.

                         MAN
               Yes.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Thank God! Thank God! Thank God for
               that!

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes PERCY aside, shows him the Hanged Man
     Tarot Card and indicates the MAN with a nod.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               He's from Mr Nick.

                         PERCY
               No he's not.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               He's come with a proposal.

                         PERCY
               No he hasn't.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               All is not lost.

                         PERCY
               What proposal?

                         VALENTINA
               Father?

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                   (looking at the card, then
                    to the MAN)
               You're welcome.

                   (croaking)
               Thank you.

     PERCY groans and tears his hair.

     VALENTINA is pleased. ANTON is not.

     VALENTINA kisses PARNASSUS on the cheek.

                                                               44.

     The MAN precedes DOCTOR PARNASSUS in the tiny room. He looks
     around in amazement.

                           DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                 We can talk here. Sit down, sit
                 down.

                              MAN
                 Thank you.

     He does so. DOCTOR PARNASSUS sits opposite him.

                 From Mr Nick. What does he want?

                           MAN

     The wagon is parked in a shopping mall parking lot. The
     theatre is being opened up by PERCY and ANTON. There are a
     few late night SHOPPERS coming and going.


33   INT   BACKSTAGE                THAT MOMENT                   33

     VALENTINA, dressed as `Beauty', is rummaging in a theatre
     skip, helping the MAN find something to wear for the show.

     There is a slight whiff of sexual attraction in the air.

                            VALENTINA
                  He says you must work... to focus
                  your mind. You can help out front..
                  sell tickets. Ah, here we are...

                       bottomed wig)
                  Try this. You can be `Justice'.

     The MAN tries on the wig and looks in a mirror.

     VALENTINA tries not to laugh.

                  Just like the rest of us.

                  No face. No name. The mystery
                  thickens. I'm going to have to give
                  you a name...

     She presses a metal breast-plate to his chest.

                  ... until you remember who you are,
                  I dub thee Saint George. You can

                  Now you are making fun of me.

                  I'm sorry but, nobody laughs at me
                  without paying the price....ah,ha.

     He begins tickling her. She laughs uncontrollably, falling
     backwards into the costume skip..

     ANTON enters wearing his Mercury gear.       He freezes, seeing

     VALENTINA and ANTON arrive in the doorway, dismayed.

     GEORGE hovers in the background.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS is attempting to get ready for the show but
     he's so drunk he can hardly stand. He's already put some
     article of clothing on back-to-front or inside out. PERCY is
     trying to help.

                           VALENTINA
                Oh no!

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS

                    (seeing Man in doorway)
                Can you remember?

                Not yet.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                Bloody useless! Mr Nick sends an
                emissary and he can't bloody
                remember! It's a bloody disaster!

                          VALENTINA
                You can't go on. You're drunk.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                I am not drunk! I'm under
                considerable stress.

35   EXT   SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT    THEATRE                  35

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS is on   stage, floating' on his glass pillar,
     apparently in a trance   but,humming erratically. He is flanked
     by VALENTINA and ANTON   who stay close to PARNASSUS in case he
     falls. PERCY is in his   medieval costume/one-man-band outfit.
     They all look uneasy.

     VALENTINA peers out over the `footlights' in the hope of
     catching sight of GEORGE.

                            VALENTINA
                  Where's George?

     He's nowhere in sight.

                      (sarcastically)
                  P-probably remembered he had a wife
                  or t-two back in Russia.

     VALENTINA gives him a dirty look.

                                                                  49.




36   INT   SHOPPING MALL SUPERMARKET     THAT MOMENT              36

     GEORGE, wearing his `romantic' Venice carnival mask is smooth-
     talking several middle-aged LADIES on queue at the
     supermarket check-out.

     He's carrying the theatre's ticket dispenser.

                         GEORGE
               Three tickets for the price of
               two... That's a fantastic deal.
               It's a brilliant show. Much better
               than sex.

     Much ribald laughter from the flattered LADIES.

     The shoppers have gone. The last car drives out of the car
     park leaving it empty except for the theatre wagon.

     ANTON, VALENTINA and PERCY are on their own.

     PARNASSUS, on his plinth, is asleep and snoring.

                         ANTON
               Thank G-God... N-not a single

               He's never not done a show

                   (hopefully)
               Maybe it's time to retire.

     PARNASSUS groans in his sleep.

     Bubbling with excitement, the mob arrives.

                  Oh look! How fascinating.

     The other WOMEN agree.

                            EVELYN (CONT'D)
                      (looking at her watch)
                  When does the next show start?

                            PERCY
                  There isn't a next show.

     EVELYN and the other WOMEN are puzzled.

                            PERCY (CONT'D)
                  We've done all the shows we're
                  doing here this evening.

                            DEIDRE
                  But we've got tickets.

     GEORGE looks hopefully at VALENTINA and ANTON who don't know
     what to say.

     We hear a crash.

     THE CAMERA PANS around. PARNASSUS has fallen off his perch
     and is now lying on the floor...snoring and mumbling.

     VALENTINA and some of the WOMEN run forward.

                            SYLVIA
                  This man's drunk. Dead drunk.

                            EVELYN
                  Disgraceful.

                            VALENTINA O/S
                      (suddenly defensive of her
                       father)
                  He's not drunk. He's got a bad
                  cold....

                            GEORGE
                  But being a true professional he
                  tried to keep going, at
                  considerable risk to his health.

     VALENTINA and GEORGE exchange a quick look. VALENTINA thinks
     she's found a kindred spirit.

               We want our money back.

                         GEORGE
               No problem...dear ladies. No
               problem at all. I'm so terribly
               sorry. I can't apologize enough.
               You can have your money back or, if
               you like... an extra free ticket.
               Better yet, two extra free tickets
               if you buy another ticket at half
               price. This offer is only available
               today.

     The WOMEN look on the verge of taking up the offer.

     ANTON and PERCY exchange looks. They can't believe GEORGE'S
     chutzpah.


38   EXT   CAR PARK     A LITTLE LATER                         38

     The wagon rumbles across the deserted carpark.


39   INT   THE WAGON    THAT MOMENT                            39

     A large pile of coins with quite a few notes mixed in tumble
     onto a table. GEORGE is emptying his pockets while VALENTINA
     and ANTON look on..

                         VALENTINA
               Wow! You took all that?

                         GEORGE
               I got carried away.

                         ANTON
               Lying through your t-teeth can do
               that to you.

                          VALENTINA
               Anton!

                         GEORGE
                   (unperturbed)
               Most of them were coming tomorrow.

                         ANTON
               What tomorrow? We're gone.

                      (shrugs)
                  Okay, if it makes you feel better,
                  I'll give it back.

                            ANTON
                      (sarcastic)
                  N-no, keep it. Thanks to you we can
                  afford to buy Valentina a b-
                  birthday cake.

                            VALENTINA
                      (offended)
                  That's enough!

     ANTON storms off. GEORGE looks at VALENTINA sympathetically.

                            GEORGE
                  Don't be angry with him. He's a
                  little bit jealous. He's young.
                  Insecure. I'll make it my job to
                  boost his confidence.

     VALENTINA smiles at George with admiration and approval.

                            GEORGE (CONT'D)
                  When's your birthday?


40   EXT   SUPERMARKET CAR PARK         THAT MOMENT              40

     As the wagon trundles out of the deserted car park a DARK
     FIGURE hops onto the rear platform.


41   INT   DOCTOR PARNASSUS' CABIN      MOMENTS LATER            41

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS is groaning and clutching his head. He has a
     fierce hangover. He pours some powder from a packet into a
     glass of water, stirs it with his finger and knocks it back.
     He grimaces and shudders.

     A hatch/shutter on the small window behind him slides open to
     reveal the grinning head of MR NICK.

                            MR NICK
                  You shouldn't drink, it doesn't
                  agree with you.

     Startled, DOCTOR PARNASSUS spins around.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  What do you want? I'll do anything.

                            MR NICK
                      (smiles)
                  I know.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  You're man's lost his memory! He's
                  bloody hopeless!

                            MR NICK
                  He's not my man.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  What?

                            MR NICK
                  Tony Shepherd. Little toe-rag. He
                  used to run a big charity. I
                  wouldn't trust him. But then... you
                  don't trust me do you?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  For God's sake! Tell me what you
                  want!

                            MR NICK
                  I just thought...seeing you so
                  upset last night...that you needed
                  a glimmer of hope...maybe a little
                  bet?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  On Valentina?

                            MR NICK
                  No?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  You bastard!

                            MR NICK
                  First to five?... You might win.
                  And save her. What do you have to
                  lose?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  I'll kill you!

                   (laughs)
               Now that would be something. By her
               birthday then.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               What! Impossible!..you've seen the
               business we're doing.

                         MR NICK
               Things are going to pick up. As
               sure as eggs is eggs.

     He closes the hatch/shutter with a bang.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Wait!

     Too late. He's gone.


42   EXT   DERELICT BUILDINGS     DAWN                           42

     Back amongst the derelict buildings the Troupe is resting and
     doing chores. The horses are grazing.

     VALENTINA sits at a mirror fussing with various hair styles -
     slyly trying to catch GEORGE's attention.

     PARNASSUS, holding his aching head, sits a short distance
     away sadly watching her. PERCY is with him.

                         PERCY
               Five souls.. two days, eh!?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Shh! I'm trying to think.

                         PERCY
               I told you didn't I?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
               What?

                         PERCY
               That he was a wrong-un.

     PERCY nods his head in George's direction.

                             DR. PARNASSUS
                  Trust in providence, Percy.
                  Remember the hanging man. The cards
                  don't lie.

                            PERCY
                  No... but they sure as hell like
                  being economical with the truth.

     CUT TO ANTON who is painting a long-stemmed, wooden
     flower...he comes over to VALENTINA with it in his hand.

                            VALENTINA
                      (looking away)
                  Don't talk to me.

                            ANTON
                  P-please...I'm sorry about last
                  night. I behaved like an idiot.

                            VALENTINA
                  Yes.

     ANTON suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud.
     Then spins, flips the flower high into the air and, rolling
     face down onto his stomach, catches the stem with his
     clenched buttocks. VALENTINA bursts out laughing.

                            ANTON
                  You must admit... even idiots have
                  their qualities.

     CUT TO GEORGE who is peeling potatoes, badly. PARNASSUS and
     PERCY come up behind him.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  George... We'd like to know who you
                  really are.

                            GEORGE
                  What?... Yes. Me too.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  I may be able to help.

                            GEORGE
                  Really? What?... How...?

     PERCY produces a small contraption with wires from behind his
     back and gives it to DR PARNASSUS.

                         PERCY
               You won't feel a thing.

     GEORGE takes the end of the wire.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               I'm going to put the tips of my
               fingers on the top of your head.

     He does so.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               I want you to relax and try as far
               as possible to think of nothing.

                          GEORGE
               That's not difficult... in my
               condition.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS closes his eyes. He seems to be making an
     effort.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Hold your breath.

     GEORGE does so.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               Very good, very good. Yes... Yes, I
               see... I see... Very interesting.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes his hand from GEORGE'S head and gives
     the contraption back to PERCY.

                         PERCY
               You may breathe normally.

     The effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS. He needs to sit
     down.

                           GEORGE
               What... ?

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Alas, this technique has its
               limitations.

                         GEORGE
               But... Did you discover anything?

     PAUSE.

     VALENTINA and ANTON begin to pay attention and gather around.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               And... you used to do good works.
               Something to do with charity I
               think.

               Yes...That's right! That's right!
               But how?...

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                   (dismissively)
               It's an ancient technique of mental
               divination, but I'm very rusty and
               it doesn't always work
               satisfactorily.

                         TONY
               But that's amazing! Brilliant!
                   (oddly concerned)
               Was there anything else?

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS shakes his head, no.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (relieved)
               That's absolutely fantastic! Thank
               you. Perhaps I'll remember other
               things.

     PARNASSUS smiles and bows slightly ironically.

               Charity work? I knew you were a
               good person.

                         PERCY
               So what was he doing dangling under
               a bridge from his neck?

                            VALENTINA
               Percy!

                         PERCY
                   (sarcastic)
               Oh dear, was that a rude question?
               Have I put my foot in it?

                         TONY
               That's so strange. And horrible..
               it's a complete blank. But I do
               remember I was involved in some
               sort of charity.. trying to do
               good, to make the world a better
               place, you know...inspire people,
               give them hope....
                   (self deprecatingly)
               What an arrogant idiot.

     VALENTINA looks at him thinking `what a sympathetic person.'

     The sound of a flutey whistle distracts him. ANTON is blowing
     a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               What's that?

                         ANTON
                   (with a superior air)
               Mozart's flute concerto in G.

                         TONY
               I mean, the pipe. Where did you get
               it?

     ANTON looks at the metal pipe.

                         ANTON
               I found it.

                            TONY
               It's mine.

               Oh. You're a musician n-now.

                         TONY
               It's not a musical instrument. May
               I have it?... Please.

                         ANTON
                   (teasing)

               Positive.

                            ANTON
               Alright.

     ANTON appears to offer the pipe to TONY but palms it so that
     when TONY reaches out to take it, it's gone.

                         ANTON (CONT'D)
               It's g-gone.

                         TONY
                   (getting shirty)
               Don't fool around.

                         ANTON
               Ah, there it is.

     TONY once more tries to take it. Once more ANTON makes it
     disappear.

                         TONY
                   (angry)
               Give it to me!

                   (derisively)
               Oooooh!

                         VALENTINA
               Anton, that's enough.

     She steps forward, takes the pipe from ANTON and gives it to
     TONY.

                            TONY
               Thank you.

     DR. PARNASSUS, who's been watching this exchange, looks
     thoughtful.

                                                                 60.




43   EXT   THE WAGON      NIGHT                                  43

     PARNASSUS and CO are preparing to move out and do a show.

     ANTON is working near PARNASSUS and PERCY who are unaware of
     his presence.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                What's eating Anton?

     ANTON pricks up his ears.

                          PERCY
                He's in love with Valentina?

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                    (dumbfounded)
                In love....?

                          PERCY
                It happens.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                The little snake! I'll skin him
                alive!

     CUT TO ANTON who winces.

                          PERCY
                While you're at it, don't forget
                the other one.

     DR. PARNASSUS looks at PERCY questioningly.

                          PERCY (CONT'D)
                The viper, the scorpion, the
                amnesiac boa constrictor. Tony.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                Quite another kettle of fish.

                            PERCY
                Really?

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                He's ambitious, energetic... a man
                of destiny.

                  souls.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  I think he might. Valentina sees
                  good in him.

                            PERCY
                  She'd be better off with Anton.

     CUT TO ANTON who's pleased.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Perhaps I should offer her hand to
                  whoever helps most in winning the
                  next five souls.

     CUT TO ANTON who looks puzzled.

                            PERCY
                  That's even worse than the other
                  ideas you've had today.

                            DR. PARNASSUS

                  You're not wrong... Ah, Percy, what
                  would I do without you?

                            PERCY
                  Get a midget.

44   EXT   OUTSIDE PUB       NIGHT                              44

     The theatre, parked outside a pub, is up and running.

     ANTON, as Mercury, is doing his pitch.

                               ANTON
                  Sleep no more. Procrastinate no
                  longer. Embrace this once in a life-
                  time opportunity. Let the mind of
                  Doctor Parnassus be the portal to
                  the infinite world of your
                  imagination.

     Behind the curtain, PERCY is signalling VALENTINA to see if
     DOCTOR PARNASSUS has been drinking. She sniffs him.


                                                         (CONTINUED)

44   CONTINUED:                                                  44


                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  What are you doing? Please
                  concentrate. We've got a tremendous
                  amount of work to do tonight. A
                  great deal depends on it.

     A roll on the drums from PERCY. The curtain rises. DOCTOR
     PARNASSUS `floats' above the stage on his glass plinth.

                            ANTON
                  As old as the universe itself, the
                  great Doctor, versed in every
                  mystic practice known to man, and
                  many more besides, will guide you
                  to your destiny.

     However, the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who
     have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - aren't much
     interested in ANTON. Instead they pay more attention to the
     masked TONY who, decked out in a stylish costume, is working
     the sparse crowd with his smooth charm.

     ANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is
     worried about the lack of customers.

     TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at one
     of his jokes. One pretty young woman, SALLY, in particular
     seems to be smitten by the handsome `actor'. TONY smiles
     seductively at her.

     The sight provokes ANTON. He leaps off the stage, grabs SALLY
     by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage.

     PERCY keeps playing.

                            SALLY
                      (laughing)
                  What?... Hey, what you doing?

                            ANTON
                  T-taking you to the heart of your
                  imagination!

     ANTON is trying to compete with TONY but just can't manage
     the charm.

                            SALLY
                      (good humoured)
                  Oh my god! No way!

                            ANTON
                  You won't regret it!

                   (indicating friend)

     A few ONLOOKERS cheer.

                         ANTON
               N-not at the same time!

     ANTON is still pulling SALLY onto the stage.

                         SALLY
               I'm not going on my own.

                          ANTON
               Your imagination is a very special
               place. Doctor Parnassus will make
               it flower.

                         SALLY
               I bet he will.

     More laughs.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               We'll do it together.

     More laughs.

                         ANTON
                   (shakes his head)
               No. T-two c-competing imaginations
               in the Imaginarium at the same
               time... it's n-not advisable.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               Eh?

                         ANTON
               The stronger imagination will
               overcome the weaker and then
               there's n-no knowing what might
               happen.

               Let go!

               D-don't be afraid, d-dear lady.
               You'll be safe with me.

     Anton sweeps her off her feet and carries her onto the stage.

                         SALLY
               Put me down!

                         ANTON
               Have no fear.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               She doesn't want to do it on her
               own!

               Let go of her you silly pillock!

     VALENTINA, worried, steps forward to try and restrain ANTON.

               Anton...

                         ANTON
               It's alright! It's alright!

     Staggering under the weight of the struggling SALLY, ANTON
     barges into DOCTOR PARNASSUS' on his glass plinth.

     The plinth rocks and teeters. VALENTINA tries to stop it
     falling.

     ANTON, unaware of what he's done, disappears through the
     mirror as DOCTOR PARNASSUS crashes head first onto the stage.
     Crack!

     From behind the mirror comes the sound of a woman's
     terrifying, terrified screams.

     Upstage VALENTINA tends the stunned DOCTOR. He clutches his
     head in pain.

               Father! Father!


45   INT/EXT   THE MIND OF DR. PARNASSUS   THAT MOMENT            45

     Terrified, ANTON and the screaming SALLY are spun through a
     black void clinging desperately to an asteroid as planets and
     stars spin madly around them.

     Blood-red lightning bolts crackle and crash. Chaos.


46   EXT   OUTSIDE PUB   THAT MOMENT                              46

     Out front, the CROWD, larger now, is reacting badly to the
     dreadful screams. Sally's friends try to storm the stage.

     TONY and PERCY try to hold them back.

                         TONY
               Please. Everything's alright. It's
               okay. Really. I promise you.

     A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN hits him with her handbag.

     TONY and PERCY are in danger of being overwhelmed. We can
     still hear Sally screaming from somewhere within the stage.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and
               gentlemen....please...

     A DRUNK takes a swing at PERCY, misses, and connects with
     TONY.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Ugh!

     He falls off the stage and disappears into the angry CROWD
     who begin pummelling and kicking him.

     PERCY, desperate, produces a pistol and fires a couple of
     shots into the air.

     EVERYONE dives for cover.

     PERCY, taking advantage of the temporary lull, begins to race
     around, untying, unhooking, and pulling on ropes.

     The theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the
     wagon clatters off down the street, bits falling off as it
     goes.

                            VOICE IN CROWD
                  Somebody call the police!

     A battered TONY, chased by the enraged crowd,just manages to
     clamber on board, with the help of VALENTINA.

     The wagon narrowly succeeds in out-pacing the fastest of the
     CROWD. As it disappears down the street, a figure is dumped
     unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon.

     It's the terrified SALLY, sent sprawling in the middle of the
     road.

     A figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet.
     It's MR. NICK in his bowler and red waistcoat.


47   EXT.   RUBBISH TIP      NIGHT                                47

     A police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the
     corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt... the
     horses steaming, sections of the theatre hanging loose,
     broken..an utter mess. The siren fades into the distance.


48   INT/EXT   THEATRE/WAGON      NIGHT                           48

     Amongst collapsed scenery PARNASSUS lies in a heap. The
     others are struggling to their feet. ANTON is desperately
     trying to do something useful to help PARNASSUS but,
     VALENTINA pushes him out of the way.

                            VALENTINA
                  What were you thinking? Look what
                  you've done. Get out of the way!
                      (appealing to Tony)
                  Tony.

     TONY, battered and bleeding, helps her lift PARNASSUS and
     manoeuvre him to his room.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

     ANTON is mortified.      PERCY pats him on the back.

                            PERCY
                  Better luck next time.


49   INT    PARNASSUS' ROOM    NIGHT                               49

     TONY helps VALENTINA get PARNASSUS comfortable.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (babbling)
                  This is my punishment. All is lost.
                  First to Five. One down.
                  Impossible, Valentina. First to
                  five. One down. No people. No time,
                  Valentina. We are doomed.

                            VALENTINA
                      (very concerned)
                  Ssshhhh... Thanks, Tony. Leave us.

     TONY, nods, leaves slowly. Listening.


50   EXT.    WAGON    NIGHT                                        50

     PERCY is angrily banging about, trying to repair the damage.
     ANTON is trying to help but, is just getting in the way.

                            PERCY
                  Do me a favour. Take a long walk
                  off a short pier.

     TONY arrives.

                            TONY
                  Can I help?

                            PERCY
                  Bugger off!

     TONY finds ANTON sitting despondently a short way from the
     wagon swigging from a bottle. He sits down next to him.

                            ANTON
                  L-leave me alone.

                            TONY
                  What were you doing to that girl
                  behind the mirror?

                      (incensed)
                  What are you suggesting?

                             TONY
                  Oh, c'mon...we all heard her
                  screaming.

                            ANTON
                  I was screaming as well.   It was t-
                  terrifying...

                            TONY
                  Terrifying? Why? I don't
                  understand.

                            ANTON
                      (reluctantly)
                  No, well...you wouldn't. You've n-
                  never been inside the D-Doctor's
                  mind have you?

                            TONY
                  Your not trying to tell me that
                  mind control stuff is real?

                            ANTON
                  You think it's some k-kind of scam,
                  d-don't you?

                              TONY
                  Isn't it?

                            ANTON
                  No... But I d-don't expect you to g-
                  get it... N-not in a million years.

                            TONY
                  Hang on.. if he can really control
                  people's minds, why isn't he ruling
                  the world? Why bother with this
                  crappy side show?

                            ANTON
                  He d-doesn't want to rule the world
                  d-does he?... He wants the world to
                  rule itself!

                            TONY
                  What a waste... Tell me about the
                  mirror. What's the point of that,
                  if not to razzle-dazzle the public?

                    (smiles sardonically)
                You're way off the mark.
                    (taking a swig)
                It's a b-bloody great mystery...
                wrapped in a b-brown p-paper b-bag
                enema...or do I mean, enigma...

     He pulls himself up and starts to stagger off.

                          TONY
                Er... one more thing....Does `first
                to five' mean anything to you?

     ANTON looks at TONY with loathing.

                          ANTON
                I thought you were the c-clever
                one.

     He walks away into the darkness.

     TONY sits there busily thinking.


51   EXT    RUBBISH TIP    DAWN                                51

     The morning light suffuses mountains of domestic refuse.
     Rubbish for as far as the eye can see. Plastic sacks of
     various colours, many spilling open. A few fires are burning.

     Flocks of scavenging sea gulls hover and dive, screaming blue
     murder.

     On one of the many pinnacles of garbage sits a lonely figure.
     It's ANTON, depressed, angry, forlorn.

     The CAMERA SWINGS ROUND to show, below ANTON, in a valley of
     waste material, the wagon.


52   EXT.   THE WAGON     DAWN                                 52

     PERCY has spread out the broken scenery assessing the damage.
     In the shadow of the wagon VALENTINA is changing TONY'S
     dressings.

                          VALENTINA
                Thank God it's only cuts and
                bruises. I thought we'd lost you.

                  If you hadn't been there...

     He holds her hand.    Looks deep into her eyes.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                  Valentina, your father seems in a
                  terrible state. Is it the police?
                  The show? Maybe I can help.

                            VALENTINA
                  I don't know what's wrong with him,
                  but if it's about the show...I
                  don't care. I'm tired of it...let
                  the police arrest us. I'm sick of
                  living like this....

     She looks miserable. TONY puts his arms around her.   Holds
     her tightly to him.

                            TONY
                  Don't say that. What you're doing
                  is important. Really important.
                  It's just... maybe... it should be
                  done in a different way.

     He is about to kiss her.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
                  What sort of "different" way do you
                  suggest?

     DR. PARNASSUS, grim faced, head bandaged, steps from behind
     the wagon.

     TONY and VALENTINA quickly disengage.

                            TONY
                  Oh, hello, good morning sir. How
                  are you feeling? That was a nasty
                  bump on the head you got..

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
                      (beady eyed)
                  "Different?"

                            TONY
                  Well, sir, I've been thinking...
                  It's clear the show's not
                  attracting many people. Forgive me
                  but... I see two ways of tackling
                  this problem.

               Either the style of the show is at
               fault... or the type of audience. I
               would suggest changing both.

     PERCY has appeared, dragging a damaged flat.

                         PERCY
               Change the show!? Who the fizzing
               hell do you think you are?......

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Shhh!

     He sits down heavily.

                         TONY
               I'm sorry but.. you're not modern.
               People want modern. Look.

     He holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of
     beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical
     setting. He thumbs through more pages of dreamy images.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               This is modern. It works. Trust me,
               I understand this world.
                   (with a wink)
               This kind of mind control. Let's
               try to meet the public halfway..
               the right public.. and in a better
               part of town.

     From behind the wagon ANTON watches forlornly.   Alone and
     unnoticed by the others.

                         PERCY
               What about the filth?

               What?

                         PERCY
               The filth. The police.

                         TONY
               There'll be a better class of
               police too.

                         PERCY
               That'll be the day.

                The trick is not to hide. Change
                your colours. Be bold. Go where
                they would least expect to find
                you. I think we have been brought
                together for a reason. I don't
                believe in coincidence. You saved
                my life. Now let me do something
                in return.

     PARNASSUS confers with PERCY.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                Our time's nearly up... This could
                be what we need.

                           TONY
                    (to Valentina)
                This can be my birthday gift to
                Valentina.

     VALENTINA smiles and nods to PARNASSUS.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                Well then...
                    (with a burst of energy)
                For God's sake let's do it!!!

                Yeah, okay, but what exactly do we

                          TONY
                Well... First of all, I want you to
                give me your money. All of it.

     What?!   PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each other.

     Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON,
     downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and
     flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand.

                           DR. PARNASSUS
                Anton!   Where are you going?

     No answer from ANTON.

     VALENTINA runs after him but, he marches on silently.

                         VALENTINA
               What are you doing? Didn't you do
               enough damage last night?
                   (pummmelling his back)
               Anton... I'm the one who wants to
               run away!
                   (he slows)
               Are you trying to wreck my
               birthday, or what?

     Anton stops, still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops
     his suitcase.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               Please. We need you.

     Moved, ANTON turns to her.   She smiles sweetly.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               How much money have you got?


53   EXT   BOND STREET   EVENING                                  53

     Close up on Parnassus's glass plinth..now open-topped and
     sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's
     savings. A sign proclaims "Please Take Generously"

     Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the
     continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy
     playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one
     hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's
     blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He
     sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money.

     The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and
     white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable
     street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN
     anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth
     glide past.

     New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium -
     More Exclusive than ever'.

     The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been
     chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other
     white.

     On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast
     quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is,
     in fact, a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

     Center stage stands DR. PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized
     doctor with head reflector. In his hand is a staff with an
     elaborate sun on the top. He is blindfolded.

     On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a
     stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the
     tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as
     Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty.
     She gracefully combs her hair.

     Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth".

     DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly
     uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire.

     TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his
     `romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy
     pose on the edge of the white side of the stage.

     Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd.

     A few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money
     and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go.

                            TONY
                      (retrieving the money)
                  Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we
                  can't accept this.

     The woman stops, confused. Tony hands her back her money.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                  We are here to give...not take. We
                  are here to help those in need. If
                  it's money you need, then here it
                  is.
                      (referring to the glass
                       plinth)
                  If it's the flowering of the soul
                  you need, then here we are but,
                  unfortunately we are booked solid
                  at the moment. But thank you.. I
                  can see you have a generous spirit.

     TONY returns to his pensive pose.    The women look at each
     other.

                            WOMAN
                  Excuse me but, how does this work?
                  What does it cost?

               Cost? Money is no good in the
               Imaginarium.   This is a refuge for
               hearts in need of truth. A place
               for souls to be purified.

                         WOMAN 2
               How long does that take?   I'm
               running late.

                         TONY
               Madam, why should you care about
               time? What are your dreams worth in
               minutes?

     The women grow pensive.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               There are hard choices to be made
               in life.
                   (he indicates the
                    tableaux)
               What about the dreams of the less
               fortunate in the world. Do you
               have time for their dreams? Or are
               you like I once was...do you just
               despair? Despair at all that is
               wrong in the world..
                   (getting to his feet)
               ...despair at your inability to do
               anything to change it.. to make it
               better...I despaired so much at the
               powerlessness of my own existence
               that I took the easy way out...the
               coward's way...I committed suicide!
               Yes, that's right, I killed myself.
               Can you understand my despair? But
               I was saved...saved by a
               miracle...The Imaginarium...and
               Doctor Parnassus. He brought me
               back from the dead. He gave me a
               new life. A reason to live. He has
               given me power to dream again... to
               dream of a better world.

     During his speech, more and more people have gathered. Some
     are actually weeping. They are press forward putting money
     in the plinth. Tony tries to stop them but, they insist.
     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY, and DR. PARNASSUS are astonished by
     TONY'S performance.

               Please, I'm sorry but, we're booked
               solid at the moment.

     A Louis Vuitton-dressed woman (60+ years old)at the back of
     the crowd shouts:

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               Is that child up for adoption?

     She points at the blacked up PERCY.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
               I want to adopt that unfortunate
               black child. It shouldn't be
               working like this. It should be in
               school.

     PERCY is appalled.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
               Who's in charge here?

     The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN looks around as a couple of POLICE
     OFFICERS arrive on the scene.

     TONY spots them too and heads off the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN as
     she makes towards them.

                         TONY
               Madam, congratulations, you have
               been chosen.

     The other WOMEN gasp.

                          LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               What?

                         TONY
               Come forward and enter the
               Imaginarium.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               But, I haven't paid.

               We don't want your money. We want
               your hopes and dreams. You may make
               a donation later, if you wish.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               But...

                         TONY
               This is a rare moment. Very few are
               chosen. Don't miss this once-in-a-
               life-time opportunity. This way.
               Please.

     He ushers the uneasy LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN onto the stage and
     guides her upstage. PARNASSUS goes into his trance.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Believe me Madam, you're the
               luckiest woman in the world.

     The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN steps into the mirror. TONY
     hesitates..a moment of uncertainty. VALENTINA encourages him
     with a smile. He steps through.

     Across the street a clock begins striking the hour.

     CUT TO the two POLICE OFFICERS who start to move the crowd
     and show on.

                          POLICEMAN
               Alright, I think it's time to move
               on, folks.

     But on spotting the naked VALENTINA who winks at them, they
     agree between themselves to give the show a bit longer.


54   INT/EXT   IMAGINARIUM                                        54

     TONY and THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN are astonished to find
     themselves in the romantic, soft-focus, pastel-colour setting
     of a soothing, sophisticated, shampoo commercial.

     Soft fabrics waft, cleansing waterfalls cascade, rose-petals
     float through the air, beautiful girls swing from swings
     attached to clouds - all in delicious slow motion.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                   (overcome)
               Oh... how gorgeous...

     THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN takes TONY'S hand and looks at him
     meaningfully.

     TONY, disorientated, takes a moment to regain his composure.
     He smiles and, with an effort, puts his arm around THE LOUIS
     VUITTON WOMAN'S wide waist. He looks into her eyes. She's in
     love.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
                      (moans softly)
                  Ohhh... What bliss... and I don't
                  even know your name...

                            TONY
                  Tony...

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                  Tony. How dashing.

     A bar or two of tango encourages them to take a couple of
     intimate tango dance steps.

     Now gently wafting curtains part to reveal.. down a flower
     strewn path and over a bridge... a sleazy motel with a
     shingle over the door reads: "The One Night Stand Motel". In
     the office window sits MR. NICK

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  Oh, goodness me!

     She bats her eyelashes at TONY and begins, knowingly, to pull
     him towards the motel.

                            TONY
                      (resisting)
                  If I'm not wrong, I fear you must
                  go alone.

     THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN pouts playfully, pulling him onwards.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                  Why would I want to go without you
                  darling?

                            TONY
                  It's one of the rules... One
                  imagination at a time, free from
                  the influence of another.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                      (petulant)
                  Boring.

     They have reached the bridge. Stairs descend to a stream.

                         TONY
               Oh..look... another possibility..

     Below them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower
     bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic
     heroes who died young; Keats, Shelly, Byron, James Dean,
     Rudolph Valentino, Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Princess
     Diana... the stream continues off into the distance to a
     dark, towering Egyptian pyramid.

     TONY is as bemused as THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               You must make a choice...and...
               actually, to be honest, I'd
               strongly recommend this one.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               But... Rudolph Valentino, James
               Dean, Princess Di?... all these
               people... they're dead.

                         TONY
                   (thinking fast)
               Exactly. To be reborn, first you
               must die. All of them have achieved
               a kind of immortality. And we love
               them all the more for it. They
               won't get old or fat. They won't
               get sick or feeble. They are beyond
               fear. They are forever young. They
               are gods. And you can join them.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                   (softening)
               You're such a wonderful speaker.

     The gondola awaits....with a beautiful male model at the
     helm. THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN smiles at him.

                         TONY
               There's not a moment to lose.

     But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. TONY,
     looking past the WOMAN"S shoulder, sees the dark waters of
     the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBRA
     that towers menacingly over them. It's wearing a BOWLER
     HAT... and it's angry.

                But your sacrifice must be pure.
                You have to let go of all these
                worldly goods.

     He helps THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN remove her necklace,
     earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time and
     guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
                Remember nothing is permanent...
                not even death.

     He turns back to see the GIGANTIC KING COBRA shrinking back
     below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of
     the stream. From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope.
     At its end.. a hangman's noose.

     TONY stares at it darkly disconcerted.


55   EXT.   STAGE     EVENING                                  55

     TONY re-enters the stage through the mirror, looking at DR.
     PARNASSUS who has just come out of his trance with
     astonishment

                          TONY
                    (gobsmacked)
                That was so... I had no idea...
                It's just... incredible.

     ...And then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour
     realizing that only a few moments have passed since he
     entered the mirror.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
                ..how do you do this?

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                    (ignoring him and with a
                     big theatrical gesture)
                Hooplah!

     The LOUIS VUITTON woman reappears, sitting on a cut-out cloud
     descending from the ceiling of the stage. She looks radiant.

     She is weeping, completely overcome by her experience.
     PARNASSUS steps forward and helps her to her feet. She kisses
     his hands in gratitude.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                  Thank you, thank you, that was so
                  beautiful, I feel so... thank you so
                  much...

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (graciously)
                  Thank YOU, dear Lady, you give me
                  strength to continue

     Born again, tearful but transcendent, the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
     produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque.

     TONY is frozen, confused. The crowd is still... stunned by
     the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits the
     cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and
     glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe.

     Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is
     narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into
     a more-or-less orderly queue.

     Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling
     luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued...

     ...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a
     third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their
     handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the
     glass box.

     TONY pays off the cops who move on.

     TONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his
     mask each time he re-enters the stage. And now a fourth woman
     descends. Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (aside to Percy)
                  One more to go and we're free.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street, smiles,
     holds up four fingers.

     MR NICK gives a little `I'm not impressed' smirk and turns
     away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the
     shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN, all laden
     with luxury shopping walk past.

     One of the RUSSIANS stops..looking at the show..at TONY whose
     mask is sitting on top of his head. The leading RUSSIAN
     pulls him on.

               C'mon..What are you watching that
               crap for.

                         SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)
                   (pointing at TONY)
               It's him!

                         VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN)
               Who are you talking about?
                   (following SERGE's pointed
                    finger)
               Impossible.

                           SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)
               I'm sure.

     They start pushing through the crowd.

     TONY, reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage,
     looks up and sees the RUSSIANS heading through the crowd..

     Panic!! He pulls the mask down and begins to back up.

     But it's too late, they've definitely seen him.

     He spins around and rockets upstage, past DR. PARNASSUS who
     is deep into his trance.

     TONY dives through the mirror much to the amazement of
     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY.

     The RUSSIANS chase after him, shoving the queuing WOMEN
     aside, smashing the scenery and knocking ANTON into the
     wings.


56   INT/EXT   SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE                    56

     The RUSSIANS charge through the shampoo-commercial landscape.
     No TONY.. Just slo-mo fashion models and soft wafting fabrics
     and aromatic breezes.

                         VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN)
               Where did he go?

                         PIOTR (IN RUSSIAN)
               You tell me... It can't be him.
               He's dead. We killed him.

                         SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)
               So why did he run?

                            GREGOR (IN RUSSIAN)
                  There he is!!

     In the distance, TONY is hiding behind some billowing fabric.
     On being spotted, he takes off up a hill.

     The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a solid
     wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid stride.
     Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up another
     hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall rises
     up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY
     frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up..
     surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS.

     There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they
     start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it
     down. It won't budge.

     While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been
     somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits
     quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers.

     Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground.

     GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and
     exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS
     gape at him... then barrel out the door.

     Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with
     white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud
     is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person
     climbing upwards.

     The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a
     ladder and climbing.

     Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper-
     active, wide-eyed sales girl.

                            SALES-GIRL

     The RUSSIANS roughly shove her aside.     As they rush past,
     GREGOR pauses, hands her his flowers.

                            GREGOR
                  Relax...smell the flowers.

     Reaching the base of TONY'S ladder, the RUSSIANS start
     climbing.

     Seeing the threat, TONY kicks hard and breaks the rungs below
     him.. setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking
     downward towards the RUSSIANS. Snap! Crack! Rungs break in
     their grasp.. they fall.

     The RUSSIANS land in a tangled heap as the domino effect
     continues down to the base of the ladder.

     Laughing down at them, TONY turns to continue climbing - only
     to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the
     ladder... towards him.

     THE LADDER COMPLETELY SEPARATES IN TWO.

     Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages
     to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung. Then, as
     if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away.

     The RUSSIANS chase after him but, his giant strides leave
     them far behind. Smugly, TONY looks back just as one of the
     legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log. He loses his
     balance... and plunges hundreds of feet earthward.

     From nowhere, ANTON (still dressed as a fat woman) appears..
     running to catch the plummeting TONY. He does and Whomp!!..
     is flattened. Knocked out cold. TONY is unscathed.. his fall
     broken by ANTON'S padding.

     But, the RUSSIANS arrive, grab TONY, start to beat him up.

                          SERGE
               You thieving scumbag! We break
               every bone in your body!

     They scrawl strange symbols on TONY'S forehead.

                         TONY
               No! Wait! I can explain! Give me a
               chance!

                         VLADIMIR
               We want our money or you die again!
               This time for good!

     ANTON struggles to his feet.

                         ANTON
               Stop it! L-leave him alone!

     The RUSSIANS turn and, thinking ANTON is a fat, bossy, middle-
     aged woman, hesitate.

                         ANTON (CONT'D)
               Stand b-back! I'm warning you!

     Foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial
     arts pose. The RUSSIANS look at each other. Then, utterly
     ignoring ANTON, turn their attention back to beating TONY.

     GREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode.

                         GREGOR
                   (bending down and picking
                    a flower, he offers it to
                    ANTON)
               Relax. Smell the flowers.

     Confused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREGOR
     floors him with a powerful punch on the nose

     Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and
     have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to
     pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck.
     He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when...

     ... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet
     rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves -
     revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath.

     The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a
     welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling
     policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in..

     The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope.

     TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe
     flies out of his mouth.

     Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads
     "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of
     LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear -
     high-kicking a snappy song and dance number.

     The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on.

     Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting
     something in Russian.

     Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian
     grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to
     them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.

                           RUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN)
                Mama!   Mama! Help! Save us!

     As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. She
     lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. And
     then.. BOOM!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts
     outward. Smoke spews out from below.

     Straightening her skirt, the BABOUSHKA looks up, and pulls
     off her head - revealing MR.NICK's tiny head poking out of
     the collar. He smiles smugly.

     The giant POLICEMAN DR. PARNASSUS registers disappointment
     and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky
     sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything.

     The dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves in a
     desolate, empty landscape. Nowhere. Nothing.

                          TONY
                Did you see me!! I almost reached
                the clouds! I could have...it was
                incredible...I was almost there...

                           ANTON
                Shut up!

     Over a distant rise the wagon appears, pulled by the horses.
     ANTON drags Tony, babbling and stumbling, towards it.

                          TONY
                I made my choice and I climbed... I
                felt so much potential. I could
                have done anything. I have to have
                another chance...another go...I
                need this...


57   EXT   SOMEWHERE DOWN RIVER - MUD FLATS   EVENING             57

     The wagon is parked on waste ground. It looms out of nowhere
     illuminated by a light leaking from within.

     We hear PERCY'S angry voice.

                          PERCY O/S
                Maybe you were holding them upside

58   INT   THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                                58

     The angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and
     jumbled scenery. TONY is on trial.

     DR. PARNASSUS is sitting in a corner, head in hands. He seems
     utterly destroyed.

                            ANTON
                  You're a l-liar. You've been lying
                  to us all along. Who are you? Who
                  were those thugs?

                            TONY
                  I am not a liar!

                            ANTON
                  No?

                            TONY
                  No! I just... didn't divulge
                  everything I knew.

                            PERCY
                  Comes to the same thing.

                            TONY
                  Absolutely not. Not in law.

                            ANTON
                  You stole their money.

                            TONY
                  No. I didn't.

                            ANTON
                  That's what they said.

                  Are you going to believe them

                             PERCY
                  Why not?

                            TONY
                  Because they're irredeemably bad
                  people, and I'm essentially good. I
                  know that sounds terribly prim and
                  arrogant and self righteous, but
                  I'm trying to be honest. Look, the
                  truth is... in order to get my
                  charity off the ground I needed
                  capital.

     ANTON looks askance.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                      (in response to Anton)
                  Yes, I know, and you're right, but
                  that's the way the grown-up..the
                  real world works. You can't make
                  omelettes without soiling your
                  hands. Or should that be the other
                  way round? Anyway, I - with
                  hindsight very foolishly - accepted
                  a loan from people who seemed to
                  me, at the time, to be very decent
                  and sincere. There was absolutely
                  no way I could have known that they
                  were part of a ruthless organised
                  crime syndicate and that they
                  wanted to use my charity to launder
                  money. I made a mistake. And I have
                  to live with that. I'm sorry. What
                  more can I say?

     VALENTINA wants to believe TONY. ANTON and PERCY don't.

                            VALENTINA
                      (distressed but basically
                       sympathetic)
                  Oh Tony.

                            TONY
                  But, can we not talk about me for a
                  moment.. I want to thank the Doctor
                  for letting me experience the most
                  sublime, inspiring ....

                         ANTON
               So why were they trying to k-kill
               you? "Again!" is what they said.

                         TONY
               What?

                         ANTON
                   (answering his own
                    question)
               The first time they hung you from
               the b-bridge... right?... B-because
               you stole their money.

                         TONY
               Stop saying that! I didn't steal
               it! I didn't have it. I'd had to
               invest in infrastructure. I needed
               more time. When you run a charity
               you have to give lots of money
               away. You wouldn't believe the red
               tape. The Charity Commission are a
               bunch of fascists. It's incredible.
               I mean... c'mon give me a break...I
               almost died today.. and I said I'm
               sorry... and anyway..... this was
               supposed to be a special day...it's
               Valentina's birthday.

     He pulls out the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN'S beautiful necklace
     from his pocket.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Happy birthday. For a beautiful
               woman.

     He puts it around Valentina's neck. VALENTINA smiles.   ANTON
     glowers.

                         ANTON
               The marks on your face...

                         TONY
               Marks?

                         ANTON
               They scrawled something on your
               forehead. Symbols... Signs...

     TONY looks uncomfortable, tries to rub his forehead clean.

               You had some of those when we
               rescued you.

                         ANTON
               Yes, what's that about?

     But, before he can say anything, there's a knock on the door
     which startles everyone. They exchange looks.

     DR. PARNASSUS is frightened but hides this from the others.

     The knock is repeated. PERCY starts to get up.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (sotto voce)
               No! Leave it!

     PERCY sits down.

     The knock comes again.

                   (sotto voce)
               It's too late... for visitors.

     Once more someone knocks. Everyone is edgy. Particularly
     PERCY.

     The knock comes again.

                         PERCY
                   (sotto voce, agitated)
               Please can we answer the door? I
               can't stand not answering the door,
               or the telephone, or whatever. It's
               not in my nature. I won't sleep for
               weeks if we don't answer the door!
               Sorry!

     DR. PARNASSUS gets up, goes to the door, opens it and steps
     outside, closing the door behind him.

     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY and TONY exchange looks.

59   EXT   OUTSIDE THE WAGON    THAT MOMENT                       59

     DR. PARNASSUS and MR NICK move away from the door and go
     around to the front. The stage is half-opened.

     The horses are standing steaming nearby.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (very down)
               I know... It's over....you've
               won...

                         MR NICK
               Four rotten Russkies?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               And the girl..from the pub.

     MR NICK shakes his head.

                         MR NICK
               Sally doesn't count.    Do you, gal?

     SALLY (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped
     from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows, puts her arms
     around NICK

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               You're joking... toying with me.
               Like a cat with a mouse... As is
               your privilege.

                         MR NICK
               Sal didn't get to make a real
               choice. You were gaga. Out for the
               count. Wouldn't be fair...And
               you've got four, thanks to your
               friend Tony. So... we're even...
               it's not quite over.

     He smiles, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag...

                          MR NICK (CONT'D)
               Not quite.
                   (checks his watch)
               Oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11.

     ...and he wanders off into the darkness with SALLY.
     Somewhere, a clock strikes 11.

     DR. PARNASSUS, agitated, watches him go.

                               VALENTINA (V.O.)
                  Father?

     DR. PARNASSUS looks round to find VALENTINA standing next to
     him. He starts to round up the horses.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Valentina... my darling girl. We
                  must do another show! Now! Quickly!
                  Get ready to move out!

                            VALENTINA
                  Who was that?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Somebody asking the way. Where's
                  Tony?

                            VALENTINA
                  I overheard you... He wasn't asking
                  the way.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Please! Get everybody together.
                  Another show! Tony! Percy!

                            VALENTINA

                            VALENTINA
                  Yes, now! I want to know the truth!

               It's something to do with that
               bloody rambling story you were
               telling me the night we found Tony
               isn't it?

     PARNASSUS sighs. Stops. He checks his watch

               Yes.

                         VALENTINA
               So tell me.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               What I told you was... the truth.
               I really am thousands of years old.
               I have been immortal. I have been
               mortal. And I have had many
               dealings with the devil. Too many.

                         VALENTINA
                   (fearful)
               What are you saying?...

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Remember the woman I was telling
               you about?.. the one I was so
               desperately in love with.. so in
               love that I made a deal with the
               devil? That was your mother...
               ...she was so beautiful, so
               enchanting...so...

     Looking at VALENTINA, DR. PARNASSUS sees her morph into the
     BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing. He almost swoons.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               ... so young. She was everything I
               had ever dreamed of. I made a
               choice. I bargained away my
               immortality. I regained my youth...
               and I won her. I did! I won her...!

     The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN morphs back into VALENTINA.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               ...but at a price...

     DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and
     loses his balance.

               would, on their sixteenth

               I don't believe this! It can't be

               wagers!... You're beneath contempt.

     She rushes off into the dark night.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
               Valentina! That's not true! It's
               not like that! Wait! Come back!
               Valentina!

     A dark silhouette stands in the shadow of the wagon. It's
     TONY. What has he heard?

                                                                96.




60   INT   THE WAGON     MOMENTS LATER                          60

     DR. PARNASSUS rushes into the wagon.

     PERCY is already on his feet, having heard the DOCTOR
     shouting.

                         ANTON
               What's happened?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Valentina... She's... she's gone...

     ANTON rushes out.

     PERCY stops by DR. PARNASSUS before he exits.

                         PERCY
               Telling the truth... Always a bad
               idea.


61   EXT   MONTAGE OF SCENES   NIGHT                            61

     ANTON, running, calling for VALENTINA.

     PERCY is scouring the area on horseback.

     ANTON running though a newspaper-filled tip, sees a headline
     on one of the newspapers. Stops.


62   EXT   THE WAGON     A LITTLE LATER                         62

     PARNASSUS, a bottle in his hand, is lurching around.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               You fool! You monstrous fool!    You
               should be dead.

     He starts to violently bang his head against the side of the
     wagon.

     Suddenly the stage begins to unfold. PARNASSUS looks up,
     unable to see what or who is doing this. He drunkenly
     stumbles around the side to see TONY pulling ropes.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               What are you doing?

                            TONY
                  Saving Valentina.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (befuddled)
                  What?... How?

                            TONY
                  I overheard you. You only need one
                  more to win. Me! I'll be that one.
                  I'll take the risk to save
                  Valentina and, hopefully, you sir.
                  We've still got a few minutes.

     Tony steers DOCTOR PARNASSUS towards his glass column.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Yes! Yes! Of course! Of course!
                  Thank God! Thank God!

                            TONY
                      (to himself)
                  How about thanking me?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  What?

                            TONY
                  I expect nothing in return.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (trying to go into a
                       trance)
                  No. You're a saint... A saint.

                            TONY
                  Only Valentina's hand in marriage,
                  if she'll have me...

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (not listening)
                  Oh, my head...

                            TONY
                  And, as your son-in-law...
                  perhaps... initiation into the
                  secrets of the trance.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  No! I can't do it!

                    referring to his
                    inability to go into a
                    trance)
               Why not?! What's wrong?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               My mind... I can't concentrate...
               I'm too upset...

                         TONY
               You must do it! You have to do it!
               It's the only way to save your
               daughter!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (distraught)
               I know...

                         TONY
                   (sitting PARNASSUS down)
               Concentrate. You must concentrate.
                   (clearing the way to the
                    mirror)
               I'll make the right choice. I'm
               sure of it. I can feel how right it
               is already.

     TONY leaps back to steady DR. PARNASSUS who looked as though
     he were about to topple off his pillar.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Oh God!... Doctor... We can save
               her.. you and me. I need this. We
               both need this. Please. The trance.

     PARNASSUS quiets down.   Starts mumbling.

     TONY rushes to the mirror. Steps through. He finds himself
     standing amongst the stage scenery. Nothing else.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Bugger!

     He steps back out of the mirror.    Goes to PARNASSUS who is
     weeping.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               It's no good!

     TONY shakes him hard.

                         TONY
               PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!... Sir.
               Concentrate...or you'll have lost
               her forever.

     PARNASSUS slowly goes into a sobbing kind of trance state.

     TONY confirms he is in a trance, then rushes to the mirror.

                         VALENTINA O/S
               Tony...oh, Tony..

     What?! TONY stops. Looks around. There in the shadows
     huddles VALENTINA, sobbing.

                         VALENTINA
                   (sobbing)
               It's useless... Hopeless... I
               thought I was strong, but I don't
               even know how to run away...

     TONY hesitates.. No time! He looks back to PARNASSUS who
     seems to still be in his trance. Hesitates. Then rushes to
     VALENTINA.

                         TONY
               It's alright... it's alright...
               Don't cry. It's going to be
               alright, believe me.

                         VALENTINA
               This stupid theatre...!... That's
               all I've ever known...! I've
               always believed it was something
               precious, but it's not... it's a
               lie...I hate it!

     TONY lifts her up, putting his arm around her.

                         TONY
               Everything's going to be alright...
               I'll take you away. I'll show you
               the world. My world. The great big
               beautiful world I've always dreamed
               of... You'll love it.

     VALENTINA, grateful, clings to TONY.

               Maybe.

                         TONY
               C'mon then.

     They turn to the mirror but, an off-stage clearing of the
     throat makes them look round to see ANTON watching them. He's
     holding a torn and dirty piece of newspaper.

                         ANTON
               Ah, there you are, Tony. Here's
               something m-might interest you.
                   (reading)
               'Missing: D-disgraced head of
               children's charity'.

                            TONY
               No!

     TONY tries to snatch the paper but ANTON steps back.

                         ANTON
               N-not a bad p-picture, Tony.
               Listen to this Valentina... it's
               about Tony's b-beautiful world..

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
               Valentina!     Where are you?

     PARNASSUS is still in his trance but, mumbling.

                         ANTON
               ...Anthony Shepherd, who was
               arrested last week on charges of...

     VALENTINA is surrounded. Confused.

                         TONY
                   (to Valentina)
               Valentina, Don't listen to that.
               I'm innocent. This is the work of
               people who are trying to destroy
               me! Evil people! Believe me! Look,
               I'll show you the truth!

     TONY pulls VALENTINA towards the mirror.

     ANTON tries to stop him, but TONY pushes him back, off the
     stage. He crashes to the ground.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (grabbing VALENTINA)
               Hurry!

     TONY and VALENTINA disappear through the mirror.

                   (sobbing in his trance)
               Valentina! Forgive me.


63   INT/EXT   DR. PARNASSUS' DRUNKEN IMAGINATION                 63

     Mist and rain descend as TONY and VALENTINA run through the
     darkened shapes of the shampoo-commercial landscape - now
     tattered, ragged, and wind blown. Darkness reigns.

                         TONY
               This isn't right. This is all
               wrong. Which way?

     Soaked and cold they spy a welcome sight. A uniformed valet
     with an open umbrella stands by the door of a sleek limo.

                         VALET
               Your car is here, Mr.Tony.

                         TONY
               Ah, Lester, just in time.

     TONY ducks under the umbrella and helps VALENTINA into the
     car ahead of himself.

     As she slides across the seat she notices the driver - bowler
     hatted and smoking a cigarette.

                         VALENTINA
               No! Tony, don't get in! Get away!

     She pushes TONY back and scrambles out...dragging him back
     out into the dark rain.

     The driver turns around.   It's MR.NICK.. looking vexed.

     VALENTINA and TONY struggle through the rain. Suddenly, they
     find themselves in deep water up to their chests. They are
     sinking. Through the mist they see a boat. It is the gondola
     that transported the LOUIS VUITTON LADY.

                  Help! Over here!

     The boatman turns the boat in their direction. TONY tries to
     pull himself on board. The boatman reaches down to help.

                            BOATMAN
                  Give me your hand

     It's MR. NICK.    VALENTINA recoils, drags TONY off the boat.

                            TONY
                  Stop! What are you doing!   We'll
                  drown!

                            VALENTINA
                  No we won't. This is the way.

     She points to jumbled rocks just visible in the darkness.
     They drag themselves onto them. The rocky monoliths appear
     to be the same as the landscape ANTON climbed over when he
     was searching for DIEGO, the son of THE FAMILY FROM HELL.

     And, like a repeat of that experience, from behind the ridge
     rises the Parnassus-faced Mongolfier balloon. But, now the
     eyes stream tears and rain pours down. In the basket is
     ANTON.

                            ANTON
                  Don't d-do it. Don't g-go on. Not
                  with him! He's all lies.

                            VALENTINA
                  Just like my father. Leave me
                  alone. I don't care anymore. I want
                  a new life.

                            TONY
                  Valentina...

     He pulls her away..towards a little tumble-down cottage. Warm
     candlelight glows in the windows, smoke curls from the
     chimney. They run to the door. TONY bangs on it. Someone
     can be heard unlatching the locks inside.

     A child's crying cuts through the wind.

     VALENTINA turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path...
     among flapping laundry. She rushes to her, tries to pick her
     up but, the little girl resists..

               Tony, help me, she's heavy.

     The door has just opened and TONY is halfway through.    He
     turns, irritated.

                         TONY
               What is it now?! Can't we just go
               inside and get dry.

     Behind him, in the warmth, stands the old BABOUSHKA.

     Seeing that VALENTINA is really struggling with the little
     girl, TONY reluctantly goes to help. The little girl, on
     seeing TONY, tries to break away but, he holds on to her.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (shouting angrily)
               Ostanobuite bas menshi schit!

     The litle girl goes quiet. VALENTINA looks at TONY with
     surprise. The BABOUSHKA looks angry. Suddenly a light begins
     to suffuse TONY and the little girl. A small orchestra can
     be heard playing garden party music.

                         VALENTINA
               You did it! You made the right
               choice!

     The light fills the screen and we find...

     ...TONY, sleekly groomed and immaculately dressed, holding
     the smiling little girl. She too has been cleaned and
     buffed. The sun shines. He stands in...

     ...a large well kept lawn covered with smart guests, BUSINESS
     PEOPLE, POLITICIANS, POP STARS, CELEBS...

     Behind and beyond them is an impressive country house.

     A small orchestra is playing. There is a marquee.

     WAITERS and WAITRESSES move amongst the assembled notables
     bearing trays of drinks and food.

     TONY is the focus of attention. A TV current-affairs/news
     JOURNALIST with CAMERA CREW is following him around.

                            TONY
                  Sustainability's great, if you can
                  achieve it. The problem is, in many
                  cases you simply can't, for a whole
                  variety of reasons.

     TONY smiles and shakes the hand of someone in a wheelchair.

     A GROUP OF GUESTS burst into spontaneous applause. Everybody
     loves and admires TONY. He smiles boyishly.

     He moves on. The TV CREW stay with him.

                            JOURNALIST
                  Aren't you running the risk of
                  entrenching the need for charity by
                  increasingly institutionalising it?

                             TONY
                  Look, charity, like poor little
                  Olga...
                      (referring to the little
                       girl)
                  ...is always with us, to coin a
                  phrase...

     VALENTINA appears. She is beautifully dressed, coiffed, made-
     up, she looks stunning.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                      (to VALENTINA)
                  Ah, there you are, my lovely.

     She and TONY exchange broad smiles. They're in love. He pulls
     her to his side and puts his arm around her. The
     photographers snap away.

                            JOURNALIST
                  And what's your message to the
                  Prime Minister?

                            TONY
                      (laughs engagingly)
                  I wouldn't presume to have a
                  'message' for the Prime Minister...
                  Fortunately for the Foundation, I
                  think we pretty much see eye to eye
                  on most things.

     Now we hear a distant buzzing. EVERYBODY looks up.

     They see a speck in the sky, it's the PRIME MINISTER'S
     approaching helicopter...

     TONY and the posse of JOURNALISTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS rush off
     leaving VALENTINA standing alone.


65   EXT   HELICOPTER LANDING PAD DAY                             65

     The PRIME MINISTER and his WIFE get out of the helicopter,
     followed by their AIDES. TONY and the PRIME MINISTER shake
     hands for THE TV CAMERAS.

     VALENTINA watches from a distance..ignored.


66   INT   BALLROOM   NIGHT                                       66

     A huge chandelier illuminates a grand ornate ballroom where
     wealthy guests, in evening dress, are being seated at tables
     by liveried ushers. Large beautiful photographs of the
     underprivileged children of the world line the walls. A
     great banner reads "Suffer The Little Children Benefit Ball"

     The PRIME MINISTER and his WIFE are seated at the head table,
     facing the dais, bubbly and expectant. Security is heavy.


67   INT   ENTRANCE HALL   NIGHT                                  67

     TONY is conferring with his speech writers and assistants as
     VALENTINA descends the staircase looking utterly stunning in
     a beautiful gown. TONY bows, romantically kissing her hand.
     He turns her to admire their reflections in a gilt
     mirror...the perfect, beautiful, dream couple.

                         TONY
               You look gorgeous, my love.   I knew
               you wouldn't let me down.

     The little girl, OLGA, and a little boy are brought forward.
     They are dressed in ethnic clothes. TONY takes OLGA'S
     hand...offers the little boy's hand to VALENTINA. She takes
     it in her own. The four of them start to walk to the door
     leading to the ballroom.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (looking to everyone)
               This is a vitally important moment
               for the future of the Foundation.
               The children of the world are
               depending on us.

     TONY and VALENTINA look around. ANTON is nowhere to be seen
     but, his voice continues.

                            ANTON (V.O.)
                  All of this is false! It's nothing
                  to do with you! It's all him. It's
                  his imagination!

                            ANTON (V.O.)
                  It's all rotten! A naked lie!
                  You've got to understand!

     The LITTLE BOY is tugging VALENTINA'S arm.       She looks down.
     It's ANTON. A child-size ANTON.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  Look at this...

     He produces the newspaper with TONY'S photo and news story.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)

     TONY lunges for him but, ANTON dodges out of the way.

     TONY has grabbed little ANTON and starts hitting him.

                         TONY
               And now he doesn't stutter! You
               see!? It was all an act to get
               cheap sympathy!

               bitch!?.. after all I've lavished
               on you...OW!!

     Little ANTON has leapt on TONY's back and sunk his teeth into
     TONY'S ear. TONY throws him off and starts beating him.


68   INT   THE BALLROOM   CONTINUOUS                           68

     In the glittering ballroom a children's choir sings.

                         CHILDREN'S CHOIR
               "We are the world..we are the
               children..."

     Behind the choir the double doors of the ballroom crash
     open... exposing TONY violently beating up an `ethnic child.'

     Stunned silence as the horror of this happy scene sinks in.

     Then...

                         GUESTS
               My God! Somebody stop him!   He's a
               monster! Get him!

     As one they leap to their feet.

     TONY looks up and freezes. At the same time the walls of the
     ballroom begin to crack and disintegrate. TONY'S world starts
     to fall apart... literally.

     The floor around TONY falls away into an abyss leaving only a
     narrow escape route. He hurls ANTON aside and dashes away as
     the GUESTS pursue him. ANTON avoids being trampled but,
     loses his footing and falls over the edge.

                             VALENTINA
                  Anton!!!

     VALENTINA, fighting through the angry GUESTS, rushes to the
     edge of the abyss. ANTON is struggling to hold on to a
     broken floor joist that protrudes several feet down from the
     side of the cliff face.

                            ANTON
                  Valentina!..help me. Please.

     His grip slips. VALENTINA reaches for him, grasps his hand.

                            VALENTINA
                  Forgive me, Anton. I was wrong.

                            ANTON
                  I know... I'm not a child.

     And.. ANTON REVERTS TO HIS NORMAL SIZE...AND WEIGHT.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  I love you, Valentina.

     ANTON slips out of her grip, plummeting into the abyss.

                             VALENTINA
                  Noooo!

     Suddenly, VALENTINA is jerked backwards by her hair.

                            TONY
                  Who's behind this!? Eh!? You didn't
                  come up with this all on your own

     They turn to see PARNASSUS in the distance (where once the
     ballroom stood) stumbling towards them, drunk, desperate. As
     he moves forward a new landscape is created behind him.

     TONY rushes towards PARNASSUS.

                         TONY
               You old bastard! This is all your
               doing!

                   (drunkenly)
               All my doing?... I'm merely the
               facilititatater, dear boy.

                         GUESTS (O.S.)
               There he is! Stop him! Leave her
               alone. Get him!

     Throwing his arm around TONY, PARNASSUS spins him around to
     face the MOB rushing towards him.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               I create the opportunities. Is it
               my fault if your not up to it?

     Tony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken
     DOCTOR right into the path of the frenzied MOB. PARNASSUS is
     trampled underfoot in their rush to catch TONY.

                         VALENTINA
               Father! No!

     PARNASSUS'S body lies broken on the ground. Frantically,
     VALENTINA rushes to him, throwing herself on her father's
     battered body, sobbing hysterically.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               NO..NO NO... Please.. father..it's
               all my fault. What have I done?...

     With siren wailing, an AMBULANCE arrives, screeching to a
     halt. PARAMEDICS pull VALENTINA away. They check PARNASSUS
     for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney.
     VALENTINA can't control herself and tries to throw herself
     onto his body. The PARAMEDICS struggle with her.

                         PARAMEDIC

               NOOOOO...!!!

     VALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an
     animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC
     can finish speaking.

                         PARAMEDIC
               ...d-dead drunk.

     A bottle falls from the DOCTOR'S hand and explodes in a
     million fragments as it hits the ground.

     The shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror
     corridor down which a multi-reflected VALENTINA runs -
     sobbing like a madwoman - lashing out at her reflections,
     some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with TONY,
     irritated with ANTON, angry with PARNASSUS.

                         VALENTINA
                   (to her reflections)
               You little fool! You're to blame!..
               for everything... I hate you!

     The multi-reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two
     mirrors identical to the one used in the Imaginarium. The one
     to the left is marked 'His' with a bowler hat, the other to
     the right 'Hers' with a bonnet. She hesitates.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                   (laughing madly)
               So this is to be my choice!!

     MR NICK appears out of the "His" mirror - a burst of flame
     behind him.

     He makes a sweeping gesture inviting VALENTINA to enter the
     mirror marked 'Hers'.

     VALENTINA, heads for the mirror marked 'His'. MR NICK blocks
     her path.

                         MR NICK
               Now, there's absolutely no need for
               that. That's just plain
               contrariness.

     VALENTINA tries to get around him.

     VALENTINA feints another direction. MR NICK blocks her.

               Wrong. I'm 16...I'm a woman now..

     She spins around him...he blocks....a kind of dance between
     them begins - confusingly reflected in the mirrors. A tango
     can be heard.

               ...a selfish bitch, everyone I love
               dies...I'm...

                         MR NICK
               ...only fit for hell? If only.

     He looks at Valentina with lascivious intent. He's tempted,
     briefly, but resists it.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               No... your pop would never speak to
               me again. And that'd be a shame.
               Let's dance.

     Reflected in the swirling mirror fragments, they tango until
     he spins her towards the right hand mirror. She sails through
     - and, with a mad smile, throws him a kiss.

     The mirror closes with a burst of flame. The briefest flash
     of DR. PARNASSUS face is reflected in the mirror fragments.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
               Valentina!!!!!!

     MR NICK turns, realizing he has been looking into a mirror
     fragment reflecting the two mirrors. The writing on the
     Valentina's mirror reads "His".

                         MR NICK
               Damn!... I've won.

                                                                112.




69   EXT   STRANGE   MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE                           69

     DR. PARNASSUS is sitting alone on a prominent bluff (the same
     one he tried throwing himself off many years ago) He's
     distraught. Tears run down this cheeks. A distant bell tolls
     midnight.

     MR NICK appears behind PARNASSUS...sits down beside him.

                         MR NICK
               Funny how things work out, isn't
               it?

     He lights a cigarette.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               It's not what I had in mind
               y'know... this.. Valentina, being
               the fifth... It doesn't seem
               right... She's supposed to be the
               prize, the star prize... not part
               of the bloody score... And you
               lumbered with eternal life all over
               again... What a bummer, eh?

     No response from PARNASSUS. A Tarot cards drops from his
     hand. It is The Hanged Man.

     MR. NICK points to the plain far below. Across the harsh
     ground, TONY is running for his life...pursued by the MOB.

                          MR NICK (CONT'D)
               I hope they get that bastard. Tear
               him limb from limb... But they
               won't... He leads a charmed life,
               that one... I've been trying to
               nail him for years... I thought I
               had him this time. But, there's
               always some prat comes to his
               rescue... Talk about the luck of
               the Devil.
                   (he laughs)
               Those weird markings you found on
               him... on his forehead... Those
               satanic-symbol, so-called,
               things... What's all that about?...
               Maybe they protect him in some
               way... I've never been into that
               black-magic stuff myself... Can't
               seem to get the hang of it... I
               know, pathetic isn't it?...

     PARNASSUS ignores him, sunk even deeper into despondency.

                            MR NICK (CONT'D)
                  God, I hate to see you like this.
                  Look, I tell you what... If you can
                  get the lowdown on those satanic
                  markings, or.. wait.. better
                  still, if you can wipe that self-
                  righteous little creep off the face
                  of the universe... I'll give you
                  Valentina back.

     A beat. Slowly, PARNASSUS looks up.

                            MR NICK (CONT'D)
                  How about it?


70   EXT   SOMEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN                              70

     TONY, sweating, panting for breath, is running up the
     mountain.

     Below, the MOB is still in hot pursuit.

     TONY reaches the summit. In front of him, is his salvation -
     an empty gibbet. A noose hangs from the crossbeam.

                            TONY
                  Thank God for that!

     TONY relaxes a little.

     We can hear the mob now, struggling up the mountain.

     TONY digs into one of his pockets and pulls out the brass
     tube that he has always kept close.

     TONY opens his mouth and is about to slip the tube down his
     throat when he spots the Hanged Man Tarot card lying at his
     feet. A hand from behind him snatches the tube away.

     TONY, startled, turns to find himself looking up at DR.
     PARNASSUS.

     PARNASSUS is standing on a chair with the noose around his
     neck. He smiles and opens his hand. The metal tube has
     vanished.

     TONY panics. The MOB is getting closer.




                                                        (CONTINUED)

     With his other hand DR. PARNASSUS produces the tube from
     TONY'S ear.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                      (desperate)
                  Give me that!

     DR. PARNASSUS gestures at the CROWD.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Give us a moment, please.

     The CROWD goes into very slow motion...but twice as angry.

     DR. PARNASSUS teases TONY with magic.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  Here's your tube... Here's mine.
                      (producing a second tube)
                  But mine's just a cheap
                  counterfeit... Look, it breaks...
                      (he breaks it)
                  But here's another...

                            TONY
                  Stop!

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  You're not amused?

                            TONY
                      (desperate)
                  You've been talking to the devil,
                  haven't you? Let me guess what he
                  said... If you manage to kill me,
                  he'll release Valentina. Yes? Am I
                  right?... I am aren't I? It's all
                  lies. He can't release her. And why
                  not? Because he doesn't have her.
                  He can't have her because she's the
                  prize.
                      (gaining confidence)
                  He doesn't have five wins. But if
                  you kill me he will, won't he?
                  You'll have lost Valentina forever!

     DR. PARNASSUS does a double hand shuffle.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Choose.

               This is ridiculous!

                          DR.    PARNASSUS
               Choose!

     TONY chooses.

                          TONY
               You've got to believe me! For all
               our sakes!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Are you sure you made the right
               choice?

                          TONY
               Look...

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Let's find out.

     He slides the tube down his throat and kicks the chair away.

     He drops... dangles from the rope...the noose tight around
     his neck.

     At the same moment, the MOB resumes normal speed and roars up
     the mountain.

     Is PARNASSUS dead?

     Working very fast, TONY hoists him over his shoulder and
     wrestles the noose loose. He drops PARNASSUS on the ground.
     He's stunned but still alive.

     The MOB is closing in.

     TONY slaps DR. PARNASSUS hard between the shoulder blades.

     The tube pops out of the DOCTOR'S gullet. TONY catches it.

                          TONY
               Gotcha!

     TONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet,
     grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the
     chair, tightening the noose around his neck.




                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Although battered, TONY winks smugly at DR. PARNASSUS, but
     his mood changes when he sees DR. PARNASSUS spit out several
     more fake tubes, then, gagging, force the real one up and out
     of his gullet.

     With a look of realization and horror, TONY drops to his
     death as the MOB kicks the chair away from under him.

     The MOB cheers. Yes, he's dead.

     DR. PARNASSUS tosses the metal tube to MR NICK who steps
     coolly out of the MOB, cigarette in his mouth.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (hoarsely)
               There are three cardinal rules.
               One, there's no black-magic, only
               cheap tricks. And... er... I forget
               the others. Now, where's my
               daughter?

                         MR NICK
               How should I know? You're her
               father.
                   (with needle)
               Her loving father.

     DR PARNASSUS looks askance at MR NICK.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               She's free... isn't she?

     MR NICK smiles and blows smoke in PARNASSUS'S face. The smoke
     fills the screen and becomes...

     ... a dust storm. The wind is howling. The swirling dust
     thins to reveal DR.PARNASSUS, alone, exhausted, trudging
     across a vast desert.

     He's tormented by his thoughts.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               What else could I do, Valentina?
               What else could I have done... What

               Damn!... It was the right choice...

                  Where's my darling? How long must I
                  suffer?

     There is no proper road, only endless sand, but nevertheless
     DR. PARNASSUS reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct
     paths.

     One leads to a tidy little suburban home, the other up an
     dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut
     into the rock (the same one that MARTIN THE DRUNK chose not
     to climb days earlier.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  No, no, no... No more choices,
                  please... No more choices...!!!

     Enraged, he tries to push the sign over, but is too feeble.
     Exhausted, he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone.

                               VOICE (V.O.)
                         (angry)
                  Hey!

     DR. PARNASSUS, alarmed, rolls quickly off the stone.

     Now on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of
     PERCY'S head and face. What he'd thought was a stone was, in
     fact, his old companion buried in the sand.

                               DR. PARNASSUS
                  Percy!

     DR. PARNASSUS, overjoyed, begins to dig PERCY out.

     suburban bungalow, past a perfect lawn and double garage, to
     the front door.

     PERCY rings the bell.

     DR. PARNASSUS tries to make a run for it but PERCY holds him
     fast.

     The door is opened by VALENTINA. She's older and is carrying

                      (recovering)
                  Where have you been?... All these
                  years... I thought you were dead.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  So did I. But you... I...

                             VALENTINA
                  Come in.

     VALENTINA steps back and ushers her father in.

                            PERCY
                      (aside)
                  So far, so good.

     PERCY is about to follow, but VALENTINA, focussing on her
     father, closes the door in his face.

     VALENTINA shows DR. PARNASSUS into the sitting-room. He sits
     on the sofa.

                            KID'S VOICE (V.O.)
                  Mummy? Can I have some ice-cream?

     A SMALL BOY enters from the kitchen.

                             KID
                  Mummy?

                            VALENTINA
                  Billy, this is your grandad. Say
                  hello to your grandad.
                      (to Parnassus)
                  I think he looks a little like you.

     BILLY takes one look at DR. PARNASSUS and runs back into the
     kitchen.

     VALENTINA laughs.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  He's only five. And he's very shy.
                  Would you like some tea?


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                  120.

     DR. PARNASSUS nods.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  Okay, you look after Imogen.

     She gives him the baby.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  She's eight months, and, so far,
                  fortunately, doesn't look in the
                  least like you.

     DR. PARNASSUS is moved.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  This is all I ever wanted... I know
                  it's not what you wanted for me,
                  but...well... there you go... I'm
                  happy.

     ANTON enters.

                            ANTON
                  Hello Doctor.

     He puts his arm around VALENTINA.

                            VALENTINA
                  We're both happy.

     DR. PARNASSUS doesn't know what to say. He sits there, a
     ragged old man with a baby on his knee, tears streaming down
     his face.


74   EXT   RAILWAY STATION    CENTRAL LONDON                       74

     Little cut-out cardboard figures are 'performing' in a toy
     theatre.

                            VOICE OF TOY CHARACTER (V.O.)
                  It's your choice. You can stay here
                  and look after mum and dad, or come
                  with me and help fight the giant.

                            SECOND TOY CHARACTER (V.O.)
                  I'll have to think about it.

     THE CAMERA pulls back to show PERCY manipulating the puppets
     and giving them voices. He and DR. PARNASSUS are running a
     stall selling toy theatres. Business is good.

     The audience is made up of mainly KIDS, with some ADULTS.
     COMMUTERS come and go.

     A COUPLE OF PARENTS purchase a theatre for their son. DR.
     PARNASSUS takes the money and expertly wraps the theatre.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Beautifully made. It'll last for
                  years if properly looked after.

                            NINE YEAR OLD SON
                  Does it come with a happy ending?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  I'm afraid we can't guarantee that.

     THE CAMERA angles across the table...

     In a shadowy corner stands MR NICK, smoking a cigarette.
