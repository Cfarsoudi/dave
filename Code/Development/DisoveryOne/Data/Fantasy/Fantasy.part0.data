                        Experiment 208, day 20...
          
          
          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - DAY

          We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the
          inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the
          scientist, in a white coat.
          
           We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated
          MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with
          the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level
          move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but
          then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.
          
          We pull back further to see the back and legs of the
          DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The
          regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms.
          
                                  DICTATOR
                    Useless.
          
                                  SCIENTIST
                       Please.   Give it a chance.
          
          We're on the machine, which is clicking and jerking as it
          malfunctions.
          
                                  DICTATOR (V.O.)
          One more.      That's all.
          We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the
          soldiers accompany him out.
          
          We see the scientist's dejected face as he comes towards the
          camera to turn it off.


                                                                     CUT TO:

          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - NIGHT
          
          The grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving
          away from the camera (having just turned it on).
          
          The lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for
          the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously
          filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor
          is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the
          worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box.
          
                              SCIENTIST
                        (tired, but dictating to
                         keep the documentary
                         record complete)
                    My last possible solution....
                        (muttering to himself)
                    It must work...
          
          He gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though
          for good luck. He picks the TALISMAN up off the table. He
          moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the
          machine.
          
          His back to us, he faces the machine. We see him putting
          something over his face (but only from behind).
          
          There is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS,
          and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity
          crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc.
          
          The scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run.
          Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.
          
          The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets
          up and comes towards camera.
          
          We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:
          CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks
          sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.
          
          Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new
          sort of energy. Something new has happened.
          
          The scientist switches off the camera and:
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - A DAY LATER
          
          The machine zips through the complex 3-D chess game at
          lightning speed, checkmating the scientist in seconds as the
          Dictator watches.

          The scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine.
          
                                 DICTATOR
                      Perfect.

                      You see, it evolves.
          
          The scientist proudly gives the machine to the dictator. A
          flash goes off: someone is taking a picture O.S.
          
          The dictator exits; we hear the click of boots and see as
          much as possible of the soldiers flanking him.
          
          OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SCIENTIST,
          
          CLOSE on the machine: the dictator is gripping it with a
          nasty firmness. The machine seems to try to squirm away.
          The director's BLACK-GLOVED HAND grasps it harder.
          
           he machine, responding to the brutality, lashes an arm out
          and grabs the nearest soldier (seen from the back, we see
          only the uniform and helmeted head) by the back of his arm,
          BREAKING his ARM. The soldier falls (if possible).
          
           he dictator CONTINUES ON WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE.

          little box sitting on the cluttered makeshift worktable.

          Talisman off.
          
          The little burlap figure pulls himself to his feet, shaking

          that, trying to make sense of his surroundings.
          
          He walks over to the edge of the tabletop. He peers over, and
          sees...
          
          ...the SCIENTIST LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR.
          
           lumped on the floor, we clearly see: the scientist's
          skeletal hand is clutching a tiny box.
          
          He hears a clattering sound and turns to see
          A
              loose window shutter. He goes over to the window.

           usting machine carcasses, bombed-out ruins, and emptiness
          stretch as far as he can see.
          
          Terrible, life-ending destruction.
          
           here is no other living being anywhere.
          
          9 stares in disbelief and horror and fear. He can't make any
          sense of it... or the room... or the endless miles of
          lifeless wasteland stretching out in front of him.
          
           e seems to be completely alone.

          moves to go outside.

          He stops and is strangely drawn to the TALISMAN. He turns
          and takes it, stowing it inside his zippered chest before he
          heads out.

          SEQ. 029 - EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
          
          9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted
          RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.
          
          Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered
          clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human
          civilization surround him.
          
          He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front
          seat of a car.
          
          Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on
          them.
          
           achines lie deserted on the sides of roads.
          
          Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged
          old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and
          Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears
          to be a dictator/leader.
          
          9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.
          Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.
          
          9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war
          Machine.
          
           LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.
          
          Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a
          piece of metal lying in front of him.
          
          The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure
          emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him
          with all his might.
          
          9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2
          is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris
          behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.
          
                              2

          But 2 is looking at 9 with surprise.   He struggles to get up,
                               2
          speaking with urgency to 9.
          
          
                        (firmly, kindly, almost
                         eagerly; like trying to
                         soothe a wild animal)
                    Wait... I am a friend.

                    Friend... I am a friend.
          
          9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He
          hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his
          hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,
          but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to
          help 2 up.
          
          We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more
          primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of
          OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is
          tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.
          His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of
          eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.
          
          9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see
          that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a
          contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.
          
          2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on
          his back.

                    Yes... yes... I always thought
                    there'd be one more.
          
          He nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand.
          While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding
          with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more
          sophisticated than 2's.
          
                              2 (CONT'D)

          2 turns slightly, and 9 sees his number and tries to say it.
          But no sound comes out of his mouth.
          
            looks at him, nodding, again, the kind mentor. He's
          interested, observing without judging; curious, kindly and
          ready to help.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      You can't speak.
          
          With a friendly, disarming smile, he taps 9's zipper. 9
          unzips himself and 2 peers in. 2 looks up, happy that he can
          help.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      Yes, yes...
          
          2 looks around nervously and hurries over to his roller-skate
          cart covered with detritus - odds and ends, a broken china
          doll.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      ...come with me.

          2 finds the china doll.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      Here!
          
          As 2 rummages through the chest of the china doll 9 picks up
          a bullet casing from 2's cart and starts tapping it. 2 turns
          with the doll's voice box in his hand.

                      No! Stop!
          
          2 eases the bullet away from 9, then smiles gently at 9,
          EXPLAINING:

                      Some things in this world are
                      better left where they lie.
          
           e puts the bullet to one side and kneels, prying into 9's
          chest. 2 begins to connect the doll's voice box.

                    But if you know where to look,
                    these ruins are full of riches.
          
          2 concentrates, a look of pleasure on his face as he twists a
          few more wires. Static and unclear sound come out at first,
          but as 2 tunes the voice further...
          
                              9
                        (as his voice is "tuned
                         in".. starting with pure
                         static, then slowly
                         moving into a voice)
                    Chhhhhhh.....chhhhehhhh...
          
                              2

                    ...almost there...
          
          9 gets a little panicky look on his face at the strange
          sounds coming out of him. 2 puts a calm hand on his
          shoulder. 9 calms down and tries again.
          
                               9
                    Friend?   Friend?

            and 2 stare at each other. 9 looks at 2 in wonderment,
          then reaches out and touches 2's chest where he hit it.
          
          2 beams at 9, happy 9 can speak, happy he was able to help,
          and happy that 9, with his first words, is concerned about
          others.
          
            glow beams from within 9's chest.   2 stares.   9 removes the
          TALISMAN from his chest.

          2 attempts to reach for his spear but the Beast holds him
          down with its razor-sharp feet.
          
          The Beast is attracted to the Talisman. It picks it up with
          one of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically.
          
            cringes.    His movement makes his hiding place teeter,
          creaking.
          
           he Cat Beast WHIRLS at the sound. Picking up 2's struggling
          body, the Cat Beast stalks towards the noise, right up to 9's
          hiding place, sniffing through its hollow nostrils. 9
          cringes in terror. The Cat Beast probes with one of his
          claws INTO the tin can. 9 recoils. The claws do not find
          him and retreat. 9 is relieved.
          
          A beat, then:
          
          9 feels himself violently LIFTED UP and SMASHED.
          
          We see the Cat Beast has picked up the entire tin can and is
          smashing it to get at what's inside it.   Failing, it hurls
          the tin can aside.
          
          9 is almost knocked out. Trying to stay conscious, he
          struggles towards the entrance of the can.
          
           is POV: through his haze and through the broken edges of the
          opening to the can, he sees the Cat Beast GRAB the Talisman
          and the struggling 2 in his sharp-toothed mouth, and
          disappearing into the smoky mist.
          
          9 can just make out, in the distance, the silhouettes of
          
          THREE TALL SHAPES.

          Another RAGDOLL pushes into the workroom. This is a bigger
          ragdoll, the most primitive one we have seen. He has
          primitive wooden hinges for feet. He is very frayed and
          patched together. The number 1 is painted on his back.
          
              and 9 whirl around.       5 CRINGES.

                      I... I was coming to tell you...
          
          1 carries himself with authority. He wears a red cloak, and
          a strange mother of pearl and wire hat bound together as an
          almost papal-like headpiece, and carries a staff made from an
          old gear, with a bell attached.
          
            pulls at 9 with his staff, displaying the number on his
          back.

            turns and glares at 5 like a general glaring at a new
          private, expecting an explanation for a misdeed. 5 cringes
          back, obviously intimidated by 1.

          1 HOOKS 5 by the neck with his staff, cutting off his speech.

                    I saw him from the watchtower and I
                    thought...
          
          
                     ou'll lead The Beast straight back
                    to us! How many times have I told
                    you?
          
          
                    The Beast--that's what took 2!   If
                    we hurry we could save him--
          
                               1
                        (CURTLY)
                    If the Beast took him, that's the
                    end of it.
          
                              9
                    But he was still alive--
          
          5 turns with sudden hope to 9.   2 might still be alive?
          
                              1
                    No, we have RULES.
          
          1 smashes his staff against the ground.
          
          Immediately, a knife comes through the curtain revealing
          another RAGDOLL: a large ragdoll, with the number "8" on his
          arm.
          
                                (CONT'D)
                        (TO 8)
                    Our new guest seems confused.
                        (condescendingly, to 9)
                    Perhaps I can help you achieve some
                    clarity.
          
          8 is very large, and designed for great strength. He is
          almost as evolved in his design as 9, but his design favors
          primarily brute force.
          
          He has armored himself with curved pieces of tin and metal.
          He carries the blade of a large kitchen knife, with a nail he
          has attached for a handle. On his back he has slung another
          knife--half of a scissors; the scissors handle loops up above
          his head.

          talking also.

          into the bucket.

          frantically trying to escape the explosions BURSTING around
          them. 7 appears with 3 and 4. We get the sense that 7 is
          the reckless one, the only one determined to SCOUT AROUND and
          see what's out there.

                    I found others...
          
          They are welcomed in by the other dolls. They turn to 1, who
          is clearly the leader, to see what to do next. 1 decides: he
          points forward, and they all run a few feet while underneath
          the helmet.
          
          A plane crashes in the background, causing 5 to fall behind
          (he has both eyes).
          
           hrough a dirty MIST we see War Machines enter with their
          weapons.
          
          A RESISTANCE FIGHTER throws a Molotov cocktail at one of the
          Machines. It turns and SHOOTS a round of gunfire.
          
          A MUSTARD GAS BOMB is launched from the top of the Machine.
          It heads straight at 5 but he runs and gets KNOCKED to the
          ground, barely missing it.
          T
           he bomb lets out a yellow CLOUD that envelops the area and
          KILLS PLANTS ON CONTACT.
          
          7 turns and sees 5 lying face-down on the ground.   1 urges
          her to stay with the others.

          But, again, brave and slightly reckless, she runs through the
          yellow cloud to help him. She brings him back to the group.
          His left eye is damaged. The others cower. 2, the gentle
          mentor of the group, puts a comforting hand on 5's damaged
          eye. 7, always the scout, brave and fearless, points off to
          the right, and addresses 1.   She knows what's out there;
          she's seen it.

          1 looks around calculatingly, like Patton: the general taking
          charge. He thinks, judiciously, then:
          
                                 1
                        (TO 7)
                    Go ahead.
          
            nods and darts off.      1 turns to the others, who wait for
          their instructions.

          They hurry off, increasingly enveloped by the YELLOW CLOUD.
          
          The yellow CLOUD TRANSITIONS into STEAM...

                      I'm going. I'm going to look for
                      him.
          
          He turns to 5.

            is terribly torn. He wants to, but he's never done
          anything like this before. He's always done as he's told.
          He hesitates:
          
                                5

                    I can't.
          
          9 looks directly into his eyes. He knows how 5 loved and
          admired his mentor and everything he did. He understands
          that 5 would like to be like 2, to do what 2 would have done.

                    But wouldn't he have come for you?
          
          9 waits, hopefully. But 5 looks away. He wants to do it,
          but he doesn't have the nerve. 9 nods, compassionately. He
          turns away. 5 hesitates, looking down, then:
          
                              5
                        (more determined)
                    Wait!
          
          5 grabs the map off the wall and rolls it up.   He walks
          towards 9.

            and 9 look around constantly, on the alert for the Cat
          Beast. Piles of rusted, broken metal machines, broken

          crumbling, disintegrating buildings surround them.

          5 hurries up the hill. 9 follows him. 5 turns to FIND 2's
          hat lying in the dirt. He bends down to pick it up, brushing
          the dust off the top. 5 looks sadly at 2's broken hat.

                       We can still find him.

          filling with hope, gets up too. 5 puts 2's hat on his
          quiver. 9 offers 2's staff to 5 but 5 gestures to 9 for him
          to hold it.
          
          They continue on, through the debris and devastation.     A
          storm is starting to come up. The wind howls loudly.

                       to ask.
          
          They exchange a look. This is the first time 5 has said
          something to actually challenge 1's rules. 9 notices this
          and nods.

          tries to keep leading them forward.
          
          They come to a field full of trip mines and dangerous tank
          trap pits.   A parachute blows in the wind on a tree branch.
          
          5 turns the map one way and the other with growing panic.

          As he turns the map to look at it, the wind picks up and
          blows the map out of 5's hands. It blows away into the
          distance and gets stuck on a pole.
          
          5 reaches after it desperately but can't retrieve it.      He
          looks in despair at 9.

                    There.
          
          They head over to the trench.      They now see a huge FOOTPRINT
          OF THE BEAST.
          
          They inspect the footprints. 9 moves bravely towards the
          trench entrance. 5 resists, afraid.
          
          
                    No... it's too dark.

          a battery and electrical wire from his chest, winds the wire
          around the battery and places it inside the hat.

          smiling at 9.

          has happened to 2.

                      Yes. He will.
          
          9 is conveying with his simple words that he believes 2 IS
          still alive and he WILL be impressed when he sees the
          lightstaff.
          
          9 shines the light to gesture "this way."
          
          5 smiles tremulously at 9, almost more grateful for his
          sympathy and support than necessarily believing him. He
          follows 9 to the mouth of the trench.
          
          The camera pans over to reveal catlike scratchmarks on a side

          travel through earlier.

          both hands on the lightstaff and enters the trench. 5 takes

          The FACTORY: A enormous, destroyed old stone building, its
          caved-in ceiling revealing huge boilers, scarred old metal
          walkways and catwalks dangling, dust-covered rotting turbines
          exposed to the elements.

          Enormous metal arms lie motionless. Huge steel hooks tower
          over the belt, with sharp-edged pieces of Machinery dangling
          from them.
          
          They look around in horror.
          
           arge pieces of Machinery, pipes, and ducts dangle from the
          ceilings. Layers of dust cover everything like eerie
          blankets. Bundles of wires lie ripped from their moorings.
          
           ools and shards of glass and metal are strewn around the
          floor, twisted into strange melted shapes.

          now see 2, imprisoned in an old   birdcage. In the b.g., the
          CAT BEAST lurks, next to a pile   of what seems like debris and
          broken machinery. The talisman    is on the floor next to the
          Cat Beast. The Cat Beast seems    to be looking for something
          in the debris. The Cat Beast's    back is to us.

          He motions towards the Beast.
          
          5 and 9 try to pry the bars open. 2 tries to help. They
          just manage to pry the bars open and get 2 out when--
          
          Suddenly a light SHINES above them. They look up and see --
          
          The Cat Beast beaming his light from his eye. It GROWLS.
          
          The three dolls run away frantically.    The Cat Beast chases
          after them.
          
          9 gets cornered but swipes the Beast and manages to escape.
          9 jumps a heap of debris but stumbles. 5 and 2 pull him up
          to higher ground.
          
              shoots his crossbow at the Cat Beast, shattering his eye.
          
          2 manages to hide in a tube.
          
          9 and 5 run away but get stuck at the end of a table.

          They climb onto another piece of debris, only to encounter
          the Cat Beast, now in front of them.
          
           he Cat Beast slashes a claw out and knocks them over.    The
          Cat Beast moves closer and closer. They are doomed.
          
           uddenly there is a strange rhythmic moaning sound.   The Cat
          Beast turns, distracted.
          
          We pan over and see a mysterious creature that seems to be
          half ragdoll, half bird, with a bird-skull head swinging a
          weapon over its head.   THIS IS 7. 7 releases the weapon--a
          strap of leather with weighted shot at either end. The
          weapon flies through the air with a low whooshing sound and
          strikes the Cat Beast, entangling it.
          
          7, 5, and 9 now charge the Cat Beast. 5 shoots his crossbow,
          entangling the Beast's paw and hobbling it. 9 and 2 both
          LURE THE CAT BEAST IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, deliberately
          goading and further causing it to become entangled in the
          machinery.   7 now leaps up over the Beast and brings the
          full weight of her spear down on the Cat Beast's neck. The
          head of the Beast comes off and lands at their feet.
          7
              now pulls off her bird-skull helmet.
          
                                5
                       !
          
          
                      You weren't lost--
          
                                5
                      You've come back!
          
                                7
                      I never left. YOU finally decided
                      to join the fight.
          
           he hands 5's map back to him.
          
          9 comes over with her shield (lost during the fight).    7
          looks 9 over.

          They move towards her but she turns and looks at 9.     2 and 5
          nod proudly towards 9. 7 nods.
          
           hey all look at the fallen Cat Beast.
          
          2 is poking at it:

          They all turn to leave. 5 and 7 support 2 on either side of
          him, helping 2 along.   9 hangs back to look at the machine
          again, and suddenly sees the TALISMAN, lying on the floor.
          
          5, 7, and 2 have continued on without him and do not see him
          as he picks it up.
          
            looks at the strange object with ENORMOUS CURIOSITY. He
          turns it and see the RUNES on the side of it. He turns and
          inspects it closely.   He turns and discovers, on the
          machine, a PORT with the SAME RUNES.
          
          
                        (blurting out)
                    Look!
          
          The others now turn to see him. They see him holding the
          talisman close to the machine's port... about to
          experimentally put the talisman INTO the port.
          
                                  2
                    No!   Stop!       NO!
          
          2 tries to break free and stagger towards him but it is too
          late. 9 puts the talisman into the port.
          
           othing happens for a moment.
          
          Then suddenly, horribly, the ground begins to SHAKE.

          A mechanical ARM emerges and PINS 7, 9, and 5.
          
          As dust and debris rain down, we see one hideous RED EYE
          begin to come up.
          
           s 2 tries to scramble to safety, the other three ragdolls,
          pinned by the mechanical arm, stare in horror. We see that
          the "pile of Machinery" has risen to reassemble into an
          monstrous, towering FABRICATION MACHINE attached to the
          ceiling of the building.
          
          It is enormous, a spherical shape with a dozen folded
          appendages, each with different fabrication tools at the end
          of its long spindly robotic arms.
          
          2 tries to crawl away but the Machine grabs him with his
          robotic arm.
          T
           he Machine points the talisman towards 2 and it OPENS up to
          a sparking green glow. 2 struggles in the Machine's claw but
          the strange green energy SHOOTS directly into 2's mouth and
          eyes, painfully  his soul.
          
           NGLE on 2 as his soul is being taken.
          
          2 slumps over, his LIFELESS CARCASS smoking in the grip of
          the Machine.
          
           NGLE on the green glow as it PASSES into the machine. The
          sound has drawn its attention. The Machine turns towards
          them and grabs at them with its enormous claw. 9, 5, and 7
          turn and flee.
          
          The Fabrication Machine's arms chase after them. 5 shoots
          his grappling hook onto a switch. 9 and 7 grab onto him.
          
          Frantically working together, the three of them manage to
          escape the Machine's horrifying arms. [  Important to make
          sure the Machine is understood to be tethered to the
          Factory.]
          
          They see in the distance a pipe that leads out.
          
          In the Machine's RED POV, they run into it just as the
          Machine's arm is behind them but can't fit into the hole.

          6 emerges from his shadowy corner and comes over to 9. He
          has a drawing of the Talisman and seems to want to show it 9,

          1 bangs his staff against the floor. 8 stands at attention.

          8 PUNCHES 9 out of the way, knocking him to the edge of the

          outside. 1 starts to back away.

          The WINGED BEAST tail crashes through the stained glass
          window and breaks into the floor right next to 9.
          
                                                                      42.

          5, 6, 8 and 9 huddle together. Suddenly the Winged Beast
          comes crashing in the window behind them, knocking over the
          thurible and splashing hot coals all over the floor.

          5, 6, 8 and 9 see the Winged Beast emerge from the smoke
          pouring out of the upset thurible.
          
          The Winged Beast SHRIEKS at them. It catches its foot on the
          runner leading up to 1's empty throne. The hymnboard/
          calendar topples away to reveal 1 hiding behind it. 1
          instinctively clutches his staff causing the bell at the top
          of the staff to RING and attracting the Winged Beast's
          attention.
          1
            flees. 8 charges the Beast but it SCYTHES its wing towards
          him and knocks 8 across the floor. 8 slides across the floor
          to 1, who stands next to 6's picture of the Cat Beast.
          
          1 pushed the picture of the Cat Beast away to reveal a HIDDEN
          PASSAGEWAY. 1 runs away as 8 looks at the others for a brief
          moment before also running away.
          
          The Winged Beast turns its attention to 9, 5, and 6. The
          ragdolls run for the bucket and bell-ropes, but 9 trips. The
          Winged Beast advances towards him.   5 reaches out to 9.  9
          gestures to him to continue without him.
          
          As 9 recovers himself and makes a break for the bucket, 5
          starts to lower the bucket down. Just as the Winged Beast is
          about to catch up with him, 9 LEAPS down the shaft and lands
          in the bucket with 5 and 6.
          
          Angrily, the Beast lashes its harpoon tail down at them,
          piercing the bottom of the bucket. The bucket rocks and 6 is
          sent FLYING OUT but 5 CATCHES him in the nick of time.

          The Winged Beast starts reeling its harpoon tail in. Jerking
          back and forth, the bucket ascends, drawing the ragdolls
          closer and closer to the Beast.
          
          9 spots a SMALL LEDGE next to a stained glass window.
          
          He opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they should
          jump.
          
          The others hesitate, but then 9, 6, and 5 jump out of the
          bucket onto a swinging rope, and onto the ledge. The Winged
          Beast plummets down the shaft after them.

          The ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stained
          glass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the Cathedral's roof.
          
          9 sees 1 and 8 running across the roof and points to 5 and 6
          to look down there. Down on the roof, 1 and 8 see 5, 6, and
          9. 1 pushes past 8 and runs farther out, towards the front
          of the Cathedral. 8 follows.
          S
           uddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behind
          them. It struggles to get through the window but can't quite
          fit.
          
          6 is very vulnerable out there.
          
          9 turns to 5.
          
                                9
                      Take him inside.
          
              now climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully.
          
          The Winged Beast FLIES UP into the air, circling lazily.    1
          and 8, running on the top of the roof, are very exposed.
          Hawklike, the Winged Beast sails towards them.
          
          8 steps up to defend 1. He flips his salt-shaker helmet down
          over his face as armor, pulls out his scissor knife and
          stands his ground... waiting... waiting for the Winged Beast
          to soar in closer...
          
          And then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissor
          knife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air and
          catches in the Beast's propeller.
          
          Knocked off balance, the Beast swoops down. 1 ducks out of
          the way but it knocks 8 off his feet. 8 slides down the
          sloped edge of the roof, towards GAPING HOLE.

          Just as 8 is about to fall into the hole, he catches on to
          the edge. His other blade plummets through the hole as he
          hangs, desperately... his grip SLIPPING...
          
          9 catches up to where 1 is.

          The Winged Beast circles around and sets its harpoon tail to
          shoot. 1 squints into the sun as the Winged Beast, backlit,
          swoops down towards them. He sees a glare come from the tin
          roof. 9 gets an idea.    He gestures to 1 to help him. 1
          scowls, but has no alternative but to help him.

          Blinded by the glare, it MISSES and almost hits 8.
          
          The harpoon imbeds itself into a rafter inside the Cathedral.

          The Winged Beast plummets after them onto the wing. It picks
          itself up, spots the cowering ragdolls, and opens up his
          bladed beak screaming.
          
          The Winged Beast starts to charge them when suddenly--
          
          7 DROPS DOWN from a high parapet and leaps onto the Winged
          Beast's neck.

          She'd dropped her spear; she goes to pick it up and
          
           PFFFFFFT> immediately, her leg is IMPALED by the Winged
          Beast, which has fired its harpoon. She is impaled next to

          fights viciously.
          
              jumps and grabs on to 7 as she's being pulled away.

            grabs her forked spear and hands it to her. She grabs her
          forked spear and stabs it into the plane.   The harpoon's
          cable is pulled taut 9
                               between her leg and the Winged Beast.
          
          
                          (yelling to the others)
                      The cable! Cut it!
          
          8 runs to recover the blade that slipped from his grasp as he
          slid down the roof, then runs over and SLICES with all his
          brute force through the cable. The cable flies up in the air
          and WRAPS itself around the propeller on the end of the wing.
          
          The Winged Beast jerks back, towards the propeller, causing
          the whole wing of the plane to tilt, and the ragdolls to
          slide. 5 and 6 tumble into the plane's engine room.

          7 clutches her staff. 9 slides by her and grabs on to the
          harpoon, still lodged in her leg.
          
          9's staff slides by, and 9 catches it just before it falls
          off the wing. As 8 climbs up onto the same buttress fragment
          that 7's spear is lodged in, 1 slides down the wing, past 9.

                     Grab on!
          
          1 grabs 9's staff. Dangling, he sees that the Winged Beast
          is close behind, snapping at him with its beak.
          
          9 sees 5 and 6 in the engine room.

                     propeller!
          
          6 nods. 5 points to the wires. 5 and 6 gather wires and set
          to work. They ZAP the propeller to life and it GROANS... then
          whines into motion as it starts taking up the power it had
          generated. It goes faster... faster...
          
          Even as the Beast is slowly drawn towards the propeller, it
          struggles forward and grabs 1's cape in its beak.
          
          As the Winged Beast pulls 1 closer, 9 strains to hang on to
          1, and 7 strains with the added weight on the harpoon
          sticking out of her wounded leg.
          
                               1

                                  9
                     Let it go!
          
          1 glares furiously, hesitates, then undoes the clasp. The
          Winged Beast falls backwards down the wing, DIRECTLY INTO THE
          DEADLY BLADES.
          
          It is instantly shredded.
          
          Claws, feathers, and strange mechanical debris shower down.
          
           , 9, and 7 look in relief as the Beast is finally destroyed.
          
           fter the clasp is released, 1 has meanwhile recoiled into
          9's arms. There is a brief moment of awkwardness as 1 and 9
          realize how close they are physically to each other.

          1 begins to climb up the side of the wing, using dangling 9
          and 7 as a ladder.
          
          Perched on top of 7's staff, 1 reaches up for 8, who is
          crouched on the edge of the buttress. He grabs 8's hand,
          gesturing imperiously to 8 to pull him up.
          9
            looks at 7 urgently, nodding to her. She gets it
          immediately and grabs 1's leg, stopping him.
                  86                                                        186

                       ourselves!
          
          The plane teeters down to a 90 degree angle. 5 and 6 look up
          at the rest of the ragdolls from farther down the wing. 5 is
          concerned and almost panicked. 6 is almost zen-peaceful, as
          though he can foresee it will be all right.
          
              looks around and sees the rope tied around 7's waist.
          
          
                           (TO 7)
                       Your rope.
          
          7 throws it down to 9 who ties it to his own waist. The plane
          tilts... it's hanging even more precariously now... about to
          fall out of the side of the Cathedral entirely...
          
          9 suddenly jumps down into the flames just as the plane
          starts to fall. 7 shouts with stress.
          
          The plane EXPLODES as it hits the ground, smoke rising from
          the crash. The rope pulls taut, and after the smoke settles
          we can see 9 dangling with 5 and 6.
          
          8 pulls the hanging chain of ragdolls up and onto the
          buttress fragment.
          
           s 1 recovers himself and straightens his hat, he glances
          up... towards the smouldering clock tower...

          The Seamstress has sewed the carcass of "2" into her tail in

          seamstress suddenly darts one of her claws out, GRABS 7, and
          SLITHERS OFF out through the library [ALT: through part of a

                      Machine.
          
          The twins look up and nod their agreement. While the others
          have been talking, they have found a book cover and have lain
          2's body on it. They now put the sword on top of 2 like a
          fallen soldier and put his hands on his chest holding the
          sword.

                      We have to go--all of us.   We have
                      to rescue them--

                      and for all.
          
            just bows his head.    He's still mourning 8.   9 gives him a
          compassionate look.
          
          They turn towards the twins, and see them pick up 1's coin
          and place it on top of 2's face. They see that the twins
          have prepared 2's body for burial.
          
           hey all bow their heads. The twins now slowly send 2
          floating down the remnants of water in the drainpipe at the
          bottom of the fountain.
          
          5 pulls out the piece of burlap from 2's back with his number
          on it. He hands it to 9.
          
              looks at 5, 9, and the twins soberly.
          
          They look at him.    Slowly, they nod, as though accepting
          their mission.
          
          1 sighs heavily. Suddenly he looks so very old, so very
          tired. He stares down at 2 floating away. Slowly, he nods
          as well.

          We pan down, and see SEEKER DRONES (that the newly vitalized
          Fabrication Machine has constructed) floating in the air
          around the factory, tirelessly looking for enemies. One of
          them floats near to camera and its searchlight fixes on
          something. We follow the light down.
          
          The light reveals a PUMPING OIL DERRICK, also newly awakened.
          Its pump moves up and down in sinister rhythm.
          
          The light moves away from the derrick. Camera stops
          following the light and keeps moving down, arriving at the
          ground where we now see, in the darkness--
          
          THE RAGDOLLS. They huddle behind an oil pipe waiting for the
          Seeker Drone to pass. 1 is weak, but is supported by 5, who
          has been patching him, and is just finishing up, pulling the
          last thread out of the patch he's sewn onto 1. 1 is
          regaining his strength. The twins huddle behind 6.
          
            looks out past the pumping derricks and sees AN ENTRANCE TO
          A COAL CHUTE.

              scowls.   5 nods, proudly taking the responsibility.
          
              darts purposefully towards the factory.
          
            looks around keenly, looking up for seeker drones, then
          runs out from cover, over to a huge barrel that lies half
          buried in the scorched earth.    A painting of the Dictator's
          symbol is stenciled on the side.
          
          He taps on the front. It is FULL. He looks up in the air at
          the seeker drones. They haven't seen him.
          
          We gestures to the others.
           e see the barrel is on top of a small hill that leads down
          to coal car tracks. The tracks lead to the open mouth of a
          coal chute that feeds into the factory.
          
          5 sees a bent spoon on the ground. He smiles, remembering 2
          and his ingenuity, and picks it up. He hands it to 1.

          With confidence now, he looks around. He sees a splintered
          pile of wood planks, the remains of a wooden derrick
          platform. He looks at the others and gestures to the wood.

          9 darts from hiding place to hiding place inside the darkened
          factory, moving towards the Fabrication Machine.
          
          He spots the half-blinded Seamstress and watches in HORROR as
          he sees that the Seamstress is giving 8 up to the Fabrication
          Machine. 9 is too late to do anything to stop the Machine
          from sucking 8's soul.
          
           here is a bright GREEN GLOW as 8's soul is sucked, and in
          the sudden illumination, 9 sees 7. She is sewn into the
          Seamstress--but is still alive!
          
           NGLE on 9 as he realizes she is still alive and he can still
          rescue her! From his hiding place he looks around for a way
          to rescue her. He inspects the machinery near him. He sees
          a LEVER and GEARS. He looks at his LIGHTSTAFF. He then
          spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the Winged
          Beast. We see he is formulating a plan. He darts his hand
          out to drag the fabric towards him.
          
           NGLE on the Fabrication Machine as it begins to power back
          up after taking 8's soul.
          
           NGLE on the Seamstress. She turns to get 7, and give her to
          the Fabrication Machine. We see the TERROR and DEFIANT FURY
          in 7's eyes, but she is immobilized and can do nothing.
          
          Suddenly the Seamstress hears a SOUND.   She whips around.
          P
           OV through the Seamstress's damaged eye: a MOVEMENT in the
          shadows.
          
           he Seamstress, distracted from her morbid mission with 7,
          slithers towards the movement.
          
          In the shadow we see a RAGDOLL with GLOWING EYES. 7 sees
          this and registers recognition, relief, and also TERROR at
          what will be 9's fate. But she is unable to move or speak
          and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked
          out, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slithers
          closer and closer to its prey. We see the misery on 7's
          face.
          
          The seamstress raises her needles and STRIKES the ragdoll,
          sewing wildly.

          The ragdoll SWINGS OUT from a string attached to a lever.
          The lever now moves down (because of the weight of the
          ragdoll) and SWITCHES on machinery. Gears start to turn and
          we see the ragdoll is attached and begins to drag the trapped
          seamstress in, arms first.
          
           he gears CRUNCH the ragdoll. 7 FLINCHES... but then her
          expression turns to amazement as she suddenly sees it is not
          a ragdoll at all but is 9'S LIGHT-STAFF DRESSED IN FABRIC.
          Instinctively, she looks up, a sudden hopeful look on her
          face... just as
          
          9 SWINGS IN and lands on the SEAMSTRESS, tearing a hole in
          her back. He slides down the length of her body, FREEING 7.
          
          7 and 9 fall to the ground as the gears now CRUSH THE
          SEAMSTRESS.

          5, 1, 6, and the twins crouch behind the barrel. We see they
          have built two paths of wooden boards leading down to the
          entrance of the coal chute, have dug a trench under the
          barrel, and have placed a long bar of metal beneath the
          barrel.

                    PULL!
          
          They all pull down with all their weight. The barrel lifts
          and teeters, then tips and RACES DOWN THE HILL. At the
          bottom, it launches off the boards, spinning into the air and
          landing on the rails to the coal chute with a sparking crash.
          
           he ragdolls race down after it.
          
          The barrel rolls and comes to a stop right at the mouth of
          the coal chute.

          1 strikes the match on the side of the oil barrel and is
          about to light the rag. 5 grabs his arm.

                    No!    Not yet--
          
          They tussle over the lighted match when suddenly--
          
                              9'S VOICE
                    What did I tell you?      Light it!
                    Now!
          
          7 and 9 run towards them. The eyes of the spiders can be
          seen right behind them. 1 looks at the burning match in his
          hands, thinking about what he almost did...

          1 sets the rag on fire. The ragdolls jump behind the barrel
          and PUSH it into the tunnel. 7 and 9 just make it, leaping
          out of the tunnel as the flaming barrel HURTLES down the
          tunnel--DRAGGING the SEEKER DRONE with it--crunching over the
          unseen Beasts--and landing in the factory and --
          
          BLAM!!!!
          
          THE FACTORY EXPLODES.

          9 warmly clasps her arm. She pats his hand.     They look with
          great affection and appreciation at each other.
          
          The twins chatter: they've found an old Victrola lying in the
          debris, with an old warped record still on it. They climb
          onto the record, tripping the needle arm onto the disc, and
          begin walking on the record.
          
          A scratchy old melody comes from the large Victrola
          amplifying horn. 7 smiles at the sound of the music. She
          leaps on the record, joining them. As they walk faster, the
          music speeds up.
          
          1 comes up behind them. He looks deep in thought.     He
          catches his hat as it begins to slip off his head.

          over towards the others. But 9, seeing 1's contemplative
          mood, stops next to 1. 1 looks up at him.

          9 looks at 1, not sure how to respond. 1 now also sees 2's
          old staff that 9 is still holding onto.
          
          He looks over at 9.

          next to him.
          
          
                      We've both made mistakes.

          They look at each other for a beat, then look over to the
          others, relaxing together on the Victrola.
          
            holds out his hand to 1. 1 gives 9 his hand and 9 helps
          him up. As 1 stands, his heavy headpiece falls off and
          shatters.
          
            looks in horror.    But 1 just looks at it, shrugging and
          slightly smiling.

           e now runs his hand over his head, which we now see has a
          funny looking pony-tail like protuberance.   9 hesitates,
          then can't help CHUCKLING. 1 sees him, then starts to LAUGH
          as well.
          
          9 and 1 go over together to the Victrola. 7 notices as 9
          helps 1 climb up on the Victrola and starts to celebrate.
          
          9 joins 7 near the needle and 6 sits on the crank as it spins
          around. Everyone is enjoying the music.

          then down the hill. 5 runs after it.

          slightly.

          They leap off the spinning Victrola, hitting the needle and
          the music SCRATCHES TO A HALT.

          5 faces the Machine as the green of the TALISMAN shoots out
          at him, sucking his soul into its portal. The Machine's eye
          turns green showing it has absorbed the soul, then back to
          glowing red.

          The Machine again SHAKES and then seems momentarily paralyzed
          as it ingests the soul, giving the ragdolls a moment to flee,
          scrambling, desperately trying to get up the hill and escape.
          1 looks over to the bridge. His general's instincts kick
          back in.

          The bridge starts to give way 9 and 7 run to the other side.
          9's light staff slides and falls down into the dark crevice.
          
          The Fabrication Machine is now hanging off of one side of the
          bridge, still holding on to 6.

          The Fabrication Machine tries to back up on the bridge but
          ends up getting caught in the beams, which form a cage around
          him. The other ragdolls yell to 6 from the other side of the
          bridge.
          
          The Fabrication Machine brings 6 up to its eye.

           e sees the machine that he fell out of.      He sees diagrams.
          
          He sees a journal, with drawings and thoughts. The drawings
          include: the original machine... the talisman... sketches of
          the dolls... the diagram that we saw in the Library
          manuscript...

          slightly altered if necessary for our uses here; if we still
          want to hear the radio it should be mixed in very low, so we
          are aware of it but it doesn't interfere with the scientist's
          dialogue. This is constructed so the scientist can be in
          V.O. only until the end, but if possible we can also see the
          back of the scientist in the first few pieces of footage].

          The scientist puts the strange face mask on and 9's POV is
          suffused with a GREEN GLOW.   The talisman clicks shut, the
          soul transfer completed. We hear the scientist fall to the
          ground, his soul depleted.
          
           ACK TO PRESENT TIME:
          
          9 comes out of his vision. He looks over the side of the
          table at the dead scientist.
          
              walks to the scientist and stares at the dead man.
          
          
                           (finally realizing it;

                      You.    You're the source...
          
          He reaches out to the skeletal hand clutching the box, then
          simply touches the Scientist's hand, tenderly. He looks up,
          a new, resolute look in his eyes.

                      The Scientist! The one who made
                      the machine. He gave us life too.

                    How?
          
          9 pauses at the enormity of it.      Finally:
          
                              9
                    He... he used his own soul.

                    That's why the machine is hunting
                    us. It was warped, reprogrammed to
                    hunt humanity. It, and the
                    machines it made, killed
                    everything. Except us.

          Suddenly the ground starts to shake. We hear the machine
          approaching. 1, 7, and the twins run to the missile.

                    No!    Don't destroy it!
          
          
                    What? It's hunting us! It'll
                    never stop! You said it yourself!
          
                             9
                    No. First we have to get them
                    back.

                                9
                    It isn't.    I have an idea.

          The Fabrication Machine appears from BEHIND THE CANNON. The
          ragdolls are CAUGHT OFF GUARD and scramble to get away just
          as its claw SMASHES down, DEMOLISHING THE CANNON.
          
          The dolls fly back from the blast. 9 is the only one
          standing. 9 deliberately walks towards the Machine. 7
          rushes over, trying to pull him away.

          The Machine swipes at 9 with its claw. 7 tries to stop it
          from getting 9. The Machine sends her flying. She lands
          badly and can't get up immediately. The Machine regroups,
          then begins to re-approach 9. 9 stays put.

                    Yes, it does. You'll see.      I'll
                    let it take my soul. Then

                      What right did they have to burden
                      us? Why did we have to right their
                      wrongs? So I refused. I refused
                      our path. But now... I see... we
                      cannot refuse it.   We are all
                      that's left.   We must complete
                      our journey.

           ith a horrible green glow the machine TAKES HIS SOUL.     The

                      NO--NO--
          
          But the machine RISES UP TERRIFYINGLY. It looks for a moment
          as though 9 was wrong and they're all going to be killed.
          They all cringe with horror.
          
          But then, as 9 had remembered, the Machine powers down to
          "digest" 1's soul.
          9
              darts in and GRABS the TALISMAN.

          crumples, dead. Sparks and smoke spew from it. Oil bubbles
          down its sides. It is lifeless--just a pile of jumbled
          machinery.

          Smoke rises from the center of a funeral pyre the dolls have
          made.
          
           t is a circular pyre, with spokes reaching out from the
          center.
          
          At the end of each spoke is the burlap skin of one of the
          fallen ragdolls, with its number stretched across a pole.
          
          In the center, a small FIRE flickers.
          
          9 stands in front of the last pole, holding 5's skin in his
          hands. He looks down at it in his hands and sadly places it
          upon the pole, looking up towards it.
          
           he twins come in with artifacts from the Scientist's studio.
          The journal. The tiny box. They put them down to the side.
          
            and 7 take the Talisman and place it IN THE CENTER, in
          front of the fire.
          
           he Talisman pulsates, vibrates, and shakes, and, finally
          BURSTS. A huge GREEN GLOW reaches up to the sky and the
          ragdolls' souls emerge.
          
          8 emerges and walks to his number. He nods to 9, 7, and the
          twins. They nod back, acknowledging the fierce warrior.
          
          2 comes out with 5 close behind.   5 places an arm around 2.
          
            emerges from the Talisman energy.   He sees his key and
          caresses it.
          
          1 emerges and comes over to stand next to 9. He nods,
          acknowledging that 9 has finally completed the mission.     He
          looks up to the sky. The others follow his gaze.
          
          Together, spirits and living, they all watch together, and
          watch as the beam shoots up to the sky. We see THE SKY
          CHANGING, HEALING, RENEWING ITSELF.
          
          A healing rain begins to fall.

          The souls of the slain ragdolls now rise and dissipate into
          the healing energy.
          
          9 and 7 watch.   7 puts her arm around 9.
          
          The twins chatter: they've taken 6's key and tried it in the
          little box's keyhole. It opens the box. 7 and 9 go over as
          the box is opened:
          
          It is a music box.
          
          As they see themselves reflected in it, they see the word
          "HOPE."
          
          Camera pulls back slowly... revealing a tiny tendril of green
          grass growing.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:


A1   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE            A1

     A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an
     endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy."
     They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they
     pompously begin their umpteenth verse,
     THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past
     the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows,
     weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF

     where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY,
     PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler,
     gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH
     over the edge.

     AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE


     BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN.

     C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK --

     The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY
     HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour.
     In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a
     MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet
     and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage.
     One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward
     seven o'clock.



     IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a
     MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and
     down.
     Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop
     where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine.
     The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL
     LURCH appears and begins sweeping.
     Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the
     full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back
     of the clock.
     Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall.

     He runs past a couple of doors, past a pair of LEGS in
     pajamas, feet in bedroom slippers. He skids to a halt
     and BACK TRACKS to the legs. He pulls on the cuff of
     the pajama bottoms. They belong to GOMEZ, who stands
     in the doorway to

A2   INT. FESTER'S ROOM                                         A2

     Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas.
     Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar.
     Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the moment,
     he radiates unfathomable woe.

                              GOMEZ

                Think of it, Thing. He's been gone
                for twenty-five years. For twenty-
                five years we've attempted to
                contact Fester in the great
                beyond...
     The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine
     to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the
     doorway.
     The room has remained untouched since Fester's
     disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust
     and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth
     - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports
     trophies, a high school photo with all the other students
     keeping as much distance from Fester as possible.
     As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room:

                              GOMEZ

                ... And for twenty-five years,
                nothing. Not a whisper, not a
                clue. I'm beginning to think my
                my brother truly is lost.
     Gomez sighs.   Thing TUGS at his cuff, pulling him towards
     the

               Look at her -- I would die for her.
               I would kill for her. Either way
               -- what bliss.
     Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles
     are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is
     offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair
     is spread like a diabolic halo. A dark Garbo, sultry
     and remote, she's a ruined beauty.
     Morticia OPENS HER EYES.

     Pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized
     chemistry set.
     The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's
     collected -- "Bridge Out!", "Detour! Excavation Ahead!",
     "Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!"
     SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked
     in the corner.



     In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING

     FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA.

     This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has
     every chance of growing up to be the public monster his
     parents would be proud of.
     He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin-
     ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down.
     He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma-
     tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he
     crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

     hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool
     among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A

     STRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR.

     The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head
     through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in
     the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in.
     Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string.

                             WEDNESDAY

      Morticia is looking for her children. She discovers
      Pugsley ASLEEP, curled up on the SILVER PLATTER WHERE THE
      TWO-HEADED PIG LAY. She finds this enchanting.
      Gomez enters.   Morticia shushes him; she points to the
      platter.

                             MORTICIA

                      (whispering)

               So sweet. He looks just... like
               a little entree.
      Pugsley wakes up; he looks around.

      Gomez rallies the family for the search. Morticia wears
      a black cloak. Granny has grabbed her divining rod.
      Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting
      instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map
      of the area.

                             GOMEZ

               Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung
               heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow
               graves. I'll take the abyss, and
               Lurch - check the bottomless pit.

      They look up at Fester, looking down at them from
      Wednesday's window.

                             GOMEZ

               Fester! You take the ravine!     And

                  That's the spirit, Thing - lend a

      sitting in an armchair, basking in the rays of sunshine
      that beam from a copy of "The Sun Also Rises." Tully

       Gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the
       cemetery. Two proud marble vultures guard the entryway.
       Gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and
       the stone doors slide open. He steps into -

       Inside it is catacomb-like, filled with the bleached
       bones of the Addams dead. Gomez's torch casts shadows
       -- one of which belongs to Wednesday, curled asleep on a
       stone sarcophagus. Relieved to find her, Gomez
       approaches quietly. He doesn't want to wake her up. He
       lifts her tenderly in his arms.

      Gate can't open. He rattles miserably on his hinges --
      locked tight with heavy chains and yellow police tape -
      large "NO TRESPASSING!! COURT ORDER!! ADDAMS FAMILY -

                 This is a restraining order, Gomez.

                 A restraining order?

                 It requires you to keep a distance of
                 one thousand yards from this house.
                 You've got about nine hundred and
                 ninety-nine yards to go - catch my

                 Not your house, moustache! Not any
                 more! It belongs to the eldest living
                 descendant, the older of the brothers

                 But he isn't even Uncle Fester.

                 They say a man who represents
                 himself has a fool for a client.

                Given applicable standards of
                proof, the attempts to impugn this
                man's character or question his

                executor of the Addams estate and

      possessions.

      GOMEZ

      already sits in the passenger seat of the Duesenberg, his
      coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid,
      his head thrown back.
      Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant. Granny
      carries her favorite cauldron, Wednesday one of her Marie
      Antoinette dolls, Pugsley his chemistry set. Lurch uproots
      his favorite tree and joins the procession. Thing follows,
      dragging a toy wagon packed with his rings, his glove.

      The Duesenberg eases out of the driveway and onto the

      Morticia leans into frame. With an icepick and a hammer,
      she deftly makes a large spidery CRACK in the round mirror.
      Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork.
      Granny joins her.

                I like it.
      Her mother pats her consolingly.

                Just as long as we're together,
                n'est pas, mon cher?
      As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow
      -- all ersatz cowboy and Indian mixed with chrome-plated
      plastic and orange shag carpet.

      GOMEZ

      sits slumped in a   chair made from wagon wheel and nauga-
      hyde. It's as if    all of his insane, vibrant energy has
      been leeched from   him. He's a broken man. He looks back
      at her as if he's   never heard French.

                                GOMEZ

                Huh?
      Wednesday tends to him.    She and her mother exchange a
      worried look.

      PUGSLEY

      comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel
      soap.

                              PUGSLEY

                This place isn't so bad. They even
                put candy in the bathroom.

                 But maybe I'll have one of those...
       He takes a bar of soap from Pugsley.     Gomez unwraps it
       and morosely eats.

                beverages. Organically grown, with
                no preservatives. Are you sure

       White clapboard. Geraniums in the flower boxes.
       Surrounded by a white picket fence.



       Carrying his SAMPLE VACUUM CLEANER AND BUCKET, the tools of
       his new trade, Lurch carefully opens the little white gate.

       AT THE DOOR,

       he rings the doorbell, afraid he might break something.
       A BLONDE HOUSEWIFE in tennis whites, obviously in a hurry,
       opens the door -- only to be greeted by a BUCKETFUL OF
       SLOP thrown past her, onto her peach Oriental rug. She
       SCREAMS in horror, turns to challenge the perpetrator of
       this atrocity and, seeing Lurch, SCREAMS again.
       In a panic, she tries to slam the door on Lurch, but, like
       the salesman's manual undoubtedly advised, he STICKS his
       foot in the way. The door partially RIPS off its hinges.
       Lurch steps inside and shuts the door as best he can.
       A moment passes. The door swings open and Lurch exits,
       jauntily waving a check.

        Morticia, just outside Gate, struggles to get it open,
        Thing clutching the bars, also attempting to block her
        way.

                                MORTICIA

                  Stop it, you two.
        Morticia breaks free of Thing.

        the sight of Morticia on the stoop.

                                MORTICIA

                  I would like to speak with Fester.
        Tully steps aside.

        Morticia crosses the threshold.

155   EXT. INTERSECTION AT THE FOOT OF THE ADDAMS HILL - NIGHT 155

      Thing does his damnedest to flag down any of the few
      oncoming cars. He waves to no avail, DANCES AROUND in
      frustration, then tries HITCHHIKING, sticking out his
      thumb. A passing car splashes him with mud.
      Screwing up his courage, in a kamikaze leap, he GRABS
      ahold of the bumper of the next car that comes along and
      hangs on for dear life as the car SPEEDS down the street.

      Morticia is now stretched out on the torture RACK. Fester
      and Tully are securing her hands and feet, under Abigail's
      supervision. Fester seems torn, agitated, upset.

                             MORTICIA

                      (to Abigail, graciously)
               You are a desperate woman, consumed
               by greed and infinite bitterness.
                      (a beat)
               We could have been such friends.

                             ABIGAIL

               you. I pity you. Persecution,
               fiendish torture, inhuman depravity -
               sometimes it's just not enough.

               I'd love to, you know that, but -
               I've got this stomach thing. When I
               torture people. It's just me.

      Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. Morticia's
      bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She
      MOANS, rather sensually.

                               ABIGAIL

               Again!
      Tully tightens the rack again. More BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS again, even more orgasmically.

               Tighter!
      Tully tightens the rack a third time. BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS, very voluptuously. She opens her eyes.
      She sighs, in afterglow. She glances at Tully.

                             MORTICIA

                      (to Tully, flirtatiously)
               You've done this before.

      Thing leaps dramatically onto the porch, then stops dead
      to knock on the cabin door.
      After a beat:

                                GOMEZ (O.S.)

               Who is it?     We're paid through

                               FESTER

                 But, Mother can't we...
      Gomez reaches for the book that will open the secret
      panel:

                               ABIGAIL

                 Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your
                 feet! You disgust me - you're nothing
                 but a useless, snivelling baby! A
                 stone around my neck! What was I
                 thinking - I should've left you where
                 I found you!
      At Abigail's final words, Fester suddenly LEAPS FORWARD.

                               FESTER

                 No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong
                 book!

      CLOSE UP

      Gomez's hand is on the right book, "Greed," but Fester
      stops him from pulling it.




                                 FESTER

                 Allow me...
      Gomez looks into Fester's eyes -- realizing what he's
      about to do.

                               GOMEZ

                        (murmuring)
                 Good show, old man...
      Fester reaches for a DIFFERENT BOOK -- "Hurricane Irene:
      Nightmare from Above."
      Seeing the title of the book, Tully suddenly panics:

               Put that book down, Gordon! You
               don't know what it can do! It's
               not just literture!

                             FESTER

                      (advancing on Tully)
               Oh, really?

                             TULLY

               I'm your friend, Gordon - think
               of the doubloons!

                             FESTER

               They're not yours, Tully!     Back off!



      ANGLE on Gomez, releasing Morticia from the torture wheel.

                             MORTICIA

               Quickly, my darling!
      He helps her down from the wheel.

                             GOMEZ

               Leather straps, red-hot pokers...

                             MORTICIA

               Later, my dearest.
      ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers.

                             ABIGAIL

               Keep the book closed, Gordon -
               listen to mother!

                             FESTER

               I'll never listen to you - not
               ever again!

                             ABIGAIL

               I had to be strict with you -
               because I cared! Put it down!

                             FESTER

               You never really loved me!
      ANGLE on Gomez and Morticia, nearing the bookcase.

                             GOMEZ

               Come, my love - to safety!

                 You're a terrible mother!   There,
                 I said it!
       Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window.
       Then he blasts Abigail out as well.
       ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed",
       to open the bookshelf. Amid the storm, he is leading
       Morticia behind the bookshelf. He tries to hold the
       bookshelf open for Fester to follow, fighting the gale
       force winds.

                               GOMEZ

                        (calling out to Fester)
                 Old man! This way!
       ANGLE ON THING, across the room, struggling across the
       floor toward the bookshelf. Thing fights the wind,
       which pelts him with papers and other flying debris.
       Gomez can no longer fight the storm, and the bookshelf
       slams shut. Fester desperately tries to close the book to
       quell the storm, but a HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ZAPS HIM.
       He falls to the floor, with electricity coursing through
       him.



       MOVE IN on the storm raging within the pages of the book,
       then -

174   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION, NEXT OCTOBER - NIGHT                174

      A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There
      is a hand-lettered sign on the door reading "HALLOWEEN
      OPEN HOUSE." The children are dressed in traditional
      Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton,
      etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle
      and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and
      he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the
      children CHANT:

                             CHILDREN

               Trick or...
      They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened
      the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM
      IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street.




                                                  CUT TO:

175   INT. FRONT HALL - SAME TIME                               175

      Lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled.
      The family is busily decorating the house for their annual
      Halloween festivities. All the decorations are elegant
      yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the
      chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o-
      lanterns. Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from
      the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are
      clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with
      cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters
      and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe
      paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each
      holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and
      the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans
      against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat.
      A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the
      letters drip with blood.
      Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony.   Morticia hands
      him a decoration.
      Granny appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food.

                             GRANNY

               Well, it's their loss. I even
               made finger sandwiches.
      Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear.

                             FESTER

                      (petting Thing)
               Oh, calm down.

                               PUGSLEY (O.S.)

               Here we come!



      Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday
      is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as
      a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND
      GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down
      onto his feet.

                             GOMEZ

               Pugsley, old man!

                             MORTICIA

                      (delighted)
               Look at you.

                             PUGSLEY

                      (to Uncle Fester)
               How do you like it?
      Fester is very touched; he picks Pugsley up.

               Oh yes - in the den.

      Everyone starts to move toward the den. There is a KNOCK
      on the door. Everyone turns. Lurch opens the door.
      Standing outside are Margaret and Cousin It. Margaret is
      dressed as a fairy princess, complete with wand. Cousin
      It wears a cowboy hat, a bandanna and a holster. Margaret
      is radiant, obviously very much in love.

                             MARGARET

               Hello, Margaret. Cousin It - I
               almost didn't recognize you.

                             MARGARET

               Isn't he handsome? Everyone keeps
               asking where he bought his costume.

                             GOMEZ

                      (admiringly)
               It is a wonderful hat.

               And what are you, darling?   Where's
               your costume?

                             WEDNESDAY

                      (solemnly)
               This is my costume. I'm a homicidal
               maniac. They look just like everyone
               else.

      Fester and Pugsley are posed at one end of the room.
      Lurch has set up an easel and canvas; he is painting
      Fester and Pugsley's portrait.
      Gomez and Wednesday are sitting on the floor amid
      newspapers, carving a pumpkin.
      Morticia is knitting. Margaret and Cousin It sit together,
      holding hands. Granny brings people cups of steaming
      punch, from a punch bowl.

               Halloween - it's such a special
               time. Ghosts and goblins. Witches
               on broomsticks.

               Now that I've got my memory back.

               You know, all the old sayings are
               true. There's no place like home.
               And blood is thicker than water.




                             MORTICIA

               And just as refreshing.

                             GOMEZ

               All right, everybody - time for a
               game! What shall it be - bobbing
               for apples?

                             MARGARET

               Charades?

                             COUSIN IT

               Ooot glibber glip.

                             MORTICIA

               Of course - "Wake The Dead."

                             FESTER

                      (delighted, to Gomez
                       remembering this childhood
                       favorite)
               "Wake The Dead"!

                             GOMEZ

                      (equally excited)
               "Wake The Dead"! Out to the cemetery!
               Come on, everyone!
      Everyone starts to exit, chattering happily.

                             MARGARET

                      (to Granny)
               I've never played this before -
               how does it go?

                             GRANNY

               Did you bring a shovel?

                             PUGSLEY

               Uncle Fester, will you be on my team?

                               WEDNESDAY

               No, mine!

                             FESTER

                      (to Wednesday)
               I tell you what - we'll give you a
               head start. Three skulls and a
               pelvis - how's that?
      Pugsley and Wednesday cheer and run out.   Fester faces
      Gomez.




                             FESTER

               My own dear brother - who could be
               more precious?

                             GOMEZ

               Blood is thicker than water, old man.

                             MORTICIA

                      (touched by the
                       brothers devotion)
               And just as refreshing.
      Gomez offers his hand.   Fester takes it, in a manly
      handshake.

                             GOMEZ

               Let us never be parted.

                             FESTER

               Let us always be as one.



      Fester flips Gomez in a JUDO FLIP.
      Gomez LANDS -
      At the foot of a glass display case. The camera pans up
      the case. It contains ABIGAIL AND TULLY, EXPERTLY

      MOUNTED AND STUFFED.

      Fester rises, dusting himself off.

                             FESTER

                      (joyfully, to Gomez
                       and Morticia)
               Come on!

                             MORTICIA

               We'll catch up.
      Fester runs out.

      Everyone is gone. Morticia and Gomez have drifted into
      the front hall; they are moving toward the front door.

                              MORTICIA

                       (deeply satisfied)
                Our family... what are they?

                              GOMEZ

                Oh, Tish - what a night. Everyone
                -- together at last. What more
                could we ask?




                             MORTICIA

                Gomez?
      Morticia holds up the garment she's been knitting - it's
      a BABY JUMPER WITH THREE LEGS.

                              GOMEZ

                       (ecstatic)

                Oui, mon cher...
      They embrace, as the front door SWINGS OPEN, of its own

      Morticia and Gomez are silhouetted in the doorway. There
      is a FULL MOON. In the distance, a wolf HOWLS. Wispy
      GHOSTS flit through the night sky. A human SCREAM is
      heard, followed by Granny's CACKLE. In the cemetery,
      torches are seen, like fireflies.

ALADDIN:  THE COMPLETE SCRIPT
COMPILED BY BEN SCRIPPS <34RQNPQ@CMUVM.CSV.CMICH.EDU>
(Portions Copyright (c) 1992 The Walt Disney Company

PEDDLER:    Oh I come from a land
    From a faraway place
    Where the caravan camels roam
    Where they cut off your ear /Where it's flat and immense
    If they don't like your face /And the heat is intense
    It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!
    When the wind's at your back
    And the sun's from the west
    And the sand in the glass is right
    Come on down,
    Stop on by
    Hop a carpet and fly
    To another Arabian night!

    Arabian nights
    Like Arabian days
    More often than not
    Are hotter than hot
    In a lot of good ways

    Arabian nights
    'Neath Arabian moons
    A fool off his guard
    Could fall and fall hard
    Out there on the dunes.

    Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend.
    Please, please, come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting
    peddler in face) Too close, a little too close.  (Camera
    zooms back out to CU)There.Welcome to Agrabah.  City of
    mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this
    side of the river Jordan, on sale today, come on down!
    Heh, heh.  Look at this! Yes!  Combination hookah and
    coffee maker--also makes Julienne fries.  Will not break
    (taps it on table), will not--(it falls apart)--it
    broke.  Ooohhh!  Look at this! Pulls out Tupperware) I
    have never seen one of these intact before.  This is the
    famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.  (Pries it open,
    makes raspberry sound.)  Ah, still good. (Camera begins
    to pan to right.  PEDDLER hurries to catch it.)  Wait,
    don't go!  (Stop pan.)I can see that you're only
    interested in the exceptionally rare.  I think then, you
    would be most rewarded to consider...this.  (PEDDLER
    pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve.) Do not be
    fooled by its commonplace appearance.  Like so many
    things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside
    that counts.  (Another pan, this one slower to left.
    Again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.)  This is no ordinary
    lamp!  It once changed the course of a young man's life.
    A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he
    seemed.  A diamond in the rough.  Perhaps you would like
    to hear the tale?  (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the
    lamp into his hand.)  It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER
    throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry
    nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a dark
    purpose.

(Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
    on his shoulder.  GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair.)

JAFAR:  You...are late.
GAZEEM:A thousand apologies, O patient one.
JAFAR:  You have it, then?
GAZEEM:I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out
        half of the medallion.  JAFAR reaches out for it,
        but GAZEEM yanks it back.)  Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure!
        (IAGO squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.)  Ouch!
JAFAR:  Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's
        coming to you.
IAGO:   What's coming to you!  Awk!

(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects
    them, and the insect medallion begins to glow.  Finally, it
    flies out of JAFAR's hand, scaring the horses, and is off
    towards the dunes.)

JAFAR:  Quickly, follow the trail!

(All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until
    it reaches a large dune.  It separates into two and the
    halves plunge into the dune.  All that remains are two glowing
    points of light on the dune.  But then the dune begins to rise
     up, transforming into a giant lion's head, with the glowing
    points serving as the eyes.)

JAFAR:  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave
        of wonders!
IAGO:       Awk!  Cave of wonders!
GAZEEM: By Allah!
JAFAR:  Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the
        treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!

(GAZEEM starts to approach the lion's mouth, which forms the
    entrance to the cave.  He chuckles as he goes.)

IAGO:   Awk, the lamp!  Awk,  the lamp!  (Now that IAGO and
    JAFAR are alone, IAGO opens up in normal English.)
    Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?

(JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and shushes him.  GAZEEM reaches
    the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave's speaking.)

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
GAZEEM: It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
CAVE:       Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose
        worth lies far within.  A diamond in the rough.

(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look.)

JAFAR:  What are you waiting for?  Go on!

(GAZEEM hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave.  With
    great apprehension, he plants his foot down.  Nothing happens.
      Relieved, he begins his trek again.  Then another roar comes.
     He turns back, but the lion's mouth slams shut and the dune
    collapses back to normal.  All that are left are JAFAR, IAGO,
     and the two separated halves of the medallion.)

CAVE:       Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough.

(IAGO unburied himself from the sand, coughing as he does so.)

IAGO:       I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it. We're
        never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!  Just
        forget it.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I'm so
        ticked off that I'm molting!  (He flies up to
        JAFAR's shoulder.)
JAFAR:  Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously
        less than worthy.
IAGO:       (Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there's a big
        surprise.  That's an incred--I think I'm gonna have
        a heart attack and die from not surprise!  What're
        we gonna do?  We got a big problem here,a big prob-
        (JAFAR pinches his beak shut.)
JAFAR:  Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this
        one, this...diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a rooftop, where ALADDIN rushes up to the edge, carrying
    a loaf of bread.  He almost drops it over the edge.)

GUARD:  Stop, thief!  I'll have your hands for a trophy,
        street rat!
ALADDIN:    (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.)  All
        this for a loaf of bread?

(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with
    drying clothes on them.  He skies down them, collecting bits
    and pieces of clothing on him as he goes.  Finally, he's
    nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches
     out and slams the shutters closed.  ALADDIN slams into the
    shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by
    numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.  He pulls
     off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread
    when...)

GUARD 1:    There he is!
GUARD 2:    You won't get away so easy!
ALADDIN:    You think that was easy?

(He looks at three women, laughing at him.)

GUARD 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We'll
        find him.

(ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise.
    He rushes over to the women.)

ALADDIN:    Morning, ladies.
WOMAN 1:    Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't
        we Aladdin?
ALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you
        get caught--

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and yanks him back.  It's the
    first GUARD.  ALADDIN's disguise falls off.)

ALADDIN:    I'm in trouble!
GUARD:  ...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU,
        then the guard's turban is pulled down over his
        eyes.  ABU dances on the GUARD's head, laughing.)
ALADDIN:    Perfect timing, Abu!
ABU:        Hello!
ALADDIN:    Come on, let's get outta here!
        Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline
        One swing ahead of the sword
        I steal only what I can't afford
        That's everything!

(ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of
    swings, then pulls down the GUARD's pants.  ABU raspberries the
    GUARD, then dodges an attack.  The GUARD swings at ALADDIN,
    but destroys a barrel of fish.  As ALADDIN runs off, the GUARD
     pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.)

        One jump ahead of the lawmen
        That's all, and that's no joke
        These guys don't appreciate I'm broke!

(ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down
    on top of another GUARD.)

GUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!
        Scoundrel! Take that!
ALADDIN:    Just a little snack, guys!

(ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the
    platform back and fro trying to knock him off.)

GUARDS: Rip him open, take it back guys!
ALADDIN:    I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
        You're my only friend, Abu!
WOMEN:  Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab ABU's
    hands like an acrobat.  The pair swing into a harem.)

        Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
        He's become a one-man rise in crime

(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a
    chipmunk.)

WOMAN:  I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!
ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
        Tell you all about it when I got the time!

(ALADDIN and ABU exit.  Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd.  The
    GUARDS rush past.  Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN,
     matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered.)

        One jump ahead of the slowpokes
        One skip ahead of my doom
        Next time gonna use a nom de plume.
        One jump ahead of the hitmen
        One hit ahead of the flock
        I think I'll take a stroll around the block.

(A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS,
    race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a MAN sleeping on a bed of
    nails {of course one extremely large GUARD lands on him}.  ABU
     disguises himself with jewels until a SHOPKEEPER discovers him.

CROWD:  Stop, thief! Vandal!
        Outrage! Scandal!
ALADDIN:    Let's not be too hasty

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens
    and a large, ugly LADY comes out.)

LADY:   Still I think he's rather tasty

(ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting
    like they're all chums.)

ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
        Otherwise we'd get along!
GUARDS: WRONG!

(They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and
    ABU are gone.  They are sneaking away in barrels.  They run
    across a flaming pit, followed by GUARDS who hop up and down,
    screaming in pain as they cross the rocks.  ALADDIN and ABU
    pass a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU goes back, pulls the sword
    out of the SWALLOWER's mouth.  ABU advances on the guards,
    who retreat in fear.)

GUARD 1:    He's got a sword!
GUARD 2:    You idiot--we've ALL got swords!!

(ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are
    once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right.
      He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street,
     as the GUARDS all crash into each other.)

ALADDIN:    One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!
CROWD:  Vandal!
ALADDIN:    One hop ahead of the hump!
CROWD:  Street rat!
ALADDIN:    One trick ahead of disaster
CROWD:  Scoundrel!
ALADDIN:    They're quick--but I'm much faster
CROWD:  Take that!

(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a
     carpet and jumps out the window)

ALADDIN:    Here goes, better throw my hand in
        Wish me happy landin'
        All I gotta do is jump!

(The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to
     the street, and land in a pile with the sign "Crazy Hakim's
    Discount Fertilizer."  ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
    to land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each
    other.)

ALADDIN:    And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!

(ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins
    to eat.  But ALADDIN looks over and sees two young children
    rummaging through the garbage for food.  The GIRL sees him, then
    drops her find and tries to hide.  ALADDIN looks at them, then
    the bread, then at ABU.)

ABU:        Uh-oh!

(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks
    over to the children.  The GIRL pulls her brother back.)

ALADDIN:    Here, go on--take it.

(The children giggle with delight.  ABU tries to swallow his bite,
    then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers his
     bread to them.  In delight, they pet him on the head.)

ABU:        Ah, don't.  Huh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade
    going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people.  He sees
    PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)

BYSTANDER 1:    On his way to the palace, I suppose.
BYSTANDER 2:    Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the
    alley. The BOY runs out in front of the PRINCE's horse,
    startling it.)

PRINCE: Out of my way, you filthy brat!

(The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
    jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)

ALADDIN:    Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners
PRINCE: Oh--I teach you some manners!

(The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.)

ALADDIN:    Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a
        horse with two rear ends!

(The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a
        street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only
        your fleas will mourn you.

(ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut
    in his face.)

ALADDIN:    I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come
        on, Abu.  Let's go home.

(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in
    ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN:    Riffraff, street rat.
        I don't buy that.
        If only they'd look closer
        Would they see a poor boy?  No siree.
        They'd find out, there's so much more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.)

        Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.  We'll be
        rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems
        at all.

(Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber.
     The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the
    rear end of his pants.)

PRINCE: I've never been so insulted!

SULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are
        you?

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her off!

SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes
        off into the garden looking for his daughter.  He
        finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's
        pet tiger, who blocks him off.  RAJAH has a piece
        of the PRINCE's undershorts in his mouth.The SULTAN
        grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH's mouth.)
        Confound it, Rajah!  So, this is why Prince Achmed
        stormed out!
JASMINE:    Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him,
        weren't you Rajah.  (RAJAH comes over and allows
        JASMINE to pet and hug him.)  You were just playing
        with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
        weren't you?  (She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the
        moment, until she looks up at her angry father. )
        Ahem.
SULTAN: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor
        that comes to call.  The law says you...
BOTH:       ...must be married to a prince.

(They walk over to a dove cage.)

SULTAN: By your next birthday.
JASMINE:    The law is wrong.
SULTAN: You've only got three more days!
JASMINE:    Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes
        a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry,
        I want it to be for love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him
        the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I'm not
        going to be around forever, and I just want to make
        sure you're taken care of, provided for.
JASMINE:    Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my
        own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the
        pond, petting the fish.)I've never had any real
        friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.)
        Except you, Rajah.  (Satisfied, he goes back to
        sleep.)  I've never even been outside the palace
        walls.
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you're a princess.
JASMINE:    Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She
        splashes the water.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any
        daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove
    cage and yanks open the door.  The birds fly off into freedom.
      She watches them go.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chambers.)

SULTAN: I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother
        wasn't nearly so picky.  (A shadow falls over him.
        He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.)  Ooh, oh.
        Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.  I am in
        desperate need of your wisdom.
JAFAR:  My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.)
SULTAN: It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to
        choose a husband.  I'm at my wit's-end.
IAGO:   (In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit's-end.
SULTAN: Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He
        pulls a cracker out from his pocket.  IAGO looks
        terrified.  Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGO's
        mouth.  IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it.  JAFAR
        and the SULTAN both laugh.)
JAFAR:  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
        (IAGO glares at him.)  Now then, perhaps I can
        divine a solution to this thorny problem.
SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.
JAFAR:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue
        diamond.
SULTAN: Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for
        years.
JAFAR:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
        (JAFAR says the word 'princess' with the accent on
        the second syllable, "cess."  He turns his staff
        with a cobra head towards the SULTAN.  The eyes of
        the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR's
        voice slows down and deepens.  The SULTAN's eyes
        get a hypnotized look.)  Don't worry.  Everything
        will be fine.
SULTAN: Everything...will be...fine.
JAFAR:  The diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.

(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns
    to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)

JAFAR:  You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and
        play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still hypnotized)  Yes...that'll be...pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they're out of the room,
    the parrot spits out the cracker.)

IAGO:       I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on
        one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam!
        Whack!

(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago.
IAGO:       Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!
JAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not
        that addlepated twit.
IAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha
        ha!

(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens
    at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE
    in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it.
      She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)

JASMINE:    Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and
        have my life lived for me.  I'll miss you.(She
        begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH,
        who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye!

(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN
    and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the
    awning of a fruit stand.)

ALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go!

(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)

PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds
            will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and
            hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey,
            get your paws off that.
ABU:            Blah blah blah!
PROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!

(He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN
    dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)

ABU:            Bye bye!

(He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front,
    where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like
    he has just done this.)

ALADDIN:    Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J
    ASMINE walking through the street.)

SHOPKEEPER 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass
            or silver.
SHOPKEEPER 2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar
            dates and pistachios!
SHOPKEEPER 3:   Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty
            necklace for a pretty lady.

(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust
    into her face.)

SHOPKEEPER 4:   Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
JASMINE:    I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into
        a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his
        fire.)  Oh, excuse me.  (He gulps, then belches
        fire from his mouth.  JASMINE is disgusted.  He is
        pleased and taps his stomach.  ALADDIN sees her,
        and a strange look comes over his face.)  I'm
        really very sorry.
ALADDIN:    (He's obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow!

(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and
    jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's
    face.)

ABU:        Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello?

(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child
    reaching for a piece of fruit.  She picks one up and gives it to
    him.)

JASMINE:        Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The
            boy runs off.)
PROPRIETOR: You'd better be able to pay for that.
JASMINE:        (Mystified) Pay?
PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart!
JASMINE:        Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money.
PROPRIETOR: Thief!
JASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can
            get some from the Sultan.
PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to
    chop it off.)

JASMINE:        No, no please!

(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN's.)

ALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found
            her. I've been looking all over for you.
JASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along.
PROPRIETOR: You know this girl?
JASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little
            crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear.
            She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by
            the vest.)
PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan!
ALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up.
    JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)

JASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?
ABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah.
ALADDIN:        Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking
            up another apple from the cart with his
            foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to
            Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the
            doctor.
JASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor.
            How are you?
ALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose
            pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls
    out.)

PROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can
            carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here,
            you little thieves!

(Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre
    contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)

IAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your
        rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
JAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the
        SULTAN's ring in the contraption.)
IAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one.

(IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing
    into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.)

JAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can
        enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of
        Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it
        shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by
        JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes, yes!
        There he is.  My diamond in the rough!
IAGO:       That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been
        waitin' for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked
        into the gears.)
JAFAR:  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to
        the palace, shall we?

(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)

IAGO:   Swell.

(JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with
    ALADDIN in it.  Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing
    to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)

ALADDIN:    Almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
    She stands up.)

JASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man.
ALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is
        your first time in the marketplace, huh?

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE:    Is it that obvious?
ALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her,
        still in love.  She returns the look.  But he
        realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.)
        I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous
        Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the
        buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned
        down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in
        surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both
        ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.)
JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof
        of a building, dodging planks and beams as they
        go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful.
JASMINE:    Is this where you live?
ALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.
JASMINE:    Fabulous.
ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and
        exposes the palace) but it's got a great view.
        Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful.
ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to
        have servants and valets...
JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how
        to dress.
ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food
        and ducking the guards.
JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so--
JASMINE:    You're just--
BOTH:       (in unison) --trapped.

(They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one
    another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the
    look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU's hand and rolls it down his
    arm into the hand of JASMINE.)

ALADDIN:    So, where're you from?
JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not
        going back.
ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his
        hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted
        look on his face.)
ABU:        Why you!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE:    My father's forcing me to get married.
ALADDIN:    That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the
        princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)

JASMINE:    What?
ALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.
ABU:        What?
JASMINE:    Oh did he?
ALADDIN:    Yeah, of course.
JASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do
        to help.
ABU:        Oh, boy!
JASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until
    ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however,
    by the GUARDS, who have found them.)

GUARD:  Here you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE:    They've found me!  (To each other) They're
                after you?
JASMINE:    My father must have sent them--
ALADDIN:    Do you trust me?
JASMINE:    What?
ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)
JASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.)
ALADDIN:    Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They
    try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)

GUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don't we,
        street rat?

(Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are
    here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and
     throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)

GUARD:  It's the dungeon for you, boy.
ALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me!
JASMINE:    Let go of him.
GUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we
        have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her
        down.)
JASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak)
        Unhand him, by order of the princess.

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

GUARD:  Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN:    The princess?
ABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess?
GUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with
        this street rat?
JASMINE:    That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release
        him!
GUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from
        Jafar.  You'll have to take it up with him.

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)

JASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I
        will.

(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He
    slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming
    in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside
    the door frame.)

JASMINE:    Jafar?
JAFAR:  Oh, uh, princess.
IAGO:       Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!
JAFAR:  How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his
        cape, hiding the door.)
JASMINE:    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your
        orders.
JAFAR:  Your father's charged me with keeping peace in
        Agrabah.  The boy was a criminal.
JASMINE:    What was the crime?
IAGO:       I can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
IAGO:       If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the
        door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!
JASMINE:    He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why
        frightfully upsetting.  Had I but known.
JASMINE:    What do you mean?
JAFAR:  Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried
        out.
JASMINE:    What sentence?
JAFAR:  (with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.)
        By beheading.
JASMINE:    No!  (She collapses to the floor.)
JAFAR:  I am exceedingly sorry, princess.
JASMINE:    How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.)

(IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on
    JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)

IAGO:       So, how did  it go?
JAFAR:  I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a
        sinister smile on their faces.)

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH
    comes over to comfort her.  She pets him.)

JASMINE:    It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his
        name.

(Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see
    ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN:    (to himself) She was the princess.  I don't believe
        it.  I must have sounded so stupid to her.
ABU:        (from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these.

(ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He
     wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an
     imitation of the princess.)

ALADDIN:    Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it.

(ABU jumps up on ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls a small set of tools
    out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)

ABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ALADDIN:    Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a
        street rat, remember, and there's a law. She's
        gotta marry a prince, she deserves it.

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.)

ABU:        Ta da!
ALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool
OLD MAN:    You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU
    have seen before.)

ALADDIN:    Who are you?
OLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,
        perhaps we can be more.
ALADDIN:    I'm listening.
OLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled
        with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
        Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd
        wager.

(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word
    'princess' as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation
     of "PRIN-cess."   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks
    his head out of JAFAR's "old man" disguise.)

IAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here!
ALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry--
OLD MAN:    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy?
        Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins,
        showing a hideously bad mouth.)
ALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful
        treasure with me?
OLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong
        back to go in after it.
ALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?

(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)

OLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they
        seem.  So, do we have a deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)

ABU:        Oh, hmm.

(Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the
    OLD MAN and ABU on it.  Diss. to cave of wonders.)

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
ALADDIN:    It is I, Aladdin.
CAVE:       Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.

(The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of
    ALADDIN. )

OLD MAN:    Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then
        you shall have your reward.
ALADDIN:    C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of
        his vest.)

(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom
    and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)

ALADDIN:    Would ya look at that!
ABU:        Uh oh!
ALADDIN:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer
        than the sultan!

(ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!

(ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)

ALADDIN:    Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.

(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises
    off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling
    they're being followed.)

ABU:        Huh?

(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and
    the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the
     CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU
     runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)

ABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin!
ALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off?

(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet
    jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls
    ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other
     side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches
    down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits
    thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his
     face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles
     ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy?

(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)

ALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna
        hurt you.

(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts
    it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to
     him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.)

ALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite.

(The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes
    his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.")

ALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help
        us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies
        over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You
        see, we're trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET
        motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows
        where it is.

(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant
    underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar,
     with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water
     with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of
    the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN:    Wait here!
ABU:        Oh.  Huh?

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a
    giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the
     stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain
     to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down
        here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free
        of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu-
        NO!

(ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to
    shake.)

CAVE VOICE: Infidels!
ABU:            Uh oh!
CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU
               places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel
                and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you
                will never again see the light of day!

(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he
    skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into
     lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears
    and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the
    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava.
    Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock
     is exploding.)

ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move!

(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling
    debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off
        his head and sees they are flying into a wall.)
        Start panicking.

(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they
    emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to
     growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a
    boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs
    onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top,
    within reach.)

ALADDIN:    Help me out!
OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.
OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp!

(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a
    nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD
     MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN:    What are you doing?
OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his
        normal voice.) Your eternal reward.

(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when
    ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN,
     who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as
     well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a
     boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races
     up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several
    times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one
    final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off
     his disguise.)

JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't
        find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!!

(Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next
    to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)

SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?
JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She
        looks as if she's been crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right.
        Now, tell me everything.

(Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET.
    ABU tries to wake him.)

ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin.

(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.)

ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.)
        We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the
        entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer)
        Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
ABU:        Aha!

(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a
        beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think
        there's something written here, but it's hard to
        make out.

(He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the
    LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the
    LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.)

GENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya
        such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a
        nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins
        it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a
        ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be
        outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as
        a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and
        gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in
        ALADDIN's face.)  What's your name?
ALADDIN:    Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIE:  (Says his name as if he's discovered something
        major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with
        ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The
        sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.)
        Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can
        we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how
        bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog
        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy!
        C'mon, Laddi!'
ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder
        than I thought.
GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog
        poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU
        screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I
        didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen
        you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo!
        Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE.
        GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller
        than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either
        that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the
        side--do I look different to you?
ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?
GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
        mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can
        be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold
        Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a
        cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with
        a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside)
        but never duplicated--

(He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.)

DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,
            duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated,
            duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.
GENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)
        Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed
        Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right
        here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment.
        Thank youuuuu!
ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?
GENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the
        wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot
        machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in
        the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE
        caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres.
        (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No
        substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck
        drops with the secret word "Refunds.'
ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.
GENIE:  (Music for "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't
        think you quite realize what you've got here! So
        why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate
        the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a
        fluorescent light)

    Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
    Scheherazadie had a thousand tales
    But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve
    You got a brand of magic never fails!

(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes
    the thieves into submission.)

    You got some power in your corner now
    Some heavy ammunition in your camp
    You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
    See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
    And I'll say

(Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged
    by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and
    explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's
     hand and rubs lamp with it.)

    Mister Aladdin sir
    What will your pleasure be?
    Let me take your order, jot it down
    You ain't never had a friend like me
    No no no!

(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a
    note pad, like a waiter. )

    Life is your restaurant
    And I'm your maitre' d!
    C'mon whisper what it is you want
    You ain't never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,
    but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes
     into four duplicate GENIEs.)

    Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
    You're the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish
    How about a little more Baklava?

(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure
    and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the
    screen with baklava.)

    Try some of column 'A'
    Try all of column 'B'
    I'm in the mood to help you dude
    You ain't never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top,
    then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off
    and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth,
    and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE
     dressed like a magician comes out.)

(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant
    hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish
    him into nothing.)

    Can your friends do this?
    Do your friends do that?
    Do your friends pull this out their little hat
    Can your friends go poof!
    Well looky here
    Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip
    And then make the sucker disappear?

(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
    He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
    one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses
     the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull
     himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around
     until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into
    a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them,
     they disappear.)

    So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
    I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
    You got me bona fide, certified
    You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs!
    I got a powerful urge to help you out
    So what you wish I really want to know
    You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt
    So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh!


(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a
    certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls
     a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses
    to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.)

    Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
    I'm on the job, you big nabob
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me!
    You ain't never had a friend like me!

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one.
     She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into
    existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels,
     and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold
     as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and
    zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a
    neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and
    sees that is is empty.)

GENIE:  So what'll it be, master?
ALADDIN:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
GENIE:  (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a
        few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos
ALADDIN:    Like?
GENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He
        slices his head off with his finger.)  So don't
        ask.  Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love
        with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of
        lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there.
        (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a
        zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from
        the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs
        ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He
        poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got
        it!
ALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You
        mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all
        powerful genie--can't even bring people back from
        the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even
        get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna
        have to find a way out of here--

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of
    them.)

GENIE:  Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at
        me?  Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did
        you bring me here?  And all of a sudden, you're
        walkin' out on me?  (Gets madder and madder) I
        don't think so, not right now.  You're gettin' your
        wishes, so siddown!  (They all get on CARPET.
        GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of
        arms pointing out the exits.)  In case of
        emergency, the exits are here, here, here,
        here,here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
        here, anywhere!  Keep your hands and arms inside
        the carpet.  Weeee'rrrrrreee...outta here!

(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off
    into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is
    there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.  If it weren't for all
        your years of loyal service... . From now on,
        you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me,
        before they are beheaded.
JAFAR:  I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy
        business behind us.  Please?
JAFAR:  My most abject and humblest apologies to you as
        well, princess.  (He takes her hand to kiss it, but
        she yanks it away.)
JASMINE:    At least some good will come of my being forced to
        marry.  When I am queen, I will have the
        power to get rid of you.
SULTAN: That's nice.  All settled, then.  Now, Jasmine,
        getting back to this suitor business, (he
        looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine?
        Jasmine!  (He runs after her.)
JAFAR:  If only I had gotten that lamp!
IAGO:       (As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of
        you!  D'oh!  To think--we gotta keep kissing
        up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the
        rest of our lives...
JAFAR:  No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband.
        Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded!
BOTH:       Eeewww!
IAGO:       (Has an idea) Oh!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
        Jafar?  What if you were the chump husband?
JAFAR:  (He looks at IAGO in insult)  What?
IAGO:       Okay, you marry the princess,all right? Then, uh,
        you become sultan!
JAFAR:  Oh!Marry the shrew?  I become sultan.  The idea has
        merit!
IAGO:       Yes, merit! Yes!  And then we drop papa-in-law and
        the little woman off a cliff!  (Dive bombs into the
        floor)  Kersplat!
JAFAR:  Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!

(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is
    coming in for a landing.)

GENIE:  (Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic
        Carpet for all your travel needs.  Don't stand
        until the rug has come to a complete stop.  (As
        ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by
        CARPET) Thank you.  Good bye, good bye!  Thank you!
        Good bye!  (Back to normal)  Well, now.  How about
        that, Mr.  doubting mustafa?
ALADDIN:    Oh, you sure showed me.  Now about my three wishes-
GENIE:  Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three? You are down by
        ONE, boy!
ALADDIN:    Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the
        cave.  You did that on your own.

(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a
    sheep.)

GENIE:  Well, don't I feel just sheepish?  All right, you
        baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies.
ALADDIN:    Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be
        good.  (To GENIE) What would you wish for?

(GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE:  Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in
        my case, ah, forget it.
ALADDIN:    What?  No, tell me.
GENIE:  Freedom.
ALADDIN:    You're a prisoner?
GENIE:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig.
        (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic
        powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.)
        Itty bitty living space
ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible.
GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not
        have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do
        you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own
        master, such a thing would be greater than all the
        magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But
        what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real
        here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and
        smell the hummus
ALADDIN:    Why not?
GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master
        wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's
        happened.
ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free.
GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh
        huh, right.  Whoop!
ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in
        and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my
        first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you
        free.   (He holds out his hand)
GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.)
        O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a
        magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want
        most?
ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl--
GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a
        heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't
        make anybody fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and...
GENIE:  Pretty?
ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and
        this hair, wow...and her smile.
GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.)
        Ami.  C'est l'amour.
ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd
        have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince?
GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh,
        chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a
        crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab?
        (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from
        "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I
        hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A
        dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu,
        Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at
        ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the
        words!
ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!
GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square
        shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes
        a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and
        vest combo is much too third century. These
        patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No!
        Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's
        measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is
        outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy
        macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it
        say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse
        me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to
        cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and
        he flies over.)
ABU:        Uh oh!
GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game
        show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with
        "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your
        grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than
        riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out,
        it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it
        opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He
        spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the
        GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his
        fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.)
        Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need?
        (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning
        ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57
        Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's
        a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail
        fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to
        normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!!
        (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns
        into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from
        under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk
        space, check this action out!

(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.
     The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU
     hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, you look good.
GENIE:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but
        we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban,
        kid, cause we're gonna make you a star!

(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks
    begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys.
    (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN
    balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top,
     then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the
    pile collapses.)

JAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with
        your daughter.
IAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  "If the princess
        has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
        then the sultan shall choose for her."
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to
        stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs
        away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker
        back.)  How could I choose someone she hates?
        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a
        cracker in his mouth.)
JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the
        event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess
        must then be wed to...hmm...interesting.
SULTAN: What?  Who?
JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!
SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can
        marry a princess, I'm quite sure.
JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my
        lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the
        SULTAN with it.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell
        breaks momentarily)...but you're so old!
JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry
        me!
SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again
        broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince
        Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha.
        Jafar., you must come and see this!

(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in
    human form as a MAJOR.)

MARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali!
SWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It's Prince Ali!
MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar,
    Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star,
    Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
    Make way, here he comes,
    Ring bells, bang the drums.
    You're gonna love this guy

(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.)

    Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!
    Genuflect, show some respect
    Down on one knee

(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)

    Now try your best to stay calm
    Brush up your Sunday Salaam
    And come and meet his spectacular coterie.

(IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The
    MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand
    on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.)

    Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa!
    Strong as ten regular men, definitely
    He faced the galloping hordes
    A hundred bad guys with swords
    Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali!

(The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt
    zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic
     wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child
    and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)

CHORUS OF MEN:(Carrying the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels!

(In pops a typical parade commentator)

HARRY:  Don't they look lovely, June?

CHORUS OF WOMEN:    (On a float)  Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three!

(In comes another commentator.)

JUNE:   Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers!

GENIE:  (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down
            the parade)
    When it comes to exotic type mammals
    Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you
    It's a world class menagerie!

(GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two
    lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony,
    where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)

    GENIE:
        GIRLS: (in couterpoint)
    Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
        There's no question this Ali's alluring
    That physique, how can I speak
        Never ordinary, never boring
    Weak at the knee
        Everything about the man just plain impresses
    Well, get on out in that square
        He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder
    Adjust your veil and prepare
        He's about to pull my heart asunder
    To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!
        And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

(JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She
    humphs it off, then leaves.)

CHORUS: He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
    (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!)
    And to view them, he charges no fee!
    (He's generous, so generous)
    He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies!
    (Proud to work for him)
    They bow to his whim, love serving him
    They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to
    collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the
    palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door
    to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door.
    Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing
     JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

GENIE:  Prince Ali!
    Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa
    Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!
    And that,good people, is why
    He got dolled up and dropped by
    With sixty elephants, llamas galore
    With his bears and lions
    A brass band and more
    With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
    His birds that warble on key
    Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back
    on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the
     door shut.)

SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous.
ALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have
            journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to
        meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.)
        This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted
        too.
JAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince
        Abooboo--
ALADDIN:    --Ababwa!
JAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited
        and expect to--
SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
        (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his
        moustache.)  I don't suppose I might...
ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me.

(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down.
    JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)

JAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this--
SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who
    was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly
     bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and
    CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack,
     flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the
    background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)

JAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from?
ALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.
        (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.)
JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.)
SULTAN: Look out, Polly!

(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their
    heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)

IAGO:       Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!

(The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and
    crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head
    is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker,
    have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar,
        watch this!  (He lands.)
JAFAR:  Spectacular, your highness.
SULTAN: Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for
        it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then
        collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very
        impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers
        to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry
        Jasmine after all.
JAFAR:  I don't trust him, sire.
SULTAN: Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm
        an excellent judge of character.
IAGO:   Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!!

(JASMINE walks in quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!
ALADDIN:    And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine!
JAFAR:  Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's
        behalf.  (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This
        boy is no different than the others.  What makes
        him think he is worthy of the princess?
ALADDIN:    Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks
        JAFAR's goatee, which springs out in all
        directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win
        your daughter!
JASMINE:    How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.)
        All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I
        am not a prize to be won!  (She storms out.)
SULTAN: Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give
        Jasmine time to cool down.  (They exit.)
JAFAR:  I think it's time to say good bye to Prince
        Abooboo.

(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find
    ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN:    What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me
        talk to her.  I should have known I couldn't pull
        off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with
        his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes
        it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then
        tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the
        same.)
GENIE:  (to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does,
        knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey.
        That's a good move.  (As Rodney Dangerfield) I
        can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug.
ALADDIN:    Genie, I need help.
GENIE:  (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here's the
        deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta
        be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?
ALADDIN:    What?
GENIE:  (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points
        out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her
        the...TRUTH!!!
ALADDIN:    No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some
        crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. (He
        puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)
GENIE:  A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!
        (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light.
        GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all
        joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself.
ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay,
        I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool,
        confident.  How do I look?
GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed,
    sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.)

ALADDIN:    (From a distance) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and growls.)

JASMINE:    Who's there?
ALADDIN:    It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his
        deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE:    I do not want to see you.
ALADDIN:    No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH
        growls and advances on him.)
JAFAR:  Just leave me alone.
ALADDIN:    Down kitty!

(Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.)

GENIE:  How's our beau doing?

(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)

ALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off
        his turban to brush RAJAH away.)
JASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him
        before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you?
ALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.
JASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.
ALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.)
        I have servants that go to the marketplace for me.
        Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace
        for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you
        met.
JASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not.
BEE:        (It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk
        about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes.
        Anything--pick a feature!
ALADDIN:    Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very...
BEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!
ALADDIN:    Punctual!
JASMINE:    Punctual?
BEE:        Sorry.
ALADDIN:    Beautiful.
BEE:        Nice recovery.
JASMINE:    Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know.
ALADDIN:    Yeah!
JASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan
ALADDIN:    I know.
JASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry.
ALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me.
BEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!
JASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt,
             swaggering, peacock I've met!
BEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday!
              Mayday!
JASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)
ALADDIN:    What?
BEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
ALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off!
BEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into
             his turban)
ALADDIN:    Yeah, right!
JASMINE:    What!?!
ALADDIN:    Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be
        won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free
        to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look
        at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He
        steps up on the ledge and drops off.)
JASMINE:    No!
ALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What?
JASMINE:    (Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that?
        (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)
ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet.
JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a
        tassel.)
ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you?
        We could get out of the palace, see the world.
JASMINE:    Is it safe?
ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me?
JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all-
        important line) What?
ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust
        me?
JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes.

(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky,
    knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole
     New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking
    up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace
     wall and into the sky.)

ALADDIN:    I can show you the world
    Shining, shimmering, splendid.
    Tell me princess, now when did you last
    Let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a
    flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
      She smiles.)

    I can open your eyes
    Take you wonder by wonder
    Over, sideways, and under
    On a magic carpet ride


(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.)

    A whole new world!
    A new fantastic point of view
    No one to tell us no
    Or where to go
    Or say we're only dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET
    flies in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE:    A whole new world
    A dazzling place I never knew
    But when I'm way up here
    It's crystal clear
    That now I'm in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN:    Now I'm in a whole new world with you!

(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It
    then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)

JASMINE:    Unbelievable sights
    Indescribable feeling
    Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
    Through an endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified
    and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting
    ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then
    zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)

JASMINE:    A whole new world!
ALADDIN:    Don't you dare close your eyes
JASMINE:    An hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN:    Hold your breath--it gets better!
JASMINE:    I'm like a shooting star,
    I've come so far
    I can't go back to where I used to be!

(They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the
     ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker
     sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but
    chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)

ALADDIN:    A whole new world!
JASMINE:    Every turn a surprise
ALADDIN:    With new horizons to pursue
JASMINE:    Every moment, red-letter

(They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.)

BOTH:   I'll chase them anywhere
    There's time to spare
    Let me share this whole new world with you

    A whole new world
    That's where we'll be

(They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a
    tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure
    she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)

ALADDIN:    A thrilling chase
JASMINE:    A wondrous place
BOTH:       For you and me!

(CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of
    the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple
    at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)

JASMINE:    It's all so magical.
ALADDIN:    Yeah.
JASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
        It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
ALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up
        realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really
        like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)
        That is...oh no!
JASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the
        market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry.
JASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid?
ALADDIN:    No!
JASMINE:    That I wouldn't figure it out?
ALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not
        what I meant.
JASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth!
ALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on,
        giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I
        sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the
        pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in
        defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on
         his turban falls down over his eyes.)
JASMINE:    Why didn't you just tell me?
ALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the
        city in disguise, it sounds a little strange,
        don't you think?
JASMINE:    Not that strange.

(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a
    tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext.
    of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET
    forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends
     just below the balcony.)

JASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince.
ALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they
    kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and
    looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends
        to the ground.) For the first time in my life,
        things are starting to go right.

(He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth.
        Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant
        hanging from a net tied in a tree.)
GUARD:  Hold him!

(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties
    CARPET in a knot around a tree.)

JAFAR:  I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince
        Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he's
        never found.

(A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a
    cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water.
      He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock
     hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles
    out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he
    loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled
    by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes,
    and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)

GENIE:  Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at
        the lamp.  (Squeaks the duck)  Hello.  (Sees
        unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it!
        You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you
        unless you make a wish.  You have to say  "Genie I
        want you to save my life."  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon
        Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and
        shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I'll
        take that as a yes.  (Head turns into a siren.)
        Wooga!  Wooga!  (Turns into a submarine.)  Up
        scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like
        German.  On the surface, a giant water spout
        emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN
        reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.)
        Don't you scare me like that!
ALADDIN:    Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say
        it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie.
GENIE:  Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not
        that I want to pick out curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing
   her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.)

SULTAN: Jasmine!
JASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time.
        I'm so happy.
SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be,
        Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.
JASMINE:    What?
SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will
        wed Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.)

JAFAR:  You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a
        wife.
JASMINE:    I will never marry you.  (She goes to the SULTAN)
        Father, I choose Prince Ali!
JAFAR:  Prince Ali left!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.)

ALADDIN:    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar!
JASMINE:    Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)

IAGO:       How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!
ALADDIN:    Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me
        killed.
JAFAR:  What?  (He goes to the SULTAN)  Ridiculous
        nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying.
        (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.)
SULTAN: Obviously...lying.

(ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.)

JASMINE:    Father, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN:    I know!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches
    and the spell is broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my!
ALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with
        this!  (He advances the staff)
SULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained.
SULTAN: Guards! Guards!
IAGO:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just
        dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but
    is grabbed by guards.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.
JAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy!

(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes
    him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud
    appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find him, search everywhere!
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right?
JASMINE:    Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against
        me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever-
        (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.)
        Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a
        suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You
        brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll
        leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once!
        Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and
        then my boy, you will be sultan!
ALADDIN:    Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a
        person of your unimpeachable moral character is
        exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks
        concerned at this.)

(Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta
        start packing, your highness.  Only essentials.
        (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.
        JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the
        guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out
        a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about
        this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a
        weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.)
        Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO
        flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar?
        Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around
        the neck) Good grip!
JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin
        Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago.
IAGO:       Why that miserable--
JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it!
IAGO:       Me?

(Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.)

ALADDIN:    Sultan?  They want me to be sultan?

(GENIE comes out of lamp)

GENIE:  Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero!  (Turns into a
        one-man band.  He sees ALADDIN walk away with his
        head hung.  He stops, scratches his head, comes up
        with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN.  He holds
        up his hands like a director scoping a picture and
        we look through them.)  Aladdin, you've just won
        the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do
        next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in
        sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs.
        GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls
        out a script labeled "Aladdin." Whispering: )
        Psst, your line is "I'm going to free the genie."
        Anytime.
ALADDIN:    Genie...I can't.
GENIE:  Sure you can.  You just go "Genie, I wish you
        free."  (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses
        him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.)
ALADDIN:    I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But
        they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make
        Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
GENIE:  Al, you won!
ALADDIN:    Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I'm
        anything is because of you.  What if they find out
        I'm not really a prince?  (Quietly)  What if
        Jasmine finds out?  I'll lose her.  Genie, I can't
        keep this up on my own.  I can't wish you free.
GENIE:  (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand.  After all,
        you've lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning
        to feel left out.  Now, if you'll excuse me,
        master. (He says the last word in disgust, then
        poofs back into the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.)

ABU:        Ohhh.
ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the
        spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams
        a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in
        there!  (He looks at ABU and CARPET.)  What are you
        guys looking at? (They both leave.) Look, I--I'm
        sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I didn't--
        wait, c'mon.  (He sighs.)  What am I doing?
        Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?
ALADDIN:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes.  (He walks
        into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you?

(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
    in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO:       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry.
ALADDIN:    I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs,
    then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is
    panting.)

FLAMINGO:   D'uh!
IAGO:       Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird's
        feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace
        and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar's
        gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face
        like JAFAR's and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago!
        (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale
        of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah,
        Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm
        blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making
    an announcement to the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a
        suitor!

(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN
    appears at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine?
JASMINE:    Ali, where have you been?
ALADDIN:    There's something I've got to tell you.
JASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's
        announcement!
ALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!
JASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform
        with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire
        crowd.)
SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa!
ALADDIN:    Oh, boy!

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.)

IAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
JAFAR:  Let them cheer.

 (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.)

GENIE:  You know Al, I'm getting (turns and sees JAFAR)
        reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He
        descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the
        role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and
        sinister ugly man.
JAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the
        ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.)
GENIE:  I was afraid of that.
JAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on
        high, as sultan!!!

(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes.
    The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)

ALADDIN:    Whoa!
SULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on?

(His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body
    flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer
     shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)

JAFAR:  Heh heh heh!
SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer.
IAGO:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
ALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls
        off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp!
JAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into
    the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him.
      They fly up near the GENIE's head.)

ALADDIN:    Genie!  No!
GENIE:  Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the
        palace on top of a mountain.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!
JAFAR:  There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you
        will bow to me!

(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR:  We'll never bow to you!
IAGO:       Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will
        cower before a sorcerer!  (To GENIE)  Genie, my
        second wish--I wish to be the most powerful
        sorcerer in the world!

(GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot,
    and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR,
     returning him to his normal look.)

IAGO:       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for
        Sorcerer Jafar!
JAFAR:  Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation!
        (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and
        they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him.
        He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty-
        cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin
        with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to
        introduce you to.
ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her!

(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.)

JAFAR:  Prince Ali
    Yes, it is he,
    But not as you know him.
    Read my lips and come to grips
    With reality

(JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.)

    Yes, meet a blast from your past
    Whose lies were too good to last
    Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO:       Or should we say Aladdin?
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
    Just a con, need I go on?
    Take it from me
    His personality flaws
    Give me adequate cause
    To send him packing on a one-way trip
    So his prospects take a terminal dip
    His assets frozen, the venue chosen
    Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
    So long,
IAGO:       Good bye, see ya!
JAFAR:  Ex-Prince Ali!

(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into
    a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before
    CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where
    the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop.
    ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)

ALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of
        snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have
        freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs
        out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu!
        Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of
        everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set
        things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow,
        and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.)
        Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by
        the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He
        can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the
        base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's
        it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and
        the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away,
        looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar
        rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and
        ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by
        the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He
        looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU.
        CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick
        them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go!

(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds.
    Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN
    tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the
    throne.)

IAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker.
        Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have
        lots!

(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.)

JAFAR:  Leave him alone!

(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)

JAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
        (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.)
        A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be
        on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
        (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do
        you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen...

(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE:    Never!
JAFAR:  I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he
        raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No.
        Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I
        wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in
        love with me.

(We see ALADDIN race back into town.)

GENIE:  (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few
        addendas, some quid pro quo-
JAFAR:  Don't talk back to me, you stupid blue lout!  You
        will do what I order you to do, slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to
    play along.)

JASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.)
        Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly
        handsome you are.

(The GENIE's jaw drops.)

JAFAR:  That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a
        shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more
        about...myself.
JASMINE:    You're tall, well dressed...

(JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE
    sees them.)

GENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy!
ALADDIN:    Shh!
GENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.)
        Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath,
        now.  (His head turns into JAFAR's, then back.)
ALADDIN:    Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's
        mouth.)  I'll improvise.

(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE.
    JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.)

JAFAR:  Go on.
JASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her
        arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her
        finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN
        to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.)

IAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)
JAFAR:  And the street rat?
JASMINE:    What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR
    turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN
     looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)

ABU:        Yuck!
JAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her
        crown.) You!!  How many times do I have
        to kill you, boy?

 (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the
    ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)

ALADDIN:    Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then
    zaps her into an hourglass.)

JAFAR:  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!

(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine!
IAGO:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes for the lamp.)

JAFAR:  Don't toy with me!  (He's zapped into a toy monkey.
ALADDIN:    Abu!


(CARPET rushes in.)

JAFAR:  Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is
        zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the
        lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by
        large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs
        the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a
        sword out of the floor.) I'm just getting warmed
        up!  (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN:    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly
        snake?
JAFAR:  A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how
        snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we
        see a snake's tongue come out from behind his
        teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the
        ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the
        snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes
        moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN
        swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE
        cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.)

GENIE:  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into
        that snake!
JAFAR:  You stay out of thissss!

(GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a 'J' on it.)

GENIE:  (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it,
        GREAT!

(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where
    JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path.
     ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)

JASMINE:    Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing
    the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake
    cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and
    hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back
     and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to
     free the princess.)

ALADDIN:    Hang on, Jasmine!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.)

JAFAR:  (laughs hideously)  You little fool!  You thought
        you could defeat the most powerful being on earth!
IAGO:       (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him,
        Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him
        out of the way)
JAFAR:  Without the genie, boy, you're nothing!
ALADDIN:    (Has an idea)  The genie!  The genie!  The genie
        has more power than you'll ever have!
JAFAR:  What!!
ALADDIN:    He gave you your power, he can take it away!
GENIE:  Al, what are you doing?  Why are you bringing me
        into this?
ALADDIN:    Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best!
JAFAR:  You're right!  His power does exceed my own!  But
        not for long!

(JAFAR circles around the GENIE.)

GENIE:  The boy is crazy.  He's a little punch drunk.  One
        too many hits with the snake  (His hand
        turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)
JAFAR:  Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be an all
        powerful genie!
GENIE:  (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command.
        Way to go, Al.

(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt.
    JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We
     see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN
    runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess
     pour out.)

JAFAR:  Yes!  Yes!  The power! The absolute power!
JASMINE:    (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN:    Trust me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.)

JAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control!
ALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something?
    (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you
    got it!  And everything that goes with it!

(Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.)

JAFAR:  No!  No!
IAGO:       I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the
        genie, I don't want--

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.)

ALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space.
GENIE:  Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN
    and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of
     the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed
     because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears
     where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the
    new lamp.)

JAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak
        out of my face!
IAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron!
JAFAR:  Don't tell me to shut up!
GENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the
        balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He
        winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his
        palm flat and flicks it out into the desert
        with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of
        wonders ought to chill him out!

(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks
    over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a
        prince.
JASMINE:    I know why you did.
ALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes
        his head around the corner shocked at what he is
        hearing.)
JASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you.
GENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You've still
        got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a
        prince again.
ALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is
        love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you're
        not gonna find another girl like her in a million
        years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked.
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop
        pretending to be something I'm not.
JASMINE:    I understand.

(They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns
    to the GENIE.)

ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for your freedom.
GENIE:  One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.  I--what?
ALADDIN:    (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.)  Genie, you're
        free!

(A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off
    GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground.
     GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

GENIE:  (He can't believe it.)  Heh, heh!  I'm free. I'm
        free.  (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.)  Quick,
        quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  "I want
        the Nile."   Wish for the Nile.  Try that!
ALADDIN:    I wish for the Nile.
GENIE:  No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around
        the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel
        good!  I'm free!  I'm free at last!  I'm hittin'
        the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I--

(He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking
    very sad.)

ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you.
GENIE:  Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll
        always be a prince to me.

(They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.)

SULTAN: That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth
        as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the
        problem.
JASMINE:    Father?
SULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day
        forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems
        worthy.
JASMINE:    (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.)
        Him!  I choose...I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN:    Ha, ha.  Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together.
    GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy
     hat.)

GENIE:  Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug!
        Mind if I kiss the monkey?  (He kisses ABU.)  Ooh,
        hairball!  Well, I can't do any more damage around
        this popsicle stand.  I'm outta here!  Bye, bye,
        you two crazy lovebirds.  Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm
        history!   No, I'm mythology!  No, I don't care
        what I am--I'm free!

(The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles
    behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse)
     to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see
     ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.)

ALADDIN:    A whole new world
JASMINE:        A whole new life
BOTH:   (with off-camera chorus)    For you and me!
MEN'S CHORUS:   A whole new world!

(They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared,
    the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly
    the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up
     and looks at the audience.)

GENIE:  Made ya look!

(Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black.
    The end.)

                         Z (O.S.)
                      (over a dark screen)
               All my life, I've lived and worked in
               the big city...

     We see:

     EXT. AN ANT MOUND - DAY

     The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside,
     past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the
     gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access
     tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants
     plodding along...

     ...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming
     vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants
     rushing here and there on their business.  We see -- a
     "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like
     crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants
     marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down
     a matchbox elevator filled with workers.

                         Z (V.O.)
               ...which is kind of a problem, since
               I've always felt uncomfortably in
               crowds.

     INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     We join Z, a worker ant with issues.  He's lying on a couch,
     recounting his woes.

                         Z
               I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've
               got abandonment issues.  My father
               flew away when I was just a larva.
               My mother didn't have much time for
               me...when you have five million
               siblings, it's difficult to get
               attention.
                      (pause)
               I feel physically inadequate -- I've
               never been able to lift more than ten
               times my own weight.  Sometimes I
               think I'm just not cut out to be a
               worker.  But I don't have any other
               options.  I was assigned to trade
               school when I was just a grub.  The
               whole system just...makes me
               feel...insignificant.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (enthusiastic)
               Terrific!  You should feel
               insignificant!

     For the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR.
     He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the
     hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of "Ronco").

                         Z
               ...I should?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (hopping around
                       enthusiastically)
               YES!!!  You know, people ask me,
               "Doctor, why are you always happy?"
               And I tell them it's mind over
               matter.  I don't mind that I don't
               matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get
               it?

     Z gives a fake smile.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (incredibly "up")
               Z, we're part of the fastest growing
               species in the whole world!

     The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall.  An arrow
     shows ant population going up, up, up.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Ask me why we're so successful.

                         Z
               Why are we so successful?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               I'm glad you asked me that question!

     The motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a
     vista of the ant-filled chamber below.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               What do you see out there?

                         Z
               ...Ants...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures,
               each with his assigned task, all
               pulling together!

     Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an
     incline.  One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down,
     crushing his leg.  The other ants rush over -- it looks like
     they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they
     climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing
     with their task.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               You see?  Being an ant is being able
               to say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless,
               you're meaningless."

                         Z
               But -- but I've always felt life was
               about finding meaning...and then
               sharing it with someone special,
               someone you love.

     The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he
     seems to understand...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Z...you need help.
                      (looking at a clock)
               Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop
               there.  Your minute is up!

     The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Now back to work!  We've made real
               progress!  Remember -- let's be
               best superorganism we can be!

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel".
     A banner strung overhead reads: "The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling
     Our Way to a Bright Future!"  Along the walls hang 50's work-
     incentive style posters with messages like, "You asked for
     it, you got it -- more work!" and "TWO MEALS A WEEK IS
     ENOUGH!!!"  Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel,
     digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone
     synchronized.

     CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand.
     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands
     there, waiting to pass the dirt on.  Z is daydreaming behind
     her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.

                         AZTECA
               Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap
               out of it, or there's gonna be a lot
               of pissed off ants!

     Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.

                         Z
                      (snapping out of it)
               Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas!
               Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!
                      (looking at the dirt)
               Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I
               mean this dirt is very...dirty.
               Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?
                      (Z's stomach growls)
               Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm
               seeing double.  It looks like there's
               two million ants in here.  When's
               lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?

                         AZTECA
                      (sweetly)
               Z, old pal...
                      (shouts)
               SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's
               a food shortage without you
               complaining about it every day.

                         Z
               The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

                         AZTECA
               No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets thrown
               away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z,
               even though you are a pain in my rear-
               segment.  I don't wanna see
               anything happen to you.  So quit
               mouthing off, before you get in
               trouble.

     A WHISTLE BLOWS.

                         Z
               Thank goodness.  Breaktime.

     All the ants put down their tools.  A beat.  Then the WHISTLE
     BLOWS AGAIN.  All the ants pick up their tools again.

                         AZTECA
                      (resigned)
               Break's over.

                         Z
                      (getting back to work)
               This colony needs another tunnel like
               a hole in the ground.  Why are we
               even digging this thing?

                         AZTECA
               Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we
               gotta dig.  We're not the ones in
               charge.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony.  Looming over
     the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be
     inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.

     Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters,
     seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants
     in the place?

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               STAIRS!

     The workers look up and GROAN.  Then they start forming a
     stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on
     each other's shoulders.  It's extremely unpleasant work.  One
     ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place
     before...

     GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the
     colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he
     ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow.  As
     Formica mounts the "stairs"  we can hear the workers going,
     "OUCH!  OOF!  YIKES!" etc.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               Cut the chit-chat down there!
                      (turning to Carpenter)
               We've spoiled these workers,
               Carpenter.  They've never had it so
               good, and listen to them -- always
               grumbling and complaining...

     Formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who
     muffles a yelp.

                         CARPENTER
               ...Yes, sir.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               What have they got to complain about?
               Three square meals a day...

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we've cut them down to
               three roughly rectangular meals a
               week.

                         FORMICA
               Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.
               I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!

     Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase.
     There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive
     throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge
     SQUEAKS.

                         FORMICA
                      (to guard ant, while
                       passing)
               Oil that, soldier.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     The QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind
     her.

                         QUEEN
               Ah!  General Formica.

     Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.

     Note:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth
     repeatedly.  Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a
     short "Happy Birthday" fanfare on his trumpet.  Mid-wife ants
     bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few
     words.  The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-
     line, powered by ants on a treadmill.

                         QUEEN
               General, the severe food shortage
               that faces the colony...pains me.
               The thought of any of my children
               going hungry...
                      (she shudders; then,
                       to baby)
               Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You
               are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to
               brush your teeth!
                      (to mid-wife)
               Ship 'er out.
                      (back to Formica)
               What steps are you taking to remedy
               the situation?

                         FORMICA
               We are launching a major offensive to
               expand our foraging territory...

                         QUEEN
               Yes, what else?

                         FORMICA
               Please don't worry, your majesty.
               Leave the worrying to me.  As you
               know, I'm not an ant of half-
               measures.  I don't pussyfoot around.
               This crisis is my number one
               priority, and I promise you it's
               being dealt with swiftly, and
               decisively.

     The Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being
     put in her arms.

                         QUEEN
                      (to baby)
               No snacking between meals!  Off you
               go!
                      (to Formica)
               Now -- what were we saying?

                         FORMICA
                      (Oliver North-style)
               I do not recollect, your majesty.
               Will that be all?

                         QUEEN
               Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my
               good man!  I don't know what we would
               do without you.

     Formica clicks his heels and bows his head.  Carpenter bows
     low.  Formica smartly about faces --

                         BALA (O.S.)
               General Formica!

     PRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway, carrying a
     swatch book.  Something about her sets her apart from the
     HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her.  Her tiara, probably.

     Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him.

                         CARPENTER
                      (sotto)
               Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.

                         FORMICA
               Princess!  You look -- outstanding.
               Is there anything I can do for you?

                         BALA
               Well -- I thought -- since we're
               getting married...it might be nice if
               we...got to know one another.

     Formica looks confused.

                         QUEEN
               Bala has always been a hopeless
               romantic, General.

                         BALA
               It's just that -- well, I'm honored
               that you selected me, and everything,
               I just thought the marriage might go
               a little more smoothly if -- we had
               a conversation?

                         FORMICA
                      (uncomfortable)
               Conversation...yes...well...
                      (to Carpenter)
               Wasn't she briefed?

                         QUEEN
                      (holding up a baby)
               Look, General!  A darling baby
               soldier!
                      (emotionally, to baby)
               Don't try to be a hero!  Just make
               sure you come back in one piece!
                      (handing it off)
               Next!

                         FORMICA
                      (using the
                       interruption)
               I'll take your suggestion under
               advisement, Princess.  In the
               meanwhile --

     Formica turns to go.

                         BALA
               General -- we have to talk sometime!

                         FORMICA
               Very well.  Carpenter, is there a
               convenient time to talk vis-a-vis:
               relationship?

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we're ahead of
               schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds
               available right now.

                         FORMICA
               Outstanding.  Princess...?

     Bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.

                         BALA
               So, um...how was your day?  What did
               you do?

                         FORMICA
                      (scouring his mind)
               Well...
                      (that's it!)
               I declared war!

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing
               in common...

                         CARPENTER
                      (under his breath)
               Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Duty calls!

     He strides across the floor.  Bala watches him go, her
     antennae drooping unhappily.

                         FORMICA
               No squeak.  Outstanding!

     We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as
     Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame.

     The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy.

                         QUEEN
                      (sympathetically)
               I felt the same way before I got
               married.  Confused.  Scared.

                         BALA
                      (hopefully)
               You did?

                         QUEEN
               Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted
               out all those messy feelings.  The
               wonderful thing about ant life is
               that everything is arranged.  Even
               marriage.  You're lucky -- General
               Formica is a paragon of anthood.

                         BALA
                      (unconvinced)
               Yes...he's wonderful...

     The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants
     who were CRUSHED in the wake of Formica's exit.

     INT. BALA'S QUARTERS - DAY

     Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state
     of giggling infatuation over Formica.  Bala is scowling as
     she leafs through a wedding catalogue.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
                      (swooning over
                       General Formica)
               The General's body segments are
               so...symmetrical.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (giggling)
               I'd let him order me into battle
               anyday.

     Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess?  What's wrong?

                         BALA
               Wrong?  How could anything be wrong?
               I'm going to marry General Formica
               and be a queen and have millions of
               babies, just like my mom.
                      (concerned)
               Do I look fat to you?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (knowingly, to
                       Handmaiden #2)
               Pre-wedding jitters.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               You just need to blow off some steam.
               Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!

                         BALA
               The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try
               someplace different.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               There isn't anyplace else --
                      (making a joke)
               Except the worker bar.

                         BALA
               The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where
               I want to go!

     The handmaidens look shocked.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But -- we can't -- there'll be
               workers there.

     INT. ANT BAR - NIGHT

     A long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch
     for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a
     drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at
     the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.

                         Z
               We declared war again?
                      (off Weaver's nod)
               Are you scared?

                         WEAVER
                      (shrugs)
               I'll be back.

     The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like
     a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids,
     little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs
     hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with
     hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.

                         APHIDS
                      (as they're slapped
                       on bar)
               Ouch!  Ouch!

                         BARTENDER
               Two aphid beers.

                         Z
                      (as Bartender leaves)
               Did you see that?  How he gave you
               the beers, not me?  I'm telling you,
               he's got something against workers.

                         WEAVER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about, Z.

                         Z
               Come on -- everybody dumps on us
               workers.  You soldiers get all the
               glory.  Plus you get to go out into
               the world, meet interesting insects,
               and kill them.

                         WEAVER
               Yeah, but you get to spend all day
               with those fabulous worker babes.

     We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "Worker
     Babes", including Z's friend Azteca.

                         Z
               Weaver, they're career girls.
               They're obsessed with digging.
                      (sighs)
               No, I'll probably never meet the girl
               for me.

                         WEAVER
               Who said there was a girl for you?
               I was talking about a girl for me.
                      (quaffing his aphid
                       beer)
               Don't you want your aphid beer?

                         Z
               I can't help it.  I have a thing
               about drinking from the anus of
               another creature.  Call me crazy.

                         WEAVER
               Z, we've known each other a long
               time, right?

                         Z
               Of course.  You were born two seconds
               after me.

                         WEAVER
               And all the time I've known you,
               you've been grumping and groaning.
               You should quit making waves.  Go
               with the flow.

                         Z
               Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.

     Down the bar, there's a commotion.  A grizzled old SCOUT ant
     has had too much to drink.

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               Have you been to Insectopia?  Have
               you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I
               have...
                      (becoming emotional)
               ...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n'
               beetles -- all livin' in peace,
               stuffin their guts with food...No
               rules, no regulations...you can be
               your own ant there...
                      (howling drunkenly)
               It's Insectopia!  Insectopia!

                         Z
               Hey, Weaver, listen!

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               I was cut off from my unit -- found
               it by mistake --
                      (slurring)
               It changed my life!
                      (spraying another
                       soldier with saliva)
               You see -- ya follow the great yellow
               egg, and you come to the land of red
               and white --

                         SOLDIERS
               You've had enough for one night!
               Come on, Gramps, before you get in
               trouble.

     The soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Hey, did you hear what he said?!

                         WEAVER
               Poor guy's had one too many scouting
               missions.

     MUSIC STARTS UP.

     INT. ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar,
     accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               We shouldn't be doing this -- it
               isn't proper!

                         BALA
               I'm the Princess, aren't I?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course --

                         BALA
               And do Princesses do improper things?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course not --

                         BALA
               Then if I go to the worker bar, it
               isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry.
               No one will recognize us in our
               disguises.

     She adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.-
     style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf.

                         BALA
               I'm just a common worker, cooling off
               after a rough day!

     Music starts.  An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the
     dance floor.

                         BARKER
                      (on loudspeaker)
               Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and
               that means it's time to dance.

     Every ant gets up to dance.  Weaver turns to Z.

                         WEAVER
                      (draining his beer)
               Time to cut a rug, Z!

                         Z
               I'm not in the mood.
                      (disgusted)
               Even when they're off work, they
               follow orders.

                         WEAVER
               Well, you just sit here and be a
               party-pooper.

     Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the
     dance.  The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone --
     all the ants already know the steps.  Everyone dances in
     perfect synch.

                         BARKER
                      (southern twang)
               And a left-right-quarterstep-back
               step-halfstep -- a left-right-
               quarterstep-backstep-halfstep --
               a left-right-quarterstep-backstep
               halfstep --

     AT THE ENTRANCE, Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.

                         BALA
               I'm going to ask one of these
               mindless, primitive worker-types to
               dance with me!

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But General Formica would be furious!

                         BALA
                      (enjoying the idea)
               I know.

     The handmaidens are appalled.  Bala whirls away from them,
     sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on --

     Z, who's watching the other ants dance.

                         Z
               What a bunch of losers.  Mindless
               zombies capitulating to an oppressive
               system --

                         BALA
               Wanna dance?

     Bala's standing right there.  Z is instantly smitten.

                         Z
               Me?!  Yes!!!  I mean --
                      (regaining suavosity)
               Just let me finish my beer.

     Not breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely.
     Reaches suavely for a beer.  Suavely grabs the candle in a
     glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face.

     He plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit
     apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her.

                         Z
               So uh -- how come I haven't seen you
               around here before?

                         BALA
                      (covering up)
               I work in the palace, I don't get out
               much.

                         Z
               The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals
               really live it up.  Of course they're
               all a little, you know, from
               inbreeding --

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               What?

     Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the
     ants, but Z can't do any of the steps.

                         Z
               Now, let's see, I -- it's been a
               while since I -- I think you --

     Bala watches Z, trying to follow along.  It's the blind
     leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's
     rapid instructions.

                         Z
               Here, I'll lead.

     Z starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave
     expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter
     mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.

                         BALA
               Are you sure this is a real dance?

                         Z
               Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of
               making it up --

                         BALA
                      (surprised)
               Really?

                         Z
               Why should everyone dance the same
               way?  It's as exciting as watching
               fungus grow.

                         BALA
               You're right!

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You -- you think I'm right?

                         BALA
               Why can't I just do whatever I want
               to do?  Why can't I just go wild?!
               Yahoo!

     Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply
     to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of
     them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too
     wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their
     intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost
     knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's
     back at the moment.

                         SOLDIER
               Hey!  Watch your step, worker.

     Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE,
     glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got
     one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed
     off.

                         BALA
               You watch yours, soldier, or my
               worker friend will beat you up!

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off
               this time.
                      (whispering to Bala)
               Are you crazy?  This guy's built like
               a pebble!
                      (ineptly trying to
                       placate the soldier)
               You know they do great prosthetic
               antennas nowadays --

                         BALA
               Aren't you gonna stand up for
               yourself?

     Z's caught between a rock and a hard place.  He doesn't want
     to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to
     lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered
     around, looking hostile.

                         SOLDIER
               How come you don't dance like the
               rest of us?

     Z glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he
     says defiantly...

                         Z
               Because -- because I'm an individual!

                         SOLDIER #2
               An individual?  Never heard of it.

                         MANDIBLE
               You look like a worker to me.

                         WEAVER
               Hey, lay off my little buddy!

     Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just
     realized something very important.  Unfortunately, just at
     this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him
     back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it,
     there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the
     middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the
     face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess'
     handmaidens hurries over.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess Bala!  Princess Bala!

     Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.

                         Z
               Princess?  You're a Princess?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               The police are coming!

                         BALA
               Uh oh.
                      (to Z)
               Goodbye!  Gotta run!

                         Z
               Wait!  When can I see you again?

                         BALA
               Let me think.  Hmmnn...
                      (thinks)
               Never.  Bye!

     Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of
     whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait!  Princess!  Wait!

     But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY

     Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.
     Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.

                         WEAVER
               Get real, Z!  She just dropped the
               scarf by accident!

                         Z
               Are you kidding?  There were sparks
               between us!  This scarf is a sign!

                         WEAVER
               It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do
               you know what the penalty for
               impersonating a soldier is?

                         Z
               What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your
               place for the royal inspection.  Bala
               comes strolling down the line, she
               sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled,
               and she takes me up to the palace for
               a little...
                      (wags his eyebrows
                       suggestively)
               tea and crumpets... and you take your
               place again, and go march around to
               your heart's content!

     Weaver looks unconvinced.

                         Z
               You have to help me.  Please, Weaver.
               Think of all the things I've done for
               you!

                         WEAVER
                      (thinks)
               I can't think of any.

                         Z
                      (pause)
               Well I'm gonna start doing things for
               you...

                         WEAVER
               Will you introduce me to some worker
               girls?

                         Z
               You bet!  They'll really go for a
               sensitive guy like you!

                         WEAVER
               Maybe I'll get lucky.
                      (Weaver thinks about
                       it)
               You know, Z, I wouldn't do this
               for anyone but you...

     Weaver hands Z has helmet.

                         WEAVER
               Wear this.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               You're a real buddy.

                         WEAVER
                      (sourly)
               Yeah, I know.

                         Z
               What do I do?

                         WEAVER
               Don't tell anyone you're a worker.
               Follow that column over there.  And
               come right back after the inspection!

     Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               Thanks!  I owe you!

     Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the
     soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT

     The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a
     reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of
     soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant
     General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads,
     "GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey".

     Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.

                         Z
               Any of you guys know when the
               Princess will show up?  She's kind of
               a personal friend.

     The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.

                         LOUD VOICE
               ATTEN-SHUN!

     MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as
     they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.

     GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping
     his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some
     unfortunate insect)

                         FORMICA
               First of all, let me make one thing
               clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by
               thinking for himself.  All this
               "thinking" stuff is a load of crap.
               If the almighty had wanted you boys
               to think, he wouldn't have given you
               huge mandibles and a brain so small
               you'd misplace it if it wasn't
               trapped inside your head.

     In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's
     just made a joke.

                         Z
                      (slapping his thigh)
               "Trapped inside your head" -- that's
               a good one --

     Z notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops.

                         Z
               Geez -- tough room.

     From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying
     to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many
     ants.  He continues.

                         FORMICA
                      (striding back and
                       forth)
               We ants survive as a species because
               we do what we're told.  We survive
               because we work together, as one, we
               get the job done, we do whatever it
               takes to persevere!
                      (dramatic pause)
               Hell, we're not an army of
               ants...we're one giant ant, with
               giant fists, and giant jaws!

     The soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.

                         Z
                      (to the soldier ant
                       next to him)
               Lays it on a little thick, doesn't
               he?  If you ask me, he's one giant
               bore.

                         FORMICA
               Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt
               about a food shortage.  Well you boys
               are gonna be taken care of.  But in
               the meantime we're gonna eat the
               enemy for breakfast, we are gonna
               eat the enemy for lunch, and we are
               gonna eat the enemy for dinner!

                         Z
               Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.

                         FORMICA
                      (reflective moment)
               Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.
                      (he looks out at his
                       army)
               And I know each and every one of you
               boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.

     Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in
     confusion.

                         Z
                      (clapping)
               Bravo!  Bring on the Princess!

                         COLONEL
               Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's
               move 'em out!

     The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past
     the reviewing stand.

     A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around
     for the Princess.

                         COLONEL
               Eyes...left!

     Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the
     reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next
     to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.

                         Z
                      (waving)
               Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's
               me!  Z!  I've got your scarf!

     ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she
     sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching
     by...

                         BALA
                      (peering out)
               Who is that idiot?

                         QUEEN
               Darling, you must encourage the
               troops -- wave!

     Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her
     hand back and forth on her wrist.

     Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Excuse me, guys -- That's my date.
               Well, it's been fun.  Have a great
               war!

     Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's
     surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're
     carrying him along with them.

                         Z
               Hey!  Wait!

     Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away.
     BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps Z on the
     shoulder.

                         BARBATUS
               You new, kid?

                         Z
               I just joined up.  But I'm quitting!
               I got a trial membership!

                         BARBATUS
               Trial membership?  Kid, when you join
               this ant's army, you're in for the
               full hitch.

     At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor
     they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the
     OPEN AIR outside of the colony.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT

     It's a starry, moonlit night.  The shadows crowd around the
     panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the
     march...

                         Z
               Wait a minute, there's been a
               mistake!  I've got to get back to the
               colony!

     Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking
     concerned, stops him.

                         BARBATUS
               Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot
               deserters!

     Z swallows hard.

                         BARBATUS
               You just stick by old Barbatus.
               He'll watch out for you.
                      (off Z's look)
               Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl
               behind?

                         Z
               Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of
               playing hard to get.  As a matter of
               fact, she's playing completely
               unattainable.
                      (nervously)
               So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk
               walk?  a foraging expedition?

                         BARBATUS
               No -- we're going to attack the
               termites!

                         Z
                      (alarmed)
               Attack?  But -- I hate attacking!
               It's so hostile!

     Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song,
     which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to
     form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the
     termite capital.

                         ANT SOLDIERS
                      (to the tune of "When
                       Johnny Comes
                       Marching Home")
               We ants go marching one by
               one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter
               termites just for fun, Hurrah!
               Hurrah!

                         Z
               So -- these termites, they're little,
               shy, retiring insects?

                         BARBATUS
                      (grim smile)
               No such luck.  Those dirty terms are
               five times bigger than us, and they
               shoot acid from their foreheads!

                         SOLDIER ANTS
               We ants go marching two by two,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead
               before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the
     screen, fading into another column marching diagonally
     downwards across the screen...

                         Z
               Well, what exactly does our platoon
               do?  Serve beverages?  Process
               paperwork?

                         BARBATUS
               Our platoon has the best assignment
               of all.  We're the first into battle!

                         ANT SOLDIERS
               We ants are marching three by three,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what
               we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     ...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of
     living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as
     they're getting stepped on...

                         Z
               So we're going back for more armor,
               right?  I mean, these guys are from
               outer space, how are we supposed to
               beat them?!

                         BARBATUS
               Superior numbers, kid!

     EXT. TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT

     Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE
     CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here
     it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts
     an order.

                         COLONEL
               ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!

     The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite
     colony...Z is swept along...

                         BARBATUS
               Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!

     Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
     ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.
     Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very
     middle of the termite colony...

     Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle
     of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but
     there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around
     suspiciously.

                         BARBATUS
               It's too damn quiet.

     Then we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over,
     and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.

                         BARBATUS
               Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's
               got yer back.

                         Z
                      (petrified)
               Maybe they went out for the evening.
               Let's leave them a message and head
               home.

                         COLONEL
                      (ignoring him)
               Light it up!

     A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and
     pinches him.  The firefly, yelling "Yipe!  Yipe!  Yipe!",
     shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of
     the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.

     Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like
     innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the
     stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of
     hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the
     tree, right onto the ant army.

                         COLONEL
               They're here!!!

                         BARBATUS
                      (to Z)
               Keep your head down!

     Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a
     BLOODBATH.  The ants have broken into the colony, but are
     taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing
     termites.  The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as
     something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's
     perspective, we see:

     -- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are
     literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid
     from its forehead...

     -- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is
     pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...

     -- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one
     and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...

                         Z
                      (looking around)
               Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for
               all of us to just talk this over!

     Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to
     face Z.  Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling
     monstrosity.

                         Z
               Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come
               out in spots!  -- Could I just say I
               have always had the greatest respect
               for your species?  I mean, eating
               wood -- why didn't I think of that?
               I --

     The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's
     knocked backwards by...

                         Z
               BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't get all sappy about it!

     As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the
     Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar.

                         COLONEL
               I love the smell of formic acid in
               the morning.

                         Z
               Look out!

     A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly
     burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's
     paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites
     rumbling towards them.  Z, terrified, dives into the hole
     that the huge termite made...

     INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     ...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound.
     The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with
     jagged access holes.

     No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes
     burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's
     head.  Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight
     through the wall in order to escape...

     INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

     ...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the
     Queen's chamber.  This is nothing like the civilized court of
     the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose
     walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled
     stones.

     The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long
     monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite
     nurses.  The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.

                         Z
               Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I
               was wondering if you could give me --

     Before Z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a
     piercing, blood-curdling shriek.  The nurses start shrieking
     too.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               I'll let myself out.

     But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the
     biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z,
     jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro!

     At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite
     runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber.  As
     if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and
     shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin
     to rumble...

     The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone
     falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and
     collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.

     As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and
     termites pour into the room from the corridors around and
     above...they keep struggling until...

                         ANT OFFICER
                      (points at Z)
               He's killed their Queen!

                         Z
               Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --

                         ANT OFFICER
               VICTORY!!!

     We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their
     leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey
     for the ants.

                         Z
                      (facetious)
               This is terrific!   Let's exact
               crippling war reparations!  Let's set
               up a puppet government!

                         ANT OFFICER
               Let's slaughter them all!

     The ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we
     hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look
     up confusedly...

     ...And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot
     long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a
     CRASH.  The ten or so ants standing directly below are
     smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva
     around the crater.  As quick as it appeared, the tongue
     retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound.  We can now see
     the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in
     the ceiling high above...

                         ANT OFFICER
               INCOMING!

     The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose
     bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but
     to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and
     again...

     Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down
     again, barely missing him!

     Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him,
     across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting
     closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants
     and struggling termites...

     ....Then the tongue disappears.  Silence.  Z wipes his brow...

     And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater
     searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down
     the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it
     ricochets along the walls!

     Z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him,
     reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana
     Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark!  The walls disintegrate
     under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to
     Z...closer...

     ...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down
     to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form
     of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final
     contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.

     EXT. TERMITE STUMP - MORNING

     Z makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an
     expression of horror on his face.

                         BARBATUS (O.S.)
               Z!  Over here!

                         Z
                      (hopeful)
               Barbatus?

     Z looks down at his feet, where Barbatus's still-living,
     decapitated head is looking up at him.

                         Z
                      (shocked)
               Barbatus!

                         BARBATUS
               Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?

                         Z
               No, no, you're...lookin' good.
               You've got good color in your cheeks.

                         BARBATUS
               No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm
               a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this
               ant's army, a soldier's life ain't
               worth a sack of fungus.
                      (he winces)
               I can't feel my legs...

                         Z
               Hang in there, buddy!  You can make
               it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll
               try and find your body -- it's gotta
               be around here somewhere!

                         BARBATUS
                      (gasping)
               I wonder...what...was it all...for...

                         Z
               Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't make my mistake, kid...
               don't...be a grunt...your whole
               life...

     Barbatus dies, leaving Z heartbroken.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Weaver is "passing" as a worker, working alongside much
     smaller worker ants.  He actually loves the work.  He's
     throwing up dirt like a bulldozer.  He's so enthusiastic, he
     scoops up a WHOLE ANT in his shovel and tosses him aside.
     Azteca, who's standing next to him in line, is shocked by,
     and a little attracted to, this turbo-worker.

                         AZTECA
               Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're
               making the rest of us look bad...How
               come I haven't seen you around here
               before?

                         WEAVER
                      (covering)
               I'm new...I was born yesterday.

                         AZTECA
               Tell me about it.

                         WEAVER
               Nobody told me digging was so much
               fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move
               it, you pick it up again, you move it
               again -- lots of repetitions, you
               exercise the forceps, and the
               pincers --

                         AZTECA
                      (ogling him)
               Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...

     While Azteca is checking out the hunky new worker, work has
     effectively stopped...clods are piling up behind Weaver.  A
     Foreman comes striding down the line, furious.

                         FOREMAN
               What's the holdup here?!

     Weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes, as if
     he's dealing with a superior officer.

                         WEAVER
               Sorry, sir -- I was just having a
               little chat with my friend --

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at Weaver)
               Who said you could have a chat?
               You're not a chatter, you're a
               digger!  So shut up and dig!

                         AZTECA
               Leave him alone!  He's new.

                         FOREMAN
               You  too?  Well just for that, you
               lose your day's rations!  Now get
               back to work!

     The Foreman heads down the line, shoving and berating the
     other workers as he goes along.

                         AZTECA
                      (surprised at herself)
               I don't know what came over me,
               talking back like that.  I must be
               going crazy...

                         WEAVER
               Sorry I got you in trouble.  But
               listen, you can share my rations.

                         AZTECA
                      (flirting)
               Are you asking me out to dinner?

                         WEAVER
                      (blushing)
               No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you
               don't have other plans.

                         AZTECA
               I'll make myself available...Listen,
               better watch out with the
               backtalk.  I don't know want you to
               end up like the guy who used to work
               next to me.  I'm afraid he got...
               downsized.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main
     entrance to the hive.

                         GUARD ANT
               Look!  They're back!  The army's
               back!  Alert the colony!

     The other ant starts ringing a bell, rushing down into the
     colony.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A huge crowd is forming, eager to welcome the army back.  A
     band is striking up a triumphant victory song, confetti and
     streamers are being thrown, as General Formica strides in,
     followed by Carpenter.

                         EXCITED ANTS
               The army's returned!  Our brave boys
               are back! (etc.)

     Everyone waves little flags as the tuba player Oompah-oompah-
     oompahs...

     ...and Z walks into the hall, looking bedraggled and
     exhausted, his helmet hanging over his ears.

     The band slows to a halt.

     At the edge of the crowd, Azteca, sitting on Weaver's
     shoulders, can just about see over the crowd.

                         AZTECA
               It looks like only one soldier made
               it back!

     Weaver looks distraught.

                         WEAVER
                      (to himself)
               Poor Z -- I should never have let you
               go!

     Far down the hall, Z is describing the battle.

                         Z
               It was horrible...a massacre, a
               massacre upon a massacre.  First we
               massacred them, then they massacred
               us, then it was halftime.  I've never
               seen such violence, such
               bloodthirstiness, such bad
               manners...I'm the only one that made
               it!

     The atmosphere is somber.  This is a tough one to try and put
     a spin on...but that doesn't stop Formica from trying.

                         FORMICA
               ONE TO NOTHING!  WE WIN!

     The band strikes up again, and everyone cheers.

                         Z
               No -- you -- you don't understand!

                         FORMICA
               Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish
               I had a hundred ants of your caliber.
               The world would tremble.  Now, time
               for some R and R.  You're invited to
               the royal victory party!

                         Z
               Royal victory party?  Will...will
               Princess Bala be there?

                         FORMICA
               Of course.  The entire royal family
               will be there to honor you.

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               ONE TO NOTHING!

     Renewed CHEERS, as Z is lifted onto the shoulder of some of
     the soldiers who stayed behind.

                         AZTECA
               Wait a minute, that's no soldier --
               that's Z!

                         WEAVER
               Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it!

     Z is following Formica away from the cheering crowd.

     EXT. ABOVE TOWN CENTER - DAY

     Z and Formica are going up the royal "stairway" together.

                         FORMICA
               Son, you're an ant after my own
               heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks
               death right in the face and laughs.

                         Z
               Well, I generally just make
               belittling comments and snicker
               behind death's back.  So, tell me,
               fellow war-monger...do you think
               Princess Bala likes men in uniform?

                         FORMICA
               Well she better -- she's engaged to
               one.  Me!

                         Z
               Engaged?  As in you're getting
               married?

                         FORMICA
               Affirmative.

                         Z
               So...you two are in love?

                         FORMICA
               In love?
                      (shakes his head)
               I'm just a plain old soldier at
               heart.  I'll tell you what I love --
               the field -- blood -- death --
               orders...and the company of other
               warriors.

     Formica gives Z a manly slap on the back.  Z looks a little
     uncomfortable as we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Z follows Formica and Carpenter into the throne room.  At the
     end of the hall, a society band is playing.  The room is full
     of courtier ants and officers.

     Waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors d'ouevres.

                         Z
               Wow, what a spread -- you know,
               there's a food shortage in the rest
               of the colony.

                         FORMICA
               Yes, and do you know why there's a
               food shortage?

                         Z
               ...Not enough food?

                         FORMICA
               Negatory.  Too many ants.  And while
               we soldiers go out there, and fight,
               and bleed, and die for the colony,
               the namby-pamby workers live it up
               back home.

     Feeling a little hot, Z wipes his brow.

                         Z
               Well I, I don't think "living it up"
               is the right term -- how about
               "working themselves to death"?

                         FORMICA
               I tell you son, sometimes, at night,
               I see myself in battle, fighting a
               horrible, faceless enemy, with the
               future of our whole species at stake.
               And always, the dream ends with each
               of us plunging his sword into the
               other's heart...

                         Z
                      (spooked)
               Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see
               an old war buddy over there, it's
               been fun chatting.  Good luck with
               the hallucinations.

     Z escapes from Formica, who gazes after him suspiciously.

     Z mingles in with the crowd, then he sees Princess Bala
     standing with a group of officers who are eating hors
     d'oeuvres.

                         OFFICER
                      (telling a joke)
               What do you call it when 10,000
               workers are killed in a tunnel cave-
               in?
                      (a beat)
               Who cares?  They're workers!

     The officers laugh, but Bala looks bored in this stuffy
     social scene.

                         Z
               But...don't you think the worker
               class is the very foundation of the
               colony --
                      (realizes he's
                       getting odd looks)
               I mean, uh, without them, who would
               we stand on?

     More laughter.

                         BALA
               You're the hero of the recent termite
               campaign, aren't you?

                         Z
               Well, if single-handedly vanquishing
               the enemy and slaughtering a whole
               nestful of termites makes someone a
               hero, yes I am.

     Z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by,
     and KNOCKS the whole thing CLATTERING to the ground.

                         Z
                      (feigning nonchalance)
               And you are...?

                         BALA
               I'm Princess Bala.

                         Z
               Ah, yes.
                      (affected)
               Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So,
               Princess, have you ever danced with
               a hero?

                         BALA
               Yes.

                         Z
                      (deflated)
               Oh...oh well then, one more won't
               matter.

     She moves towards the dance floor.  Z spit-combs his
     antennae, struts after her -- until he trips on his sword.
     He tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as Bala turns
     toward him, turning it into a ballet plies.

                         Z
               Just warming up...

     She frowns...there's something familiar about this guy.  But
     then they start dancing.

     ACROSS THE ROOM: The Queen and General Formica watch the
     party.

                         QUEEN
               All these parties are so marvellously
               alike.

                         FORMICA
               They should be...
                      (suspicious)
               But there's something funny about
               that soldier.

     Formica strides over to where Z and Bala are dancing.

                         FORMICA
                      (glowering)
               May I cut in?

                         Z
                      (intimidated)
               Oh, of course --

                         BALA
                      (pulling Z back)
               No, General.  I'm dancing with the
               war hero.

                         Z
                      (trying to placate
                       Formica)
               Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always
               had this animal magnetism, it --

     Bala YANKS Z back onto the dance floor, dancing away from
     Formica.

                         BALA
               You dance...

                         Z
               Divinely?

                         BALA
               No weirdly...You remind me of
               someone...

     Formica catches Bala's eye.  She frowns at him, and decides
     to get a little shocking.

                         BALA
               He was swarthy...primitive...
               earthy...sensual.

     As she says these things, Z tries to act accordingly.

                         BALA
               He was a worker.  I danced with him
               at a worker's bar just the other day.
               I'm not shocking you, am I?

                         Z
                      (proudly)
               No...as a matter of fact...

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A
               WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid,
               disgusting WORKER!

     Everybody gasps.  The dancing stops cold.

                         Z
               Gee, uh, could you say it a little
               louder, I think there are some ants
               in the next colony who didn't hear
               you.

                         BALA
               I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!

                         Z
                      (offended)
               That's not what you said the other
               night --

                         BALA
                      (now she's panicked)
               Quiet -- sshhh!!

                         Z
                      (digging it in)
               -- At the worker bar!  You were
               pretty hot to trot then!

                         BALA
               SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!

     A livid Formica is stalking over towards them.

                         FORMICA
                      (furious)
               What's this?  A worker has been
               masquerading as a war hero?!

                         Z
               Well it wasn't a masquerade, really,
               it was more what I'd call a clever
               ruse --

                         FORMICA
               ARREST HIM!

                         Z
               Can't we all settle this like
               adults -- we're not larvae anymore --

     Angry officers begin to surround Z, who hides behind Bala in
     fear, using her as a shield.

                         QUEEN
               Oh my god!  He's taking her hostage!

                         Z
               No I'm not -- I mean -- nobody move!
               Or the Princess gets it!

     People shout and scream, as Z backs up with the
     Princess...into the kitchen.

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Z backs up into the kitchen, still pulling Bala along with
     him.  Here, ant chefs are preparing food for the party,
     vomiting little florets onto a platter.  Formica and the
     soldiers follow them in.

                         Z
                      (to Formica)
               Stay back, you lunatic!  Do you think
               I don't know how to use this?

     Z realizes that he's pointing his finger at them.

                         Z
               Uh-oh.

     The officers rush for...and Z, with Bala in tow, falls
     backwards into an opening marked, "GARBAGE".

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     HOLD ON: the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT.  Nothing happens for a
     moment.  Then --

     From a distance, we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING,
     dopplering closer --

     -- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit, right
     into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly.

     Bala sits up, coated in mud.  Z is nowhere to be seen.
     Because she's on top of him.

                         PRINCESS
               This is thoroughly unacceptable!

                         Z
               You're telling me...

     She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where
     soldiers are already issuing to get her...

                         BALA
               I'm coming!  I'm coming!

     But...just as Bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a
     gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony,
     sizzling the ground as it moves along...and IGNITES the lead
     soldier into FLAMES!  Bala looks stunned.

     Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we
     look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the
     beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure
     (a seven year old kid) holding it.

     Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the
     colony and runs the other way.

                         BALA
               I'm going!  I'm going'

     ...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which
     follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING
     in her footsteps.

     Z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that
     he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging
     it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts
     into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some
     flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some
     grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. WEED CLUMP - DAY

     Z and Bala dust themselves off.

                         BALA
               What was that thing?

                         Z
               How should I know?

                         BALA
               I order you to find out where we are!

                         Z
               Alright, alright, I'll try to get
               directions from one of the locals.

     Z tries to flag down some passing bees.

                         Z
               Excuse me, I --
                      (it passes him by;
                       he tries the next)
               Pardon me --
                      (same response)
               And they call them social insects.

                         BALA
               Climb up that tree and get a better
               view!

     Bala points to a thin blade of grass.  Gingerly, Z tests the
     grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so
     that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down
     face with Bala.

                         BALA
               I've been kidnapped by the village
               idiot.

                         Z
               Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot
               who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who
               lets herself get kidnapped by the
               idiot?

                         BALA
               How dare you speak to me like that?
               I'm the Princess!

     Z squares up with her.

                         Z
               Theoretically, yes.  But is the
               monarchical hierarchy applicable
               without the underlying social
               structure to support it?

                         BALA
               Of course!  It defines society!  To
               deny the precept is to say that order
               is an arbitrary distinction applied
               by the society itself!

                         Z
               But can there be a society composed
               of just two ants?

                         BALA
               No!  There's no such thing as "just
               two ants."  You never see just two
               ants -- you see a million ants!

                         Z
               Look around, sweetheart.

     She looks around.  She doesn't like what she sees.  She
     glowers at Z.

                         BALA
               I -- hate -- you.

                         Z
               Well I guess that makes us even.

                         BALA
               Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're
               crazy about me!  That's why you lied
               and cheated to get near me!

                         Z
               Oh come on, you're the one who came
               after me -- the swarthy, earthy,
               sensual worker!

                         BALA
                      (repulsed)
               I was slumming it!  I danced with you
               because you were the most pathetic
               specimen in the place!

                         Z
               Is that the same standard you used to
               choose General Formica?

                         BALA
               I didn't choose him.  What kind  of
               idiot would...
                      (unconvincingly)
               ...choose who she wanted to marry?

     She shakes herself out of it.

                         BALA
               Now, worker, you shall take me back
               to the colony, and have your head cut
               off and stuck on a sharp pole!

                         Z
               Well, that's an appealing offer,
               but...considering the options...
                      (he decides)
               You go back.  Me, I'm going to
               Insectopia.

                         BALA
               Insectopia?  You stupid worker,
               that's just a fairy tale!

                         Z
               Yeah, well I have it on a reliable
               source...
                      (he knows that was
                       maybe stretching it)
               that it exists.  Now you follow
               the yellow egg...
                      (looking around)
               That direction.

                         BALA
               Worker!  Come back here now!

                         Z
               I've got a name.  It's Z.

                         BALA
               That's not a name!  That's just a
               letter!

     Z, meanwhile, hits the road.  Bala has no idea of where to
     go.  Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes
     through to her.

     We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle
     sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING,
     CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all
     directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing
     her with his beady gaze.

                         BALA
                      (clears her throat)
               Worker?
                      (no response...louder
                       now)
               Oh WORKER?  Where are you?
                      (getting desperate)
               Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!!

     Bala heads off after Z.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     The mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel.
     The foreman moves up the line, BERATING the workers, yelling
     at them to dig faster.

                         AZTECA
               I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein'
               yelled at.

                         WORKER #1
               What do you want, we're just workers.

                         WEAVER
               You know, you're not just workers --
               you can be whatever you want to be!
               Look at Z!  He started as a worker --
               then he became a soldier!

                         AZTECA
               That's right!  He slaughtered
               hundreds of termites single-handedly!

                         WORKER #2
               I heard about this guy.
                      (turning to the other
                       workers)
               He crashed a party at the palace.
               Then he took a hike with one of the
               royal babes!  And when they tried to
               stop him, he just looked at a
               couple'a guards, and they burst into
               flames!

                         WORKER ANT #1
               You're nuts, how could a worker do
               all that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, because he's more than a
               worker...he's a...what did he call
               it, Azteca...

                         AZTECA
               Invisible!

                         WEAVER
               No -- an individual!

                         WORKER #2
               What's that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, it's...someone with his own
               point of view...someone who does what
               he wants, not whatever he's told to
               do!

                         AZTECA
                      (eyes lit up,
                       watching Weaver)
               Someone who follows his heart!

                         WEAVER
                      (taking Azteca's hand)
               Right...because every ant's important!

                         WORKER #2
                      (scoffs)
               But that would mean I'm important.

                         WORKER #1
               I'm outta here, this sounds like
               trouble to me.

     But more ants are gathering 'round.

                         WEAVER
               We can all be individuals!  Just like
               Z!

     Weaver and Azteca hold hands.  More ants are gathering
     around, dropping their tools...

     EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY

     LONG SHOT.  A glimmering desert landscape (think of "The
     Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia).  Two small figures can
     be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness.

     They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the
     park, which they perceive to be a "desert".

                         BALA
               Water...water...

                         Z
               Water...water -- oh, you already said
               that.

                         BALA
                      (walking along)
               My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is
               cracking...I wish I'd never met you,
               you ruined my life.

                         Z
               I ruined your life?  Look, I was
               perfectly happy until I met you --
               alright, I was miserable, but I was
               happily miserable.

     Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger
     and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL
     (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards
     them).

                         BALA
               Look out!

     Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past
     with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a
     gigantic millwheel.

                         BALA
               We're going to die!

                         Z
               Come on -- it's gone!  What are the
               chances of that happening again?

     No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike
     thunders past.

                         Z
               Well I'll be.

     Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she
     pushes him away.

                         BALA
               Why didn't I listen to my mother
               ...why'd I have to go looking for
               trouble? Any ant would have given
               their left legs to be in my
               position...what's wrong with me?

                         Z
               Want a list?

                         BALA
                      (urgent)
               Wait, I hear something!

     We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause
     and then we can hear it again...

     Z and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the
     path).  Beyond, the grass starts up again.  They have come to
     the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path)
     Through the blades of grass, we can see...

                         Z
               It's...it's...


                         BALA
               WATER!!!

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them.  It is, in fact, the
     overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed...as Z
     and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain
     and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall).

     Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping.
     They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't
     like each other.

                         Z
               This lake is huge!  And so close to
               the colony!  Think of the vacation
               potential!

                         BALA
               Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take
               a nap.

                         Z
               Listen, "Princess", you can't order
               me around.  Out here, you're not the
               boss anymore -- out here, you're
               just --

     -- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the
     fountain falls on him.  It may not sound like much, but to Z
     it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had
     engulfed him.

     Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the
     droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down.
     Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for
     help.  But his screams are muffled in the water.

                         BALA
                      (annoyed)
               Out here I'm just what?

                         Z
                      (through the water)
               Hlllllllp!

                         BALA
                      (hands on hips)
               Stop fooling around in there.

     By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned
     upside-down.  He manages to get one foreleg out of the
     droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls
     Bala in by the leg.

                         BALA
               Let me go!!!

     But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet,
     and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala
     yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is
     she's yelling through the water.

     Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing,
     alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries
     to defend himself.  Finally all this commotion is enough to
     make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing,
     sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground.

     They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.

                         BALA
                      (chants to herself)
               I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm
               going to be rescued soon.  I'm going
               to be rescued soon.

     Z watches her incredulously.

                         Z
               Princess, has it ever occurred to you
               that they're not going to rescue you?

                         BALA
               General Formica won't let me die out
               here.  I'm his fiancee.

                         Z
               Look.  How many other Princesses are
               there?

                         BALA
               Five thousand three hundred and
               ninety -- no.  About five thousand
               four hundred by now.

                         Z
               And only you can become a Queen?

                         BALA
               Well...no, but --

                         Z
               So what makes you so special?

                         BALA
                      (hesitates)
               Well...I am the oldest.

     Bala turns from Z.  She's thinking things over, realization
     dawning on her.

                         BALA
               By three seconds...

     She looks out into the grass forest.

                         BALA
                      (to herself)
               You're right.  There are as many
               Princesses...as there are blades of
               grass.

     Z, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Formica and Carpenter are walking into the entrance of the
     tunnel with a squad of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1!
               We can't afford any delays on this
               project!

                         CARPENTER
               I've never seen anything like it,
               General, they're they're...well, look!

     Ahead of them, a group of a few hundred workers have stopped
     work and are sitting down, chanting...

                         WORKER ANTS
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     A worker moves forward to join the strikers, tossing down his
     tool.

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at him)
               Where do ya think you're going?  Get
               back to work!

                         WORKER #1
               Buzz off, I'm important!
                      (joining the others)
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!


     At the center of the group, Weaver and Azteca are holding
     hands, leading the chant.

                         FORMICA
               Notice the big one, holding hands
               with the female?

                         CARPENTER
               Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?

                         FORMICA
                      (calculating)
               No one should have to.  Have him
               brought to me.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

     A nervous Weaver is sitting across from Formica, flanked by
     a couple of stoic guards.  Carpenter stands smiling by the
     side door.  There is no obvious threat to Weaver, but the
     atmosphere is truly intimidating.

                         FORMICA
               So this Z...he fancies himself an
               individual?

                         WEAVER
               Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know,
               really, sir.

                         FORMICA
                      (patronizing)
               Well now you haven't fallen for this
               silly idea of individuality, have
               you?

                         WEAVER
               Oh, no, sir!

                         FORMICA
               Good.  You're a good soldier.

                         WEAVER
               Thank you, sir.

     Weaver begins to relax a bit.

                         FORMICA
               So tell me.  Where's Z?

                         WEAVER
               I...I have no idea, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Okay, son.

     He pats Weaver on the shoulder.

                         FORMICA
               We know what makes an ant colony
               strong, don't we?  We know that no
               ant can be an individual.  No single
               ant matters, right?

                         WEAVER
                      (enthusiastically)
               That's correct, sir!

                         FORMICA
                      (points at a guard)
               Not that one.
                      (another guard)
               Or that one.

                         WEAVER
               No, sir!

     Formica nods at Carpenter, who smiles and opens a door.  Two
     soldiers walk in, holding Azteca.  The color drains from
     Weaver's face.

                         FORMICA
                      (calmly, with
                       satisfaction)
               Or that one?  Her life doesn't
               matter, does it?

                         AZTECA
               Don't tell that tightass anything,
               Weaver!

     Weaver starts to get up, but the guards behind him hold him
     down.

                         WEAVER
               Wait!  Just let her go!  Z's long
               gone anyway, following some golden
               egg to Insectopia!  You'll never
               catch him!

     Formica's face lights up.

                         FORMICA
               Insectopia, hunh?...See why
               individuality is so dangerous?  It
               can always be used against you.
                      (to the guards)
               If this sissy here wants to dig,
               he'll dig.  Send them both back to
               the tunnel project.  Double their
               workload.

     The guards exit with Weaver and Azteca.

                         FORMICA
               What do we have on this "Insectopia"?

                         CARPENTER
               Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors.
               Nothing reliable.

                         FORMICA
               Desperate times call for desperate
               measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.

                         CARPENTER
                      (frightened)
               Ant Team Six...

     EXT.  GRASS JUNGLE - DAY

     Z and Bala are lost, wandering through the grass

                         BALA
                      (looking hopeless)
               I swear, we've passed this blade of
               grass three times.

     Z keeps marching on.

                         BALA
               Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have
               walked halfway across the world by
               now!  How did I get into this mess...

                         Z
                      (too shy to look at
                       her)
               Come on...tell me there wasn't just
               a little...something between us that
               first night at the bar.  The night we
               danced.

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               What difference does it make...we're
               both going to starve to death, or get
               squished, or set on fire...

     But Z is just gawking.  The shot expands to show that they
     have stumbled onto...

                         Z
               ...The land of red and white...

     EXT. FALSE INSECTOPIA - DAY

     A PICNICGROUNDS...A red and white picnic blanket, which to
     the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion, stretches
     before them.  They gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper
     shaker.

     Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato
     salad, and sandwiches stacked high.  It all looks perfect,
     with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist
     architecture.  In fact, it looks a little too perfect.

                         Z
               We've found it!  Insectopia!  Look at
               all this food'

                         BALA
                      (amazed)
               You were right...you were right!
                      (smiling happily)
               Z, it's beautiful!

                         Z
               Let's dig in!

     Z goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but -- BOOIIING! -- he's
     prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it.

                         Z
               There's - there's some kind of force
               field!

     Bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap.  Then both
     of them hear laughter from above.

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (lockjawed accent)
               Muffy, look, party-crashers.

                         FEMALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (laughing)
               They're simply too much, Chip!

     Bala and Z look up to see two large, yellow WASPS hovering in
     the air above them.  The husband and wife wasps have
     lockjawed, William F. Buckleyesque accents.

                         MALE WASP
                      (to Z and Bala)
               You down there, haven't you ever been
               to a picnic?

                         Z
               Hunh?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Habla Ingles?
                      (to Male Wasp)
               Well I really don't know who they are.

                         Z
               We're ants!

     The Male Wasp zooms in closer.

                         MALE WASP
               Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we?
                      (to Z)
               Are you related to the Fifth Avenue
               ants?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Darling, do you have to talk to any
               insect from off the street?

                         MALE WASP
               Just being friendly, Poopsie.

                         BALA
               Hello?  I'm not just "any insect".
               My mother is the Queen.
                      (momentously)
               I'm Princess Bala!

                         MALE WASP
                      (under his breath)
               They're Eurotrash, dear.

     We hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit
     down for their picnic lunch.  Gigantic hands reach down and
     pull away the "force fields".

                         MALE WASP
               Lunch!
                      (to Z)
               A little piece of advice, sport --
               bob and weave!  Bob and weave!

                         BALA
               What do you mean?

                         MALE WASP
               Well -- like my father used to say --
               there's no such thing as a free meal!

     The wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and
     then dashing away again...

                         THE WASPS
               Excuse me -- I'll have some potato
               salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if
               I do!  After you! (etc.)

     -- But all is not well.  We pull back to reveal that Z and
     Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is
     attached to a giant sneaker.  Which moves.

                         Z
               I sort of imagined Insectopia a
               little differently --

     Just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and
     the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out
     of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an
     aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground.

                         BALA
               Oh...my...God.

                         MALE WASP
                      (shaking her)
               Muffy!  Muffy!  Wake up!

     But she doesn't move.  The Male Wasp stares up at the sky.

                         MALE WASP
                      (heartbroken)
               WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????

     But Z, also looking up, has no time to commiserate.

                         Z
               Bala, look out!!

     They are only saved by the fact that they are so small - .the
     holes of the swatter pass over them.

     The woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants,
     throws it to the side and tries stomping on them...

     Before Bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a
     thunderous BOOM that shakes the ground.

                         BALA
               MMMffllmmm...

     The shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away...and we
     see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle-
     soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum!

                         BALA
               Z!  Help me!!!

     But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping,
     ferris-wheel-like motion.  BOOM.  The sneaker on which Bala
     is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on Z, too --

                         Z
               Bala!
                      (mournfully)
               I'll never see her again...

     -- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing
     Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --

                         BALA
               Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere!

     -- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get
     the bubblegum off her shoe...Z heart sinks as the shoe Bala's
     stuck on lopes off into the distance...

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               These things always come in twos...

     He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --

                         Z
               Take me to your leader!

     Z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment
     catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace.

                         Z
               Whoooooooaaaa!!!

     The sneaker lifts off into the air, with Z holding on for
     dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away
     from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the
     landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the
     background...

                         Z
               Bala!  Come back here!

     For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it
     descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free-
     fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again...

                         BALA
               Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck!

     --  But Z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends.
     The sneaker hits the ground, and Z can feel himself
     again...it's now or never.

                         Z
                      (Tarzan whoop)
               Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!

     As the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling
     through the air and catching one of the laces of Bala's
     sneaker...the momentum swings him up and under the sole...

                         BALA
               Z!  You're here!

     Z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala.  Now he's
     stuck too.

                         Z
                      (ruefully)
               Yeah.  I'm here.

     The sneaker descends again.  Z and Bala hold hands and SCREAM
     as they see the ground rise too meet them...

     THUD!  They're squished deeper into the bubblegum.  The
     sneaker rises again...

                         BALA
                      (emotional)
               Z...if we don't make it...I just want
               you to know....

                         Z
                      (touched)
               Yes?

                         BALA
               This is all your fault!!!

     The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but
     instead it just hovers there.  (The person wearing it is
     balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum
     with a penny).

                         Z
               We're safe...

     Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny
     is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high.  The huge image
     of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them.

                         Z
               Who the hell is that?!!!

     The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker,
     bringing Bala and Z along with it.  They're carried through
     the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over
     in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM...

     ...and land with a CRASH in total darkness.

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     The "lake" where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water
     droplet.

     The earth shakes as a HUGE, MONSTROUS creature approaches the
     lake - and begins to drink from it.  The creature seems to
     hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head.  It's a
     Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen
     from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie.

                         TOUGH VOICE (O.S.)
               Ant Team Six -- take him out!

     The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching
     intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though
     they're attacking the Death Star!

     The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are
     making a diversionary run...

     and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his
     soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy.

     The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away, YIPPING!

     The members of ANT TEAM SIX, a crack team of hardcore flying-
     ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and
     land.

                         MAJOR MANDIBLE
               And don't come back, you sissy!

     MAJOR MANDIBLE, Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into
     frame.  He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier.
     The rest of his team fan out to search the area.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO ANT
               Z and the Princess were here, sir.
               Signs of a struggle.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's get a read on that feremone
               track.

                         COMMANDO ANT #1
                      (to the others)
               Get the sniffer!

     Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a
     piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a
     highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense
     of smell.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...find Bala...

     The tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs
     the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter...

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (as he's swivelled)
               Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono
               no...

     Finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one
     direction and saying, "Yeahyeahyeahyeah..."

                         COMMANDO ANT #3
               Got 'em!  Ten clicks from here!

                         MANDIBLE
               Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing,
               wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel
               SCUM!
                      (yelling into the
                       distance)
               I AM COMING FOR YOU!  YOU ARE ONE
               DEAD ANT, MISTER!

     Mandible's muscles bulge.  The veins in his head throb.  This
     is one ass-kicking ant.  Even Mandible's troops look scared
     of him.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's MOVE!  GO, people!  GO!  GO!
               GO!  GO!  GO!

     Ant Team Six takes to the air, heading in the direction
     indicated by the tracker ant.

     INT. TRASH BAG - DAY

     Darkness.  Out of it we hear the voices of Z and Bala.

                         BALA
               Come on, Z.

                         Z
               Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up.
               I...I don't know what I was thinking.
               "Insectopia".

     In one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little
     hole through which a shaft of light is falling.  Bala
     proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and
     bigger...

                         Z
                      (defeated)
               There's only one thing worse than an
               ant who goes around mindlessly
               following orders, and that's an ant
               who's too dumb to go around
               mindlessly following orders.

     Bala stops...she notices that they're being watched.  She's
     emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop
     away gracefully.  Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage
     area.  And above them and below them, peering from garbage
     cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural
     assortment of insects are regarding them.

     A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts.

                         FLY
               What's with the bummer attitude?

     A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in.

                         BUTTERFLY
               Yeah -- nobody stresses out in
               Insectopia!

                         BALA
               Did you say...

                         Z
                      (joining Bala)
               ...Insectopia?

     Z and Bala look around.  Just to get things straight, the
     garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- that would be seeing
     it through human eyes.  Instead, we're looking at it through
     ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise.  Not the
     ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land
     of plenty.

     The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective
     walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic,
     thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the
     pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a
     gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into
     the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which
     appears as a multi-chambered concave dome.  Everywhere,
     insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in
     that's like an insect version of Woodstock.

     Bala and Z are awe-struck.  Bala turns to Z.

                         BALA
                      (happily)
               Z, we made it!

                         FLY
                      (alighting on the
                       grapefruit)
               C'mon in!  The nectar's fine!

     Like a kid at an amusement park, Z slides down the smooth
     side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he
     slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped
     tunnel), and is shot out...

                         Z
               Yippeeeeee!

     ...into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade, which he
     alternately drinks and swims through...

     Down at the bottlecap, Z is drying himself off.  Then he
     sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic TERMITE.

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               AAAAAGH!!!

     Surprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified...

                         FLY
                      (to Z)
               Hey, take it easy!  There's nothin'
               to be afraid of!

                         Z
               Yeah, well, I make it a practice not
               to trust anyone who shoots acid out
               of their forehead.

                         CRICKET
               Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't
               judge people by how many arms and
               legs we've got.

                         FLY
               Yeah, back home, they called me a
               fruitfly.  But here, I'm known
               as...
                      (with attitude)
               Superfly.

                         CRICKET
               Anyway, big Gus is mellow.

     The termite sticks his hand out.  A drop of acid drips from
     his head and splashes at Z's feet.

                         Z
                      (taking his hand,
                       disgusted)
               Charmed.

     Z reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as Bala watches,
     smiling.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     The insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by
     the still-red ember of a match.  Platters heaped with food
     lie untouched as they pat their bellies...

     Z and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they
     had just met for the first time.

                         Z
               So...you never did tell me...what
               made you come out to the worker bar
               that night?

                         BALA
               Just looking for fun, adventure,
               trouble, I guess.

                         Z
               Well, "trouble" is my middle name.
               Actually, my  middle name is .985,
               but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala,
               I...I actually have something of
               yours...you left it at the bar that
               night.

     Z takes out Bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in
     a pocket.

                         Z
               Sorry, it's been through a war, not
               to mention everything else...

                         BALA
               You held onto this all that time?

                         Z
               Well, I...I know it's a little
               strange, but...I thought it might
               come in handy if I...needed a scarf
               someday.
                      (embarrassed)
               Well, to be honest, I just liked
               having it.

     He hands it back to her.  Bala looks at Z, frankly, openly.
     For a moment Z is shy.  Then he looks at her too.  They're
     two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss,
     when --

                         BEETLE
               Hey Z!

     The moment is wrecked.  Z looks up.  A chubby beetle stands
     there with Gus the termite.

                         BEETLE
               Wanna bring back dessert?  There's a
               thirty foot long blimp in the next
               can, made completely of chocolate!

                         Z
                      (annoyed)
               Sure.  I wasn't busy or anything.

     Z gets up to go with them.

                         Z
               Great timing, guys.  Ever wonder why
               they call you "pests"?

     EXT.  INSECTOPIA, TOP OF CAN - NIGHT

     As Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast.
     The tracker ant is going nuts.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yesyesyesyesyes --

     One of the commandoes puts his hand over the tracker's mouth
     to shut him up.  Mandible communicates with his troops by
     pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly
     whispering into it, as though it were one of those commando
     headsets.  His troops do likewise.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO #1
               I've got a read on the Princess --
               but target Z isn't accounted for.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's move in.

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Back at the feast, a cricket strums on his legs like a
     guitar, opining about life and the universe to a bunch of
     other chilled-out, hippyesque insects...Bala taps her feet to
     the song.

                         CRICKET
               What if, like...we're just these tiny
               little things, and we're just like
               part of this whole other huge
               universe, that's like, so big we
               don't even know it exists?

                         LADYBUG
               Man...that's so deep...

     At that moment Ant Team Six rapels down from the top of the
     garbage bin, landing amongst the insects.

                         MANDIBLE
               EVERYBODY DOWN!

     The cricket gets up to confront Mandible, but Mandible cold
     cocks him with a right to the jaw.  The other insects, too
     surprised to fight, just do as they're told.

                         MANDIBLE
               Alright, you hippy scum!  Make one
               move and I'll exterminate you!

     A couple of commandoes grab Bala by the arms and heave her up.

                         BALA
               Stop!  You don't understand!

                         MANDIBLE
               I don't have to understand, Missy --
               I've got orders.  Now where's Z?

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Z, the termite, the beetle and the fly are happily carrying
     a huge M&M back to the feast.

                         FLY
               Man, your girl is fly, know what I'm
               saying?

                         Z
                      (overdoing it)
               Oh, Bala?  I guess she's okay, you
               know, for a princess.  I mean, I
               usually date queens, or you know,
               empresses, because sometimes the
               lesser nobility are too much in awe
               of my smouldering sensuality.  Please
               stop me if I'm making you feel
               inadequate.

     They throw down the M&M, which lands with a THUD.  Z notices
     that the rest of the insects look spooked.

                         Z
               What's the matter?  This place is as
               cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out
               time.

     Z looks around.

                         LADYBUG
               Bala's been kidnapped!  Some flying
               ants took her back to the colony!

                         Z
               She's been kidnapped?!  But I can't
               live without her!

     Z just stands there, heartbroken.

                         Z
                      (determined)
               I'm going back.  I've got to get her.
               Who'll come with me?

     Z looks around.  Nobody's volunteering.  Nothing but sheepish
     looks and shuffling from the insects of Insectopia.

     Z looks disheartened.  He's about to leave when --

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
               I'll go.

     The male wasp is hovering nearby.

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You?!

                         MALE WASP
               I know what it's like to lose
               someone...I keep hearing the sound of
               Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take
               you.

     Z hops on the wasp's back.

                         Z
               Let's go, pal!

     The wasp takes off, leaving the other insects looking a
     little chastized.

                         FLY
               Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. SKY ABOVE COLONY - MORNING

     The wasp and Z fly high above the colony...

                         Z
               Wow...I never saw things this way...

     From here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the
     colony...the "desert" (an asphalt path) and across it, the
     "lake" (the overflowing water fountain)

                         Z
               Things look so close together from up
               here...there's the desert...and the
               lake...
                      (thinking about
                       something)
               it's not far from the colony at all...

     Suddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air.

                         MALE WASP
               Sorry.  Turbulence.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Formica sits at his desk, going over some plans.  Formica's
     chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye
     sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door.
     The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other
     insects.

     Ant Team Six burst in the doors of Formica's office, carrying
     the struggling and kicking Bala.  One of the commandoes sets
     the tracker ant one the floor...then Formica gets up from his
     desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him.

                         FORMICA
               Princess Bala.  Good.
                      (with urgency)
               Where's Z?

     Bala replies warily.

                         BALA
               He's...he's dead.
                      (covering for Z)
               You don't have to look for him
               anymore.  He was eaten by a praying
               mantis.

                         FORMICA
                      (regretfully)
               It's a shame he died prematurely...I
               was hoping to kill him myself.

                         BALA
               Well you'll never be able to hurt him
               where he is now.
                      (sadly)
               I miss him already.

                         FORMICA
                      (surprised)
               You miss him?  Why?

                         BALA
                      (angry)
               Because...because he's twice the ant
               that you are.  I could never go
               through with marrying you.  I'm --
               I'm an individual, and when I get
               married, it'll be to someone I choose.

     The soldiers look shocked.  For a moment, Formica looks
     furious.  Then he just shrugs.

                         FORMICA
                      (shaking his head)
               Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old
               soldier, and the ways of the feminine
               mind are a little too complex for me.
               But one thing I do know is, there are
               more Princesses where you came from.
               I just hope they're not all like you.
               In the meantime, maybe we can arrange
               for you to see Z again after all.

     He gestures to the commandoes, who drag her out the door.  We
     notice that the tracker ant has been left behind.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Z hops down from the wasp, who has landed near the entrance
     to the colony.

                         MALE WASP
               Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect,
               you're alright by me.

                         Z
               Thanks, Chip.

     They shake hands and the wasp flies off.

                         Z
                      (to himself)
               How am I going to get in?  The place
               is crawling with soldiers!

     Z starts for the nearest entrance -- but he's spotted by a
     couple of SOLDIER ANTS.

                         SOLDIER ANT
               You there!  Worker!

     Z's caught -- it's over.  He turns around with his hands up.

                         Z
               Don't bite!  I surrender!

                         SOLDIER ANT
               What are you doing out here!  All
               workers are to remain inside the
               colony, by orders of General Formica!

     Z can't believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued.

                         Z
                      (heading inside)
               Well...if you insist...

     INT. MEGATUNNEL - DAY

     The Queen, with Formica striding at her side, is carried by
     a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the
     bottom end of the Mega Tunnel, where a red ribbon waits to be
     cut.

                         QUEEN
               Very impressive, General.

     Behind her, hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded,
     looking confused and expectant.  Some of them clutch little
     flags and noisemakers...

                         MANDIBLE
               Wave that flag, you maggot!

     ...which we see are being handed out to them by Ant Team Six.

                         FORMICA
               Is there anything wrong, your majesty?

     The Queen is looking around unhappily.

                         QUEEN
               It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish
               she were here for this special moment.

     Formica warmly places his hand on the Queen's shoulder.

                         FORMICA
                      (falsely supportive)
               She is, your majesty.  She is.

     The CAMERA heads up the long, long tunnel, where we see...

     INT. MID SKYLIGHT TUNNEL

     Bala, tied and gagged.  She's at the point in the Megatunnel
     where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface.  She
     struggles against her bonds, but can't get loose.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Elsewhere in the colony, a column of soldiers marches by, and
     we hear the TROMP-TROMP-TROMP of their boots.  When they've
     gone, Z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirt...he
     heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers...

     INT. OUTSIDE FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Z creeps around the outside of Formica's chambers.  This part
     of the colony seems to be deserted.

                         Z
               Geez, this place really empties out
               in August.  Where is everybody?

     Z walks up to the skull that houses Formica's chambers and
     peeks in the eye socket.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS

     Inside, the Tracker Ant, who's been left behind, switches
     "on", eyes glowing.  Z enters the chamber cautiously.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (sniffing)
               Z!  Z!  I smell Z!

     For a moment, Z's afraid.  Then he sees the small Tracker Ant
     doesn't seem hostile.

                         Z
               You "smell" me?  Well look, I -- I've
               been out in the wilderness for a
               while, and --

     The tracker ant keeps sniffing.  Z waves his hand in front of
     the blind ant's eyes.

                         Z
                      (getting it)
               Hey, wait, you're...you're one of
               those pheremone sniffers, aren't you?
               Maybe you can help me...I'm looking
               for a friend of mine, Princess Bala.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (enthusiastic)
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah!

     Z picks up the tracker ant.

                         Z
               Just remember, I met her first.

     Z, carrying the little tracker ant, heads out, following its
     lead...

     Through this and that passage, as the Tracker Ant gets more
     and more insistent...And finally straight to a blank wall.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Bala's through there?

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Great.  More digging.  This is why I
               left in the first place.

     Z can answer his own question.  He puts down the tracker ant,
     with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli,
     starts digging through the wall...

     INT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

     Meanwhile, A member of Ant Team Six -- the stupidest member,
     in fact, waits at the very top of the tunnel, where it
     narrows almost to a point.  He's hanging from a winch, and
     has a little hammer and chisel in his hand.  He's WHISTLING,
     awaiting instructions.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z emerges from the tunnel he's dug, spits a load of dirt out
     of his mouth and wipes his hands off.  Nearby, Bala lies
     there, bound and gagged.

                         Z
               Bala!

     Z unties Bala and undoes her gag.

                         BALA
               Z!  You came back!

     They HUG.

                         Z
               Why do they have you tied up here?

                         BALA
               There's something going on, Z --

     From here, Z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd
     is gathering.

                         BALA
               They're having a ceremony to open the
               Megatunnel...

     We can hear the sound of WATER SHIFTING somewhere above.  He
     looks up the tunnel...in the distance, we can make out the
     silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall...

                         Z
               Bala, that -- that lake we found --
               I think the tunnel's right underneath
               it!
                      (horrified)
               -- Formica's going to flood the
               colony!!!  That's what he meant when
               said there were too many ants!

                         BALA
               Oh no...

     Bala looks too shocked to move.  Z starts pushing her into
     the tunnel he made, and starts heading down towards the crowd.

                         BALA
               Z!  what are you doing?

                         Z
               I know it's crazy, but -- I can't
               just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If
               I've learned anything, it's that the
               problems of two people don't add up
               to a hill of ants in this world.  Or
               beans.  Something like that.  Anyway,
               I've got to warn the others.

     Z looks into Bala's eyes.

                         Z
               Head for the surface, Bala.  If I
               don't make it, well...we'll always
               have Insectopia.

     Z kisses Bala.  Then he starts running down the tunnel
     towards the crowd...

                         BALA
                      (following him)
               Z!!! Wait for me!

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     All the SOLDIERS are filtering out of the assembly area,
     leaving the workers behind.  As his troops march by, Formica
     steps to the side and hands the Queen a pair of scissors to
     cut the ribbon strung across the Megatunnel.

                         FORMICA
               Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of
               state keep me from attending the
               ceremony.

                         QUEEN
               But General -- this tunnel is your
               baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

                         FORMICA
               'Fraid not, your majesty.
                      (with regret)
               Goodbye, your majesty.

                         QUEEN
               Very well, General -- I know you --
               all work and no play!

                         FORMICA
               Alright, let's move out!

     Formica, surrounded by his bodyguards, hurries off as the
     Queen readies to cut the ribbon...

                         QUEEN
               In the name of the colony, I declare
               this tunnel open!

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z and Bala sprint towards the bottom end of the tunnel...

                         Z
               Stoooooop!

     -- and then pull back to see Queen cut the ribbon -- she
     looks up and sees --

                         QUEEN
               Bala!

                         BALA
               Mom!

     Z calls out to the crowd.

                         Z
               Listen up!  We've all got to get out
               of here!  This place is going to
               flood!

     The workers are unconvinced.

                         WORKER #1
               Are you nuts?

                         Z
               You've got to believe me!

                         WORKER #2
               Oh yeah?  What makes you so special,
               Mr. Know-It-All?

                         Z
               I'm Z.

     The workers are even more sceptical.  A laugh goes up from
     the crowd.

                         WORKER #3
               You're Z?  Gimme a break!  Z's ten
               milimeters tall!

                         WORKER #4
               -- and he can kill termites with his
               bare hands!  You're just some scrawny
               worker with a mental problem!

                         Z
               I am Z!

                         WORKER #1
               No you're not!

                         WEAVER
               Yes he is.

     Weaver steps out of the crowd.

                         Z
               Weaver!

     Weaver runs up to Z and hugs him, starting to cry.

                         WORKERS
               Hey...it is Z...listen to what he
               says! [etc].

                         WEAVER
               Z...I'm so sorry!  I --

                         Z
               Don't worry about it, pal.

     Nearby, Bala and the Queen hug.  The Queen looks over at Z.

                         QUEEN
                      (distastefully)
               Oh...it's that social-climbing worker
               again -- what does he want?

                         Z
                      (in response)
               To save you all!  Now we've got to go!

     AT THE TOP OF THE TUNNEL, the commando starts chiseling away
     furiously at the wall...and nothing but dust falls down.  The
     commando looks at the dust as it falls down, down the long
     tunnel...he looks up at the dry wall...Hmmm...

     Then...

     THE WALL BURSTS OPEN.

     And a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified
     commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel
     like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes...

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the

                         AZTECA
               Listen!

                         WORKER #1
               He's right!!!

     From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point
     where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing
     down at them...

                         Z
               LET'S MOVE IT!

     All of a sudden there's panic as every ant tries to scramble
     away from the oncoming water...in the confusion, the Queen's
     bearers drop her and scramble over her.

                         QUEEN
               You there!  Stop!  I say!

     The Queen turns, and for a brief moment is silhouetted
     against the white-capped torrent of water...

     ...and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high
     tails it away from the torrent, running so fast that she
     passes some of her bearers on the way...

     And then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the
     Megatunnel, quickly filling up the chamber and branching into
     all of its side tunnels, as we see:

     A group of workers RUNNING up a side tunnel and getting
     consumed by a wave, which crashes down on them like a hand
     slapping a table...

     Another group, the members of which are getting swallowed up
     one by one; one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the
     tunnel and keeps on going, upside-down...it works for a while
     but eventually he, too is swallowed up...

     -- In the Nursery, nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant
     babies...

     In one of the larger access-tunnels, down which thousands of
     workers are fleeing, a group of ants turns and decides to
     make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a
     LIVING DAM.  It holds for a while but then BURSTS scattering
     and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating
     them up...

     And we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the
     workers -- as well as Z, Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the
     Queen -- have run to.

     The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides.  Water flows
     out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crowd is
     becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters
     rise around them.

                         AZTECA
               There's no way out!

                         QUEEN
               We're all going to drown!!!

                         BALA
               Z...what can we do?

     Z clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then he
     shouts...

                         Z
               Dig!

     The workers turn to look at him questioningly.

                         Z
               We've got to dig a trench around us!

     -- But one of the workers raises his hands.

                         WORKER #1
               Uh...we don't dig any more.  We're
               individuals.

                         WORKER #2
               Yeah.  We're too important to dig.
               You taught us that, Z.  You hate
               digging!

                         Z
                      (at his wits end)
               Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now
               dig!

                         WEAVER
               You heard the ant -- DIG!!!

     The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves,
     passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the
     dry ground.

     -- But they seems to be making little headway against the
     water as it continues to rush in...

     The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to
     this.   As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and
     higher...Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...nearby,
     Azteca is digging like crazy too...Z runs around, directing
     traffic and encouraging the workers...

                         Z
               That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the
               center!  Go on!

     Nearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish.

                         Z
               Your highness...time to get your
               hands dirty!

     Gingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and
     passes it along.  Next thing you know, she's practically
     crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver.

     The water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that...

     ...the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created by
     the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher,
     reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber...

     ...And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat,
     swirling around angrily.

     Now Z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they
     can reach the top --

                         Z
               We need to form a scaffolding around
               this mound -- let's DO IT!

     The workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it,
     forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up
     towards the ceiling...

                         Z
               Now climb!

     The ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top
     of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each
     other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever
     higher towards the top...

     Where they start to dig through the very ceiling...

     ...as, at the bottom of the mound, Z starts to organize the
     hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo
     container...

                         Z
               Okay boys -- take her up!

     Z slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a
     cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those
     plastic toy monkeys...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     ...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls
     herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground,
     widening the hole...

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The water is rising...but almost all of the ants have
     escaped...Z clambers up the mound, as the scaffolding of ants
     rolls up from the bottom....

     And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of
     the structure.  As Z hauls himself through the hole in the
     ceiling.

     The entire structure collapses into the angry waters below,
     which seem furious to have missed their prey...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

                         WORKER
               He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     The "Z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in.  But the
     jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge,
     surrounding the workers, is FORMICA'S ARMY, circling the mass
     of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind
     them.  Formica himself appears in the front lines, with
     Carpenter and Mandible at his side.

                         FORMICA
               Z.  I should have known.  All that
               work, all that preparation, come to
               nothing.  All because of one stinking
               ant.

     He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers.

                         FORMICA
               ALRIGHT.  WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?

     The workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken
     circle of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?  I ASKED YOU,
               WHERE'S Z?

     Formica laughs, shaking his head.

                         FORMICA
               Folks, you may have survived that
               flood, but there's no way you're
               gonna escape from me.  I'll make you
               a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader
               Z, and you survive.

     This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.

                         FORMICA
               But if you don't hand him over,
               you're all going to die, each and
               every single..."individual" one of
               you.

     The workers all look at each other.

                         FORMICA
               What shall it be, workers?

     The workers remain frightened but silent.  Z trembles,
     terrified.

                         FORMICA
               Have it your way.

     As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a
     lone figure steps out from the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait...

     Z stands there, shivering with fear.

                         Z
               ...I'm Z.

     For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica's
     gaze.

     Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.

                         WEAVER
               No, I'm Z.

     Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering,
     bravely risking his life for his friend.  Then, AZTECA also
     steps forward.

                         AZTECA
               I'm Z!

     Next, Bala comes forward.

                         BALA
               No, I'm Z.

     More and more ants step forward.

                         WORKERS
               I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my
               brother!  I've been Z for weeks now!

                         QUEEN
                      (regally)
               We are Z.

     Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration.

                         ALL
               I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z!

     Z is plainly flabbergasted.  Formica is outraged.  He gives
     the signal.

                         FORMICA
               ATTACK!

     The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers
     towards the swirling water.  Some workers surround the Queen
     to protect her.  All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia
     alights on the rim of the horizon.

                         FLY
               Hey, guys!

     THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.

                         WASP
               It's them!

     Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the
     ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford
     film.  Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the
     unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has
     turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all
     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and
     now surround the army, dwarfing them.

                         WASP
               Are these hooligans giving you
               trouble, Z?

                         FLY
               Say the word, Z, and we kick their
               butts.

     The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.
     Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be
     bulging out of his face.

                         FORMICA
               What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!
                      (berating his army)
               Come on, you yellow-bellies!
                      (turning on Carpenter)
               Don't just stand there, Carpenter!
               Make an example of yourself!

                         CARPENTER
               Uh, actually, we are outnumbered
               sir...

     Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him.  With
     his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and
     CHARGES Z!

                         FORMICA
               AHHHHHHH!!

     Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet
     blows off his head.  Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,
     slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the
     whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and
     then tumbles over.

     For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.

                         FORMICA (O.S.)
               Help...help me...

     Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica
     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,
     which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes,
     a new expression crossing his features: fear.

                         FORMICA
               Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...

     Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --
     but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...

     Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on
     him.

                         Z
               I thought you said that the life of
               one ant doesn't matter.

     Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to
     realize his error...

                         FORMICA
               I guess it does...to the ant.

     Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z
     and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a
     nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).

     Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while
     HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala fights
     her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then the
     ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.

     Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica,
     carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the best
     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen
     general.

                         CARPENTER
               Sir, if it's any consolation, I still
               think you're completely worthless as
               an individual.

                                              FADE TO:

     CLOSE UP OF Z

     As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.

                         Z
               So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just
               your basic "simple worker overthrows
               the government and winds up with the
               princess" kind of a story.
               You know: there was the big parade
               and everything...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a medal by
     the Queen.

                                              CUT TO:

     GENERAL FORMICA'S FACE, looking extremely dispeptic.

                         Z (V.O.)
               General Formica was almost
               unemployable.  He eventually got a
               gig as a honeydew keg.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall, his belly
     hideously distended with honeydew.

                         Z (V.O.)
               The Queen asked me to take over his
               job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm
               really not the general type.  I'm
               more the specific type."  So they
               gave the job to Weaver instead.

                                              CUT TO:

     WEAVER, in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his
     feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar.  Carpenter is on
     his hands and knees scrubbing the floor.

                         Z (V.O.)
               Weaver cut the defense budget in
               half.  Now we only have an army of
               five million.

     cut back to

     Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE.

                         Z
               And me, I guess you could say that I
               lived happily ever after.

     Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him.

                         Z
               I mean, I've got the whole package,
               right?  A great life, a beautiful
               wife, and a few kids.

                         BALA
               A few?

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY

     Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to
     their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS.  The children cover
     every horizontal surface.  They run around, cry, laugh, and
     tease each other.  Z looks around the room, looks back at us,
     and shrugs.

                         Z
               Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you
               know?  I wouldn't change a thing.

     The camera pulls up...and away from the ground...to reveal
     that this whole story has been taking place in a small area
     of CENTRAL PARK.  We pull back and back, and see all the
     familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the
     drinking fountain, etc.  We tilt up into the NEW YORK
     SKYLINE.  BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH.

     FADE OUT.

     THE END

                         Z (O.S.)
                      (over a dark screen)
               All my life, I've lived and worked in
               the big city...

     We see:

     EXT. AN ANT MOUND - DAY

     The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside,
     past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the
     gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access
     tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants
     plodding along...

     ...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming
     vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants
     rushing here and there on their business.  We see -- a
     "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like
     crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants
     marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down
     a matchbox elevator filled with workers.

                         Z (V.O.)
               ...which is kind of a problem, since
               I've always felt uncomfortably in
               crowds.

     INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     We join Z, a worker ant with issues.  He's lying on a couch,
     recounting his woes.

                         Z
               I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've
               got abandonment issues.  My father
               flew away when I was just a larva.
               My mother didn't have much time for
               me...when you have five million
               siblings, it's difficult to get
               attention.
                      (pause)
               I feel physically inadequate -- I've
               never been able to lift more than ten
               times my own weight.  Sometimes I
               think I'm just not cut out to be a
               worker.  But I don't have any other
               options.  I was assigned to trade
               school when I was just a grub.  The
               whole system just...makes me
               feel...insignificant.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (enthusiastic)
               Terrific!  You should feel
               insignificant!

     For the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR.
     He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the
     hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of "Ronco").

                         Z
               ...I should?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (hopping around
                       enthusiastically)
               YES!!!  You know, people ask me,
               "Doctor, why are you always happy?"
               And I tell them it's mind over
               matter.  I don't mind that I don't
               matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get
               it?

     Z gives a fake smile.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
                      (incredibly "up")
               Z, we're part of the fastest growing
               species in the whole world!

     The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall.  An arrow
     shows ant population going up, up, up.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Ask me why we're so successful.

                         Z
               Why are we so successful?

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               I'm glad you asked me that question!

     The motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a
     vista of the ant-filled chamber below.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               What do you see out there?

                         Z
               ...Ants...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures,
               each with his assigned task, all
               pulling together!

     Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an
     incline.  One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down,
     crushing his leg.  The other ants rush over -- it looks like
     they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they
     climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing
     with their task.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               You see?  Being an ant is being able
               to say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless,
               you're meaningless."

                         Z
               But -- but I've always felt life was
               about finding meaning...and then
               sharing it with someone special,
               someone you love.

     The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he
     seems to understand...

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Z...you need help.
                      (looking at a clock)
               Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop
               there.  Your minute is up!

     The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.

                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
               Now back to work!  We've made real
               progress!  Remember -- let's be
               best superorganism we can be!

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel".
     A banner strung overhead reads: "The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling
     Our Way to a Bright Future!"  Along the walls hang 50's work-
     incentive style posters with messages like, "You asked for
     it, you got it -- more work!" and "TWO MEALS A WEEK IS
     ENOUGH!!!"  Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel,
     digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone
     synchronized.

     CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand.
     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands
     there, waiting to pass the dirt on.  Z is daydreaming behind
     her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.

                         AZTECA
               Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap
               out of it, or there's gonna be a lot
               of pissed off ants!

     Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.

                         Z
                      (snapping out of it)
               Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas!
               Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!
                      (looking at the dirt)
               Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I
               mean this dirt is very...dirty.
               Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?
                      (Z's stomach growls)
               Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm
               seeing double.  It looks like there's
               two million ants in here.  When's
               lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?

                         AZTECA
                      (sweetly)
               Z, old pal...
                      (shouts)
               SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's
               a food shortage without you
               complaining about it every day.

                         Z
               The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

                         AZTECA
               No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets thrown
               away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z,
               even though you are a pain in my rear-
               segment.  I don't wanna see
               anything happen to you.  So quit
               mouthing off, before you get in
               trouble.

     A WHISTLE BLOWS.

                         Z
               Thank goodness.  Breaktime.

     All the ants put down their tools.  A beat.  Then the WHISTLE
     BLOWS AGAIN.  All the ants pick up their tools again.

                         AZTECA
                      (resigned)
               Break's over.

                         Z
                      (getting back to work)
               This colony needs another tunnel like
               a hole in the ground.  Why are we
               even digging this thing?

                         AZTECA
               Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we
               gotta dig.  We're not the ones in
               charge.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony.  Looming over
     the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be
     inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.

     Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters,
     seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants
     in the place?

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               STAIRS!

     The workers look up and GROAN.  Then they start forming a
     stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on
     each other's shoulders.  It's extremely unpleasant work.  One
     ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place
     before...

     GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the
     colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he
     ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow.  As
     Formica mounts the "stairs"  we can hear the workers going,
     "OUCH!  OOF!  YIKES!" etc.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               Cut the chit-chat down there!
                      (turning to Carpenter)
               We've spoiled these workers,
               Carpenter.  They've never had it so
               good, and listen to them -- always
               grumbling and complaining...

     Formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who
     muffles a yelp.

                         CARPENTER
               ...Yes, sir.

                         GENERAL FORMICA
               What have they got to complain about?
               Three square meals a day...

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we've cut them down to
               three roughly rectangular meals a
               week.

                         FORMICA
               Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.
               I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!

     Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase.
     There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive
     throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge
     SQUEAKS.

                         FORMICA
                      (to guard ant, while
                       passing)
               Oil that, soldier.

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     The QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind
     her.

                         QUEEN
               Ah!  General Formica.

     Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.

     Note:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth
     repeatedly.  Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a
     short "Happy Birthday" fanfare on his trumpet.  Mid-wife ants
     bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few
     words.  The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-
     line, powered by ants on a treadmill.

                         QUEEN
               General, the severe food shortage
               that faces the colony...pains me.
               The thought of any of my children
               going hungry...
                      (she shudders; then,
                       to baby)
               Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You
               are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to
               brush your teeth!
                      (to mid-wife)
               Ship 'er out.
                      (back to Formica)
               What steps are you taking to remedy
               the situation?

                         FORMICA
               We are launching a major offensive to
               expand our foraging territory...

                         QUEEN
               Yes, what else?

                         FORMICA
               Please don't worry, your majesty.
               Leave the worrying to me.  As you
               know, I'm not an ant of half-
               measures.  I don't pussyfoot around.
               This crisis is my number one
               priority, and I promise you it's
               being dealt with swiftly, and
               decisively.

     The Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being
     put in her arms.

                         QUEEN
                      (to baby)
               No snacking between meals!  Off you
               go!
                      (to Formica)
               Now -- what were we saying?

                         FORMICA
                      (Oliver North-style)
               I do not recollect, your majesty.
               Will that be all?

                         QUEEN
               Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my
               good man!  I don't know what we would
               do without you.

     Formica clicks his heels and bows his head.  Carpenter bows
     low.  Formica smartly about faces --

                         BALA (O.S.)
               General Formica!

     PRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway, carrying a
     swatch book.  Something about her sets her apart from the
     HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her.  Her tiara, probably.

     Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him.

                         CARPENTER
                      (sotto)
               Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.

                         FORMICA
               Princess!  You look -- outstanding.
               Is there anything I can do for you?

                         BALA
               Well -- I thought -- since we're
               getting married...it might be nice if
               we...got to know one another.

     Formica looks confused.

                         QUEEN
               Bala has always been a hopeless
               romantic, General.

                         BALA
               It's just that -- well, I'm honored
               that you selected me, and everything,
               I just thought the marriage might go
               a little more smoothly if -- we had
               a conversation?

                         FORMICA
                      (uncomfortable)
               Conversation...yes...well...
                      (to Carpenter)
               Wasn't she briefed?

                         QUEEN
                      (holding up a baby)
               Look, General!  A darling baby
               soldier!
                      (emotionally, to baby)
               Don't try to be a hero!  Just make
               sure you come back in one piece!
                      (handing it off)
               Next!

                         FORMICA
                      (using the
                       interruption)
               I'll take your suggestion under
               advisement, Princess.  In the
               meanwhile --

     Formica turns to go.

                         BALA
               General -- we have to talk sometime!

                         FORMICA
               Very well.  Carpenter, is there a
               convenient time to talk vis-a-vis:
               relationship?

                         CARPENTER
               Actually, sir, we're ahead of
               schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds
               available right now.

                         FORMICA
               Outstanding.  Princess...?

     Bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.

                         BALA
               So, um...how was your day?  What did
               you do?

                         FORMICA
                      (scouring his mind)
               Well...
                      (that's it!)
               I declared war!

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing
               in common...

                         CARPENTER
                      (under his breath)
               Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Duty calls!

     He strides across the floor.  Bala watches him go, her
     antennae drooping unhappily.

                         FORMICA
               No squeak.  Outstanding!

     We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as
     Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame.

     The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy.

                         QUEEN
                      (sympathetically)
               I felt the same way before I got
               married.  Confused.  Scared.

                         BALA
                      (hopefully)
               You did?

                         QUEEN
               Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted
               out all those messy feelings.  The
               wonderful thing about ant life is
               that everything is arranged.  Even
               marriage.  You're lucky -- General
               Formica is a paragon of anthood.

                         BALA
                      (unconvinced)
               Yes...he's wonderful...

     The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants
     who were CRUSHED in the wake of Formica's exit.

     INT. BALA'S QUARTERS - DAY

     Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state
     of giggling infatuation over Formica.  Bala is scowling as
     she leafs through a wedding catalogue.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
                      (swooning over
                       General Formica)
               The General's body segments are
               so...symmetrical.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (giggling)
               I'd let him order me into battle
               anyday.

     Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess?  What's wrong?

                         BALA
               Wrong?  How could anything be wrong?
               I'm going to marry General Formica
               and be a queen and have millions of
               babies, just like my mom.
                      (concerned)
               Do I look fat to you?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
                      (knowingly, to
                       Handmaiden #2)
               Pre-wedding jitters.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               You just need to blow off some steam.
               Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!

                         BALA
               The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try
               someplace different.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               There isn't anyplace else --
                      (making a joke)
               Except the worker bar.

                         BALA
               The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where
               I want to go!

     The handmaidens look shocked.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But -- we can't -- there'll be
               workers there.

     INT. ANT BAR - NIGHT

     A long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch
     for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a
     drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at
     the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.

                         Z
               We declared war again?
                      (off Weaver's nod)
               Are you scared?

                         WEAVER
                      (shrugs)
               I'll be back.

     The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like
     a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids,
     little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs
     hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with
     hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.

                         APHIDS
                      (as they're slapped
                       on bar)
               Ouch!  Ouch!

                         BARTENDER
               Two aphid beers.

                         Z
                      (as Bartender leaves)
               Did you see that?  How he gave you
               the beers, not me?  I'm telling you,
               he's got something against workers.

                         WEAVER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about, Z.

                         Z
               Come on -- everybody dumps on us
               workers.  You soldiers get all the
               glory.  Plus you get to go out into
               the world, meet interesting insects,
               and kill them.

                         WEAVER
               Yeah, but you get to spend all day
               with those fabulous worker babes.

     We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "Worker
     Babes", including Z's friend Azteca.

                         Z
               Weaver, they're career girls.
               They're obsessed with digging.
                      (sighs)
               No, I'll probably never meet the girl
               for me.

                         WEAVER
               Who said there was a girl for you?
               I was talking about a girl for me.
                      (quaffing his aphid
                       beer)
               Don't you want your aphid beer?

                         Z
               I can't help it.  I have a thing
               about drinking from the anus of
               another creature.  Call me crazy.

                         WEAVER
               Z, we've known each other a long
               time, right?

                         Z
               Of course.  You were born two seconds
               after me.

                         WEAVER
               And all the time I've known you,
               you've been grumping and groaning.
               You should quit making waves.  Go
               with the flow.

                         Z
               Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.

     Down the bar, there's a commotion.  A grizzled old SCOUT ant
     has had too much to drink.

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               Have you been to Insectopia?  Have
               you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I
               have...
                      (becoming emotional)
               ...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n'
               beetles -- all livin' in peace,
               stuffin their guts with food...No
               rules, no regulations...you can be
               your own ant there...
                      (howling drunkenly)
               It's Insectopia!  Insectopia!

                         Z
               Hey, Weaver, listen!

                         DRUNK SCOUT
               I was cut off from my unit -- found
               it by mistake --
                      (slurring)
               It changed my life!
                      (spraying another
                       soldier with saliva)
               You see -- ya follow the great yellow
               egg, and you come to the land of red
               and white --

                         SOLDIERS
               You've had enough for one night!
               Come on, Gramps, before you get in
               trouble.

     The soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Hey, did you hear what he said?!

                         WEAVER
               Poor guy's had one too many scouting
               missions.

     MUSIC STARTS UP.

     INT. ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar,
     accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               We shouldn't be doing this -- it
               isn't proper!

                         BALA
               I'm the Princess, aren't I?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course --

                         BALA
               And do Princesses do improper things?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               Of course not --

                         BALA
               Then if I go to the worker bar, it
               isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry.
               No one will recognize us in our
               disguises.

     She adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.-
     style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf.

                         BALA
               I'm just a common worker, cooling off
               after a rough day!

     Music starts.  An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the
     dance floor.

                         BARKER
                      (on loudspeaker)
               Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and
               that means it's time to dance.

     Every ant gets up to dance.  Weaver turns to Z.

                         WEAVER
                      (draining his beer)
               Time to cut a rug, Z!

                         Z
               I'm not in the mood.
                      (disgusted)
               Even when they're off work, they
               follow orders.

                         WEAVER
               Well, you just sit here and be a
               party-pooper.

     Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the
     dance.  The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone --
     all the ants already know the steps.  Everyone dances in
     perfect synch.

                         BARKER
                      (southern twang)
               And a left-right-quarterstep-back
               step-halfstep -- a left-right-
               quarterstep-backstep-halfstep --
               a left-right-quarterstep-backstep
               halfstep --

     AT THE ENTRANCE, Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.

                         BALA
               I'm going to ask one of these
               mindless, primitive worker-types to
               dance with me!

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               But General Formica would be furious!

                         BALA
                      (enjoying the idea)
               I know.

     The handmaidens are appalled.  Bala whirls away from them,
     sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on --

     Z, who's watching the other ants dance.

                         Z
               What a bunch of losers.  Mindless
               zombies capitulating to an oppressive
               system --

                         BALA
               Wanna dance?

     Bala's standing right there.  Z is instantly smitten.

                         Z
               Me?!  Yes!!!  I mean --
                      (regaining suavosity)
               Just let me finish my beer.

     Not breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely.
     Reaches suavely for a beer.  Suavely grabs the candle in a
     glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face.

     He plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit
     apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her.

                         Z
               So uh -- how come I haven't seen you
               around here before?

                         BALA
                      (covering up)
               I work in the palace, I don't get out
               much.

                         Z
               The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals
               really live it up.  Of course they're
               all a little, you know, from
               inbreeding --

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               What?

     Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the
     ants, but Z can't do any of the steps.

                         Z
               Now, let's see, I -- it's been a
               while since I -- I think you --

     Bala watches Z, trying to follow along.  It's the blind
     leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's
     rapid instructions.

                         Z
               Here, I'll lead.

     Z starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave
     expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter
     mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.

                         BALA
               Are you sure this is a real dance?

                         Z
               Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of
               making it up --

                         BALA
                      (surprised)
               Really?

                         Z
               Why should everyone dance the same
               way?  It's as exciting as watching
               fungus grow.

                         BALA
               You're right!

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You -- you think I'm right?

                         BALA
               Why can't I just do whatever I want
               to do?  Why can't I just go wild?!
               Yahoo!

     Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply
     to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of
     them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too
     wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their
     intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost
     knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's
     back at the moment.

                         SOLDIER
               Hey!  Watch your step, worker.

     Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE,
     glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got
     one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed
     off.

                         BALA
               You watch yours, soldier, or my
               worker friend will beat you up!

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off
               this time.
                      (whispering to Bala)
               Are you crazy?  This guy's built like
               a pebble!
                      (ineptly trying to
                       placate the soldier)
               You know they do great prosthetic
               antennas nowadays --

                         BALA
               Aren't you gonna stand up for
               yourself?

     Z's caught between a rock and a hard place.  He doesn't want
     to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to
     lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered
     around, looking hostile.

                         SOLDIER
               How come you don't dance like the
               rest of us?

     Z glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he
     says defiantly...

                         Z
               Because -- because I'm an individual!

                         SOLDIER #2
               An individual?  Never heard of it.

                         MANDIBLE
               You look like a worker to me.

                         WEAVER
               Hey, lay off my little buddy!

     Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just
     realized something very important.  Unfortunately, just at
     this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him
     back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it,
     there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the
     middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the
     face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess'
     handmaidens hurries over.

                         HANDMAIDEN #1
               Princess Bala!  Princess Bala!

     Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.

                         Z
               Princess?  You're a Princess?

                         HANDMAIDEN #2
               The police are coming!

                         BALA
               Uh oh.
                      (to Z)
               Goodbye!  Gotta run!

                         Z
               Wait!  When can I see you again?

                         BALA
               Let me think.  Hmmnn...
                      (thinks)
               Never.  Bye!

     Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of
     whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait!  Princess!  Wait!

     But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY

     Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.
     Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.

                         WEAVER
               Get real, Z!  She just dropped the
               scarf by accident!

                         Z
               Are you kidding?  There were sparks
               between us!  This scarf is a sign!

                         WEAVER
               It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do
               you know what the penalty for
               impersonating a soldier is?

                         Z
               What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your
               place for the royal inspection.  Bala
               comes strolling down the line, she
               sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled,
               and she takes me up to the palace for
               a little...
                      (wags his eyebrows
                       suggestively)
               tea and crumpets... and you take your
               place again, and go march around to
               your heart's content!

     Weaver looks unconvinced.

                         Z
               You have to help me.  Please, Weaver.
               Think of all the things I've done for
               you!

                         WEAVER
                      (thinks)
               I can't think of any.

                         Z
                      (pause)
               Well I'm gonna start doing things for
               you...

                         WEAVER
               Will you introduce me to some worker
               girls?

                         Z
               You bet!  They'll really go for a
               sensitive guy like you!

                         WEAVER
               Maybe I'll get lucky.
                      (Weaver thinks about
                       it)
               You know, Z, I wouldn't do this
               for anyone but you...

     Weaver hands Z has helmet.

                         WEAVER
               Wear this.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               You're a real buddy.

                         WEAVER
                      (sourly)
               Yeah, I know.

                         Z
               What do I do?

                         WEAVER
               Don't tell anyone you're a worker.
               Follow that column over there.  And
               come right back after the inspection!

     Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation.

                         Z
                      (overjoyed)
               Thanks!  I owe you!

     Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the
     soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.

     INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT

     The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a
     reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of
     soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant
     General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads,
     "GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey".

     Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.

                         Z
               Any of you guys know when the
               Princess will show up?  She's kind of
               a personal friend.

     The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.

                         LOUD VOICE
               ATTEN-SHUN!

     MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as
     they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.

     GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping
     his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some
     unfortunate insect)

                         FORMICA
               First of all, let me make one thing
               clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by
               thinking for himself.  All this
               "thinking" stuff is a load of crap.
               If the almighty had wanted you boys
               to think, he wouldn't have given you
               huge mandibles and a brain so small
               you'd misplace it if it wasn't
               trapped inside your head.

     In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's
     just made a joke.

                         Z
                      (slapping his thigh)
               "Trapped inside your head" -- that's
               a good one --

     Z notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops.

                         Z
               Geez -- tough room.

     From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying
     to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many
     ants.  He continues.

                         FORMICA
                      (striding back and
                       forth)
               We ants survive as a species because
               we do what we're told.  We survive
               because we work together, as one, we
               get the job done, we do whatever it
               takes to persevere!
                      (dramatic pause)
               Hell, we're not an army of
               ants...we're one giant ant, with
               giant fists, and giant jaws!

     The soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.

                         Z
                      (to the soldier ant
                       next to him)
               Lays it on a little thick, doesn't
               he?  If you ask me, he's one giant
               bore.

                         FORMICA
               Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt
               about a food shortage.  Well you boys
               are gonna be taken care of.  But in
               the meantime we're gonna eat the
               enemy for breakfast, we are gonna
               eat the enemy for lunch, and we are
               gonna eat the enemy for dinner!

                         Z
               Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.

                         FORMICA
                      (reflective moment)
               Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.
                      (he looks out at his
                       army)
               And I know each and every one of you
               boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.

     Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in
     confusion.

                         Z
                      (clapping)
               Bravo!  Bring on the Princess!

                         COLONEL
               Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's
               move 'em out!

     The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past
     the reviewing stand.

     A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around
     for the Princess.

                         COLONEL
               Eyes...left!

     Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the
     reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next
     to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.

                         Z
                      (waving)
               Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's
               me!  Z!  I've got your scarf!

     ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she
     sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching
     by...

                         BALA
                      (peering out)
               Who is that idiot?

                         QUEEN
               Darling, you must encourage the
               troops -- wave!

     Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her
     hand back and forth on her wrist.

     Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him.

                         Z
                      (excited)
               Excuse me, guys -- That's my date.
               Well, it's been fun.  Have a great
               war!

     Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's
     surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're
     carrying him along with them.

                         Z
               Hey!  Wait!

     Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away.
     BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps Z on the
     shoulder.

                         BARBATUS
               You new, kid?

                         Z
               I just joined up.  But I'm quitting!
               I got a trial membership!

                         BARBATUS
               Trial membership?  Kid, when you join
               this ant's army, you're in for the
               full hitch.

     At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor
     they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the
     OPEN AIR outside of the colony.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT

     It's a starry, moonlit night.  The shadows crowd around the
     panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the
     march...

                         Z
               Wait a minute, there's been a
               mistake!  I've got to get back to the
               colony!

     Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking
     concerned, stops him.

                         BARBATUS
               Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot
               deserters!

     Z swallows hard.

                         BARBATUS
               You just stick by old Barbatus.
               He'll watch out for you.
                      (off Z's look)
               Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl
               behind?

                         Z
               Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of
               playing hard to get.  As a matter of
               fact, she's playing completely
               unattainable.
                      (nervously)
               So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk
               walk?  a foraging expedition?

                         BARBATUS
               No -- we're going to attack the
               termites!

                         Z
                      (alarmed)
               Attack?  But -- I hate attacking!
               It's so hostile!

     Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song,
     which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to
     form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the
     termite capital.

                         ANT SOLDIERS
                      (to the tune of "When
                       Johnny Comes
                       Marching Home")
               We ants go marching one by
               one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter
               termites just for fun, Hurrah!
               Hurrah!

                         Z
               So -- these termites, they're little,
               shy, retiring insects?

                         BARBATUS
                      (grim smile)
               No such luck.  Those dirty terms are
               five times bigger than us, and they
               shoot acid from their foreheads!

                         SOLDIER ANTS
               We ants go marching two by two,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead
               before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the
     screen, fading into another column marching diagonally
     downwards across the screen...

                         Z
               Well, what exactly does our platoon
               do?  Serve beverages?  Process
               paperwork?

                         BARBATUS
               Our platoon has the best assignment
               of all.  We're the first into battle!

                         ANT SOLDIERS
               We ants are marching three by three,
               hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what
               we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah!

     ...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of
     living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as
     they're getting stepped on...

                         Z
               So we're going back for more armor,
               right?  I mean, these guys are from
               outer space, how are we supposed to
               beat them?!

                         BARBATUS
               Superior numbers, kid!

     EXT. TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT

     Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE
     CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here
     it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts
     an order.

                         COLONEL
               ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!

     The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite
     colony...Z is swept along...

                         BARBATUS
               Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!

     Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
     ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.
     Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very
     middle of the termite colony...

     Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle
     of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but
     there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around
     suspiciously.

                         BARBATUS
               It's too damn quiet.

     Then we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over,
     and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.

                         BARBATUS
               Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's
               got yer back.

                         Z
                      (petrified)
               Maybe they went out for the evening.
               Let's leave them a message and head
               home.

                         COLONEL
                      (ignoring him)
               Light it up!

     A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and
     pinches him.  The firefly, yelling "Yipe!  Yipe!  Yipe!",
     shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of
     the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.

     Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like
     innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the
     stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of
     hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the
     tree, right onto the ant army.

                         COLONEL
               They're here!!!

                         BARBATUS
                      (to Z)
               Keep your head down!

     Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a
     BLOODBATH.  The ants have broken into the colony, but are
     taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing
     termites.  The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as
     something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's
     perspective, we see:

     -- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are
     literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid
     from its forehead...

     -- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is
     pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...

     -- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one
     and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...

                         Z
                      (looking around)
               Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for
               all of us to just talk this over!

     Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to
     face Z.  Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling
     monstrosity.

                         Z
               Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come
               out in spots!  -- Could I just say I
               have always had the greatest respect
               for your species?  I mean, eating
               wood -- why didn't I think of that?
               I --

     The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's
     knocked backwards by...

                         Z
               BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't get all sappy about it!

     As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the
     Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar.

                         COLONEL
               I love the smell of formic acid in
               the morning.

                         Z
               Look out!

     A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly
     burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's
     paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites
     rumbling towards them.  Z, terrified, dives into the hole
     that the huge termite made...

     INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     ...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound.
     The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with
     jagged access holes.

     No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes
     burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's
     head.  Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight
     through the wall in order to escape...

     INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

     ...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the
     Queen's chamber.  This is nothing like the civilized court of
     the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose
     walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled
     stones.

     The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long
     monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite
     nurses.  The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.

                         Z
               Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I
               was wondering if you could give me --

     Before Z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a
     piercing, blood-curdling shriek.  The nurses start shrieking
     too.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               I'll let myself out.

     But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the
     biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z,
     jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.

                         Z
                      (backing away)
               Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro!

     At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite
     runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber.  As
     if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and
     shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin
     to rumble...

     The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone
     falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and
     collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.

     As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and
     termites pour into the room from the corridors around and
     above...they keep struggling until...

                         ANT OFFICER
                      (points at Z)
               He's killed their Queen!

                         Z
               Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --

                         ANT OFFICER
               VICTORY!!!

     We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their
     leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey
     for the ants.

                         Z
                      (facetious)
               This is terrific!   Let's exact
               crippling war reparations!  Let's set
               up a puppet government!

                         ANT OFFICER
               Let's slaughter them all!

     The ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we
     hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look
     up confusedly...

     ...And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot
     long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a
     CRASH.  The ten or so ants standing directly below are
     smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva
     around the crater.  As quick as it appeared, the tongue
     retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound.  We can now see
     the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in
     the ceiling high above...

                         ANT OFFICER
               INCOMING!

     The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose
     bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but
     to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and
     again...

     Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down
     again, barely missing him!

     Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him,
     across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting
     closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants
     and struggling termites...

     ....Then the tongue disappears.  Silence.  Z wipes his brow...

     And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater
     searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down
     the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it
     ricochets along the walls!

     Z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him,
     reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana
     Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark!  The walls disintegrate
     under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to
     Z...closer...

     ...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down
     to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form
     of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final
     contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.

     EXT. TERMITE STUMP - MORNING

     Z makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an
     expression of horror on his face.

                         BARBATUS (O.S.)
               Z!  Over here!

                         Z
                      (hopeful)
               Barbatus?

     Z looks down at his feet, where Barbatus's still-living,
     decapitated head is looking up at him.

                         Z
                      (shocked)
               Barbatus!

                         BARBATUS
               Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?

                         Z
               No, no, you're...lookin' good.
               You've got good color in your cheeks.

                         BARBATUS
               No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm
               a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this
               ant's army, a soldier's life ain't
               worth a sack of fungus.
                      (he winces)
               I can't feel my legs...

                         Z
               Hang in there, buddy!  You can make
               it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll
               try and find your body -- it's gotta
               be around here somewhere!

                         BARBATUS
                      (gasping)
               I wonder...what...was it all...for...

                         Z
               Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!

                         BARBATUS
               Don't make my mistake, kid...
               don't...be a grunt...your whole
               life...

     Barbatus dies, leaving Z heartbroken.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Weaver is "passing" as a worker, working alongside much
     smaller worker ants.  He actually loves the work.  He's
     throwing up dirt like a bulldozer.  He's so enthusiastic, he
     scoops up a WHOLE ANT in his shovel and tosses him aside.
     Azteca, who's standing next to him in line, is shocked by,
     and a little attracted to, this turbo-worker.

                         AZTECA
               Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're
               making the rest of us look bad...How
               come I haven't seen you around here
               before?

                         WEAVER
                      (covering)
               I'm new...I was born yesterday.

                         AZTECA
               Tell me about it.

                         WEAVER
               Nobody told me digging was so much
               fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move
               it, you pick it up again, you move it
               again -- lots of repetitions, you
               exercise the forceps, and the
               pincers --

                         AZTECA
                      (ogling him)
               Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...

     While Azteca is checking out the hunky new worker, work has
     effectively stopped...clods are piling up behind Weaver.  A
     Foreman comes striding down the line, furious.

                         FOREMAN
               What's the holdup here?!

     Weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes, as if
     he's dealing with a superior officer.

                         WEAVER
               Sorry, sir -- I was just having a
               little chat with my friend --

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at Weaver)
               Who said you could have a chat?
               You're not a chatter, you're a
               digger!  So shut up and dig!

                         AZTECA
               Leave him alone!  He's new.

                         FOREMAN
               You  too?  Well just for that, you
               lose your day's rations!  Now get
               back to work!

     The Foreman heads down the line, shoving and berating the
     other workers as he goes along.

                         AZTECA
                      (surprised at herself)
               I don't know what came over me,
               talking back like that.  I must be
               going crazy...

                         WEAVER
               Sorry I got you in trouble.  But
               listen, you can share my rations.

                         AZTECA
                      (flirting)
               Are you asking me out to dinner?

                         WEAVER
                      (blushing)
               No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you
               don't have other plans.

                         AZTECA
               I'll make myself available...Listen,
               better watch out with the
               backtalk.  I don't know want you to
               end up like the guy who used to work
               next to me.  I'm afraid he got...
               downsized.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main
     entrance to the hive.

                         GUARD ANT
               Look!  They're back!  The army's
               back!  Alert the colony!

     The other ant starts ringing a bell, rushing down into the
     colony.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A huge crowd is forming, eager to welcome the army back.  A
     band is striking up a triumphant victory song, confetti and
     streamers are being thrown, as General Formica strides in,
     followed by Carpenter.

                         EXCITED ANTS
               The army's returned!  Our brave boys
               are back! (etc.)

     Everyone waves little flags as the tuba player Oompah-oompah-
     oompahs...

     ...and Z walks into the hall, looking bedraggled and
     exhausted, his helmet hanging over his ears.

     The band slows to a halt.

     At the edge of the crowd, Azteca, sitting on Weaver's
     shoulders, can just about see over the crowd.

                         AZTECA
               It looks like only one soldier made
               it back!

     Weaver looks distraught.

                         WEAVER
                      (to himself)
               Poor Z -- I should never have let you
               go!

     Far down the hall, Z is describing the battle.

                         Z
               It was horrible...a massacre, a
               massacre upon a massacre.  First we
               massacred them, then they massacred
               us, then it was halftime.  I've never
               seen such violence, such
               bloodthirstiness, such bad
               manners...I'm the only one that made
               it!

     The atmosphere is somber.  This is a tough one to try and put
     a spin on...but that doesn't stop Formica from trying.

                         FORMICA
               ONE TO NOTHING!  WE WIN!

     The band strikes up again, and everyone cheers.

                         Z
               No -- you -- you don't understand!

                         FORMICA
               Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish
               I had a hundred ants of your caliber.
               The world would tremble.  Now, time
               for some R and R.  You're invited to
               the royal victory party!

                         Z
               Royal victory party?  Will...will
               Princess Bala be there?

                         FORMICA
               Of course.  The entire royal family
               will be there to honor you.

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               ONE TO NOTHING!

     Renewed CHEERS, as Z is lifted onto the shoulder of some of
     the soldiers who stayed behind.

                         AZTECA
               Wait a minute, that's no soldier --
               that's Z!

                         WEAVER
               Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it!

     Z is following Formica away from the cheering crowd.

     EXT. ABOVE TOWN CENTER - DAY

     Z and Formica are going up the royal "stairway" together.

                         FORMICA
               Son, you're an ant after my own
               heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks
               death right in the face and laughs.

                         Z
               Well, I generally just make
               belittling comments and snicker
               behind death's back.  So, tell me,
               fellow war-monger...do you think
               Princess Bala likes men in uniform?

                         FORMICA
               Well she better -- she's engaged to
               one.  Me!

                         Z
               Engaged?  As in you're getting
               married?

                         FORMICA
               Affirmative.

                         Z
               So...you two are in love?

                         FORMICA
               In love?
                      (shakes his head)
               I'm just a plain old soldier at
               heart.  I'll tell you what I love --
               the field -- blood -- death --
               orders...and the company of other
               warriors.

     Formica gives Z a manly slap on the back.  Z looks a little
     uncomfortable as we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Z follows Formica and Carpenter into the throne room.  At the
     end of the hall, a society band is playing.  The room is full
     of courtier ants and officers.

     Waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors d'ouevres.

                         Z
               Wow, what a spread -- you know,
               there's a food shortage in the rest
               of the colony.

                         FORMICA
               Yes, and do you know why there's a
               food shortage?

                         Z
               ...Not enough food?

                         FORMICA
               Negatory.  Too many ants.  And while
               we soldiers go out there, and fight,
               and bleed, and die for the colony,
               the namby-pamby workers live it up
               back home.

     Feeling a little hot, Z wipes his brow.

                         Z
               Well I, I don't think "living it up"
               is the right term -- how about
               "working themselves to death"?

                         FORMICA
               I tell you son, sometimes, at night,
               I see myself in battle, fighting a
               horrible, faceless enemy, with the
               future of our whole species at stake.
               And always, the dream ends with each
               of us plunging his sword into the
               other's heart...

                         Z
                      (spooked)
               Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see
               an old war buddy over there, it's
               been fun chatting.  Good luck with
               the hallucinations.

     Z escapes from Formica, who gazes after him suspiciously.

     Z mingles in with the crowd, then he sees Princess Bala
     standing with a group of officers who are eating hors
     d'oeuvres.

                         OFFICER
                      (telling a joke)
               What do you call it when 10,000
               workers are killed in a tunnel cave-
               in?
                      (a beat)
               Who cares?  They're workers!

     The officers laugh, but Bala looks bored in this stuffy
     social scene.

                         Z
               But...don't you think the worker
               class is the very foundation of the
               colony --
                      (realizes he's
                       getting odd looks)
               I mean, uh, without them, who would
               we stand on?

     More laughter.

                         BALA
               You're the hero of the recent termite
               campaign, aren't you?

                         Z
               Well, if single-handedly vanquishing
               the enemy and slaughtering a whole
               nestful of termites makes someone a
               hero, yes I am.

     Z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by,
     and KNOCKS the whole thing CLATTERING to the ground.

                         Z
                      (feigning nonchalance)
               And you are...?

                         BALA
               I'm Princess Bala.

                         Z
               Ah, yes.
                      (affected)
               Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So,
               Princess, have you ever danced with
               a hero?

                         BALA
               Yes.

                         Z
                      (deflated)
               Oh...oh well then, one more won't
               matter.

     She moves towards the dance floor.  Z spit-combs his
     antennae, struts after her -- until he trips on his sword.
     He tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as Bala turns
     toward him, turning it into a ballet plies.

                         Z
               Just warming up...

     She frowns...there's something familiar about this guy.  But
     then they start dancing.

     ACROSS THE ROOM: The Queen and General Formica watch the
     party.

                         QUEEN
               All these parties are so marvellously
               alike.

                         FORMICA
               They should be...
                      (suspicious)
               But there's something funny about
               that soldier.

     Formica strides over to where Z and Bala are dancing.

                         FORMICA
                      (glowering)
               May I cut in?

                         Z
                      (intimidated)
               Oh, of course --

                         BALA
                      (pulling Z back)
               No, General.  I'm dancing with the
               war hero.

                         Z
                      (trying to placate
                       Formica)
               Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always
               had this animal magnetism, it --

     Bala YANKS Z back onto the dance floor, dancing away from
     Formica.

                         BALA
               You dance...

                         Z
               Divinely?

                         BALA
               No weirdly...You remind me of
               someone...

     Formica catches Bala's eye.  She frowns at him, and decides
     to get a little shocking.

                         BALA
               He was swarthy...primitive...
               earthy...sensual.

     As she says these things, Z tries to act accordingly.

                         BALA
               He was a worker.  I danced with him
               at a worker's bar just the other day.
               I'm not shocking you, am I?

                         Z
                      (proudly)
               No...as a matter of fact...

                         BALA
                      (shocked)
               OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A
               WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid,
               disgusting WORKER!

     Everybody gasps.  The dancing stops cold.

                         Z
               Gee, uh, could you say it a little
               louder, I think there are some ants
               in the next colony who didn't hear
               you.

                         BALA
               I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!

                         Z
                      (offended)
               That's not what you said the other
               night --

                         BALA
                      (now she's panicked)
               Quiet -- sshhh!!

                         Z
                      (digging it in)
               -- At the worker bar!  You were
               pretty hot to trot then!

                         BALA
               SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!

     A livid Formica is stalking over towards them.

                         FORMICA
                      (furious)
               What's this?  A worker has been
               masquerading as a war hero?!

                         Z
               Well it wasn't a masquerade, really,
               it was more what I'd call a clever
               ruse --

                         FORMICA
               ARREST HIM!

                         Z
               Can't we all settle this like
               adults -- we're not larvae anymore --

     Angry officers begin to surround Z, who hides behind Bala in
     fear, using her as a shield.

                         QUEEN
               Oh my god!  He's taking her hostage!

                         Z
               No I'm not -- I mean -- nobody move!
               Or the Princess gets it!

     People shout and scream, as Z backs up with the
     Princess...into the kitchen.

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Z backs up into the kitchen, still pulling Bala along with
     him.  Here, ant chefs are preparing food for the party,
     vomiting little florets onto a platter.  Formica and the
     soldiers follow them in.

                         Z
                      (to Formica)
               Stay back, you lunatic!  Do you think
               I don't know how to use this?

     Z realizes that he's pointing his finger at them.

                         Z
               Uh-oh.

     The officers rush for...and Z, with Bala in tow, falls
     backwards into an opening marked, "GARBAGE".

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     HOLD ON: the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT.  Nothing happens for a
     moment.  Then --

     From a distance, we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING,
     dopplering closer --

     -- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit, right
     into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly.

     Bala sits up, coated in mud.  Z is nowhere to be seen.
     Because she's on top of him.

                         PRINCESS
               This is thoroughly unacceptable!

                         Z
               You're telling me...

     She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where
     soldiers are already issuing to get her...

                         BALA
               I'm coming!  I'm coming!

     But...just as Bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a
     gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony,
     sizzling the ground as it moves along...and IGNITES the lead
     soldier into FLAMES!  Bala looks stunned.

     Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we
     look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the
     beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure
     (a seven year old kid) holding it.

     Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the
     colony and runs the other way.

                         BALA
               I'm going!  I'm going'

     ...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which
     follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING
     in her footsteps.

     Z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that
     he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging
     it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts
     into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some
     flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some
     grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. WEED CLUMP - DAY

     Z and Bala dust themselves off.

                         BALA
               What was that thing?

                         Z
               How should I know?

                         BALA
               I order you to find out where we are!

                         Z
               Alright, alright, I'll try to get
               directions from one of the locals.

     Z tries to flag down some passing bees.

                         Z
               Excuse me, I --
                      (it passes him by;
                       he tries the next)
               Pardon me --
                      (same response)
               And they call them social insects.

                         BALA
               Climb up that tree and get a better
               view!

     Bala points to a thin blade of grass.  Gingerly, Z tests the
     grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so
     that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down
     face with Bala.

                         BALA
               I've been kidnapped by the village
               idiot.

                         Z
               Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot
               who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who
               lets herself get kidnapped by the
               idiot?

                         BALA
               How dare you speak to me like that?
               I'm the Princess!

     Z squares up with her.

                         Z
               Theoretically, yes.  But is the
               monarchical hierarchy applicable
               without the underlying social
               structure to support it?

                         BALA
               Of course!  It defines society!  To
               deny the precept is to say that order
               is an arbitrary distinction applied
               by the society itself!

                         Z
               But can there be a society composed
               of just two ants?

                         BALA
               No!  There's no such thing as "just
               two ants."  You never see just two
               ants -- you see a million ants!

                         Z
               Look around, sweetheart.

     She looks around.  She doesn't like what she sees.  She
     glowers at Z.

                         BALA
               I -- hate -- you.

                         Z
               Well I guess that makes us even.

                         BALA
               Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're
               crazy about me!  That's why you lied
               and cheated to get near me!

                         Z
               Oh come on, you're the one who came
               after me -- the swarthy, earthy,
               sensual worker!

                         BALA
                      (repulsed)
               I was slumming it!  I danced with you
               because you were the most pathetic
               specimen in the place!

                         Z
               Is that the same standard you used to
               choose General Formica?

                         BALA
               I didn't choose him.  What kind  of
               idiot would...
                      (unconvincingly)
               ...choose who she wanted to marry?

     She shakes herself out of it.

                         BALA
               Now, worker, you shall take me back
               to the colony, and have your head cut
               off and stuck on a sharp pole!

                         Z
               Well, that's an appealing offer,
               but...considering the options...
                      (he decides)
               You go back.  Me, I'm going to
               Insectopia.

                         BALA
               Insectopia?  You stupid worker,
               that's just a fairy tale!

                         Z
               Yeah, well I have it on a reliable
               source...
                      (he knows that was
                       maybe stretching it)
               that it exists.  Now you follow
               the yellow egg...
                      (looking around)
               That direction.

                         BALA
               Worker!  Come back here now!

                         Z
               I've got a name.  It's Z.

                         BALA
               That's not a name!  That's just a
               letter!

     Z, meanwhile, hits the road.  Bala has no idea of where to
     go.  Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes
     through to her.

     We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle
     sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING,
     CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all
     directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing
     her with his beady gaze.

                         BALA
                      (clears her throat)
               Worker?
                      (no response...louder
                       now)
               Oh WORKER?  Where are you?
                      (getting desperate)
               Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!!

     Bala heads off after Z.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     The mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel.
     The foreman moves up the line, BERATING the workers, yelling
     at them to dig faster.

                         AZTECA
               I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein'
               yelled at.

                         WORKER #1
               What do you want, we're just workers.

                         WEAVER
               You know, you're not just workers --
               you can be whatever you want to be!
               Look at Z!  He started as a worker --
               then he became a soldier!

                         AZTECA
               That's right!  He slaughtered
               hundreds of termites single-handedly!

                         WORKER #2
               I heard about this guy.
                      (turning to the other
                       workers)
               He crashed a party at the palace.
               Then he took a hike with one of the
               royal babes!  And when they tried to
               stop him, he just looked at a
               couple'a guards, and they burst into
               flames!

                         WORKER ANT #1
               You're nuts, how could a worker do
               all that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, because he's more than a
               worker...he's a...what did he call
               it, Azteca...

                         AZTECA
               Invisible!

                         WEAVER
               No -- an individual!

                         WORKER #2
               What's that?

                         WEAVER
               Well, it's...someone with his own
               point of view...someone who does what
               he wants, not whatever he's told to
               do!

                         AZTECA
                      (eyes lit up,
                       watching Weaver)
               Someone who follows his heart!

                         WEAVER
                      (taking Azteca's hand)
               Right...because every ant's important!

                         WORKER #2
                      (scoffs)
               But that would mean I'm important.

                         WORKER #1
               I'm outta here, this sounds like
               trouble to me.

     But more ants are gathering 'round.

                         WEAVER
               We can all be individuals!  Just like
               Z!

     Weaver and Azteca hold hands.  More ants are gathering
     around, dropping their tools...

     EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY

     LONG SHOT.  A glimmering desert landscape (think of "The
     Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia).  Two small figures can
     be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness.

     They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the
     park, which they perceive to be a "desert".

                         BALA
               Water...water...

                         Z
               Water...water -- oh, you already said
               that.

                         BALA
                      (walking along)
               My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is
               cracking...I wish I'd never met you,
               you ruined my life.

                         Z
               I ruined your life?  Look, I was
               perfectly happy until I met you --
               alright, I was miserable, but I was
               happily miserable.

     Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger
     and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL
     (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards
     them).

                         BALA
               Look out!

     Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past
     with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a
     gigantic millwheel.

                         BALA
               We're going to die!

                         Z
               Come on -- it's gone!  What are the
               chances of that happening again?

     No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike
     thunders past.

                         Z
               Well I'll be.

     Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she
     pushes him away.

                         BALA
               Why didn't I listen to my mother
               ...why'd I have to go looking for
               trouble? Any ant would have given
               their left legs to be in my
               position...what's wrong with me?

                         Z
               Want a list?

                         BALA
                      (urgent)
               Wait, I hear something!

     We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause
     and then we can hear it again...

     Z and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the
     path).  Beyond, the grass starts up again.  They have come to
     the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path)
     Through the blades of grass, we can see...

                         Z
               It's...it's...


                         BALA
               WATER!!!

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them.  It is, in fact, the
     overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed...as Z
     and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain
     and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall).

     Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping.
     They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't
     like each other.

                         Z
               This lake is huge!  And so close to
               the colony!  Think of the vacation
               potential!

                         BALA
               Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take
               a nap.

                         Z
               Listen, "Princess", you can't order
               me around.  Out here, you're not the
               boss anymore -- out here, you're
               just --

     -- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the
     fountain falls on him.  It may not sound like much, but to Z
     it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had
     engulfed him.

     Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the
     droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down.
     Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for
     help.  But his screams are muffled in the water.

                         BALA
                      (annoyed)
               Out here I'm just what?

                         Z
                      (through the water)
               Hlllllllp!

                         BALA
                      (hands on hips)
               Stop fooling around in there.

     By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned
     upside-down.  He manages to get one foreleg out of the
     droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls
     Bala in by the leg.

                         BALA
               Let me go!!!

     But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet,
     and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala
     yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is
     she's yelling through the water.

     Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing,
     alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries
     to defend himself.  Finally all this commotion is enough to
     make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing,
     sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground.

     They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.

                         BALA
                      (chants to herself)
               I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm
               going to be rescued soon.  I'm going
               to be rescued soon.

     Z watches her incredulously.

                         Z
               Princess, has it ever occurred to you
               that they're not going to rescue you?

                         BALA
               General Formica won't let me die out
               here.  I'm his fiancee.

                         Z
               Look.  How many other Princesses are
               there?

                         BALA
               Five thousand three hundred and
               ninety -- no.  About five thousand
               four hundred by now.

                         Z
               And only you can become a Queen?

                         BALA
               Well...no, but --

                         Z
               So what makes you so special?

                         BALA
                      (hesitates)
               Well...I am the oldest.

     Bala turns from Z.  She's thinking things over, realization
     dawning on her.

                         BALA
               By three seconds...

     She looks out into the grass forest.

                         BALA
                      (to herself)
               You're right.  There are as many
               Princesses...as there are blades of
               grass.

     Z, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Formica and Carpenter are walking into the entrance of the
     tunnel with a squad of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1!
               We can't afford any delays on this
               project!

                         CARPENTER
               I've never seen anything like it,
               General, they're they're...well, look!

     Ahead of them, a group of a few hundred workers have stopped
     work and are sitting down, chanting...

                         WORKER ANTS
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     A worker moves forward to join the strikers, tossing down his
     tool.

                         FOREMAN
                      (yelling at him)
               Where do ya think you're going?  Get
               back to work!

                         WORKER #1
               Buzz off, I'm important!
                      (joining the others)
               Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!


     At the center of the group, Weaver and Azteca are holding
     hands, leading the chant.

                         FORMICA
               Notice the big one, holding hands
               with the female?

                         CARPENTER
               Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?

                         FORMICA
                      (calculating)
               No one should have to.  Have him
               brought to me.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

     A nervous Weaver is sitting across from Formica, flanked by
     a couple of stoic guards.  Carpenter stands smiling by the
     side door.  There is no obvious threat to Weaver, but the
     atmosphere is truly intimidating.

                         FORMICA
               So this Z...he fancies himself an
               individual?

                         WEAVER
               Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know,
               really, sir.

                         FORMICA
                      (patronizing)
               Well now you haven't fallen for this
               silly idea of individuality, have
               you?

                         WEAVER
               Oh, no, sir!

                         FORMICA
               Good.  You're a good soldier.

                         WEAVER
               Thank you, sir.

     Weaver begins to relax a bit.

                         FORMICA
               So tell me.  Where's Z?

                         WEAVER
               I...I have no idea, sir.

                         FORMICA
               Okay, son.

     He pats Weaver on the shoulder.

                         FORMICA
               We know what makes an ant colony
               strong, don't we?  We know that no
               ant can be an individual.  No single
               ant matters, right?

                         WEAVER
                      (enthusiastically)
               That's correct, sir!

                         FORMICA
                      (points at a guard)
               Not that one.
                      (another guard)
               Or that one.

                         WEAVER
               No, sir!

     Formica nods at Carpenter, who smiles and opens a door.  Two
     soldiers walk in, holding Azteca.  The color drains from
     Weaver's face.

                         FORMICA
                      (calmly, with
                       satisfaction)
               Or that one?  Her life doesn't
               matter, does it?

                         AZTECA
               Don't tell that tightass anything,
               Weaver!

     Weaver starts to get up, but the guards behind him hold him
     down.

                         WEAVER
               Wait!  Just let her go!  Z's long
               gone anyway, following some golden
               egg to Insectopia!  You'll never
               catch him!

     Formica's face lights up.

                         FORMICA
               Insectopia, hunh?...See why
               individuality is so dangerous?  It
               can always be used against you.
                      (to the guards)
               If this sissy here wants to dig,
               he'll dig.  Send them both back to
               the tunnel project.  Double their
               workload.

     The guards exit with Weaver and Azteca.

                         FORMICA
               What do we have on this "Insectopia"?

                         CARPENTER
               Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors.
               Nothing reliable.

                         FORMICA
               Desperate times call for desperate
               measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.

                         CARPENTER
                      (frightened)
               Ant Team Six...

     EXT.  GRASS JUNGLE - DAY

     Z and Bala are lost, wandering through the grass

                         BALA
                      (looking hopeless)
               I swear, we've passed this blade of
               grass three times.

     Z keeps marching on.

                         BALA
               Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have
               walked halfway across the world by
               now!  How did I get into this mess...

                         Z
                      (too shy to look at
                       her)
               Come on...tell me there wasn't just
               a little...something between us that
               first night at the bar.  The night we
               danced.

                         BALA
                      (sadly)
               What difference does it make...we're
               both going to starve to death, or get
               squished, or set on fire...

     But Z is just gawking.  The shot expands to show that they
     have stumbled onto...

                         Z
               ...The land of red and white...

     EXT. FALSE INSECTOPIA - DAY

     A PICNICGROUNDS...A red and white picnic blanket, which to
     the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion, stretches
     before them.  They gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper
     shaker.

     Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato
     salad, and sandwiches stacked high.  It all looks perfect,
     with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist
     architecture.  In fact, it looks a little too perfect.

                         Z
               We've found it!  Insectopia!  Look at
               all this food'

                         BALA
                      (amazed)
               You were right...you were right!
                      (smiling happily)
               Z, it's beautiful!

                         Z
               Let's dig in!

     Z goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but -- BOOIIING! -- he's
     prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it.

                         Z
               There's - there's some kind of force
               field!

     Bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap.  Then both
     of them hear laughter from above.

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (lockjawed accent)
               Muffy, look, party-crashers.

                         FEMALE WASP (O.S.)
                      (laughing)
               They're simply too much, Chip!

     Bala and Z look up to see two large, yellow WASPS hovering in
     the air above them.  The husband and wife wasps have
     lockjawed, William F. Buckleyesque accents.

                         MALE WASP
                      (to Z and Bala)
               You down there, haven't you ever been
               to a picnic?

                         Z
               Hunh?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Habla Ingles?
                      (to Male Wasp)
               Well I really don't know who they are.

                         Z
               We're ants!

     The Male Wasp zooms in closer.

                         MALE WASP
               Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we?
                      (to Z)
               Are you related to the Fifth Avenue
               ants?

                         FEMALE WASP
               Darling, do you have to talk to any
               insect from off the street?

                         MALE WASP
               Just being friendly, Poopsie.

                         BALA
               Hello?  I'm not just "any insect".
               My mother is the Queen.
                      (momentously)
               I'm Princess Bala!

                         MALE WASP
                      (under his breath)
               They're Eurotrash, dear.

     We hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit
     down for their picnic lunch.  Gigantic hands reach down and
     pull away the "force fields".

                         MALE WASP
               Lunch!
                      (to Z)
               A little piece of advice, sport --
               bob and weave!  Bob and weave!

                         BALA
               What do you mean?

                         MALE WASP
               Well -- like my father used to say --
               there's no such thing as a free meal!

     The wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and
     then dashing away again...

                         THE WASPS
               Excuse me -- I'll have some potato
               salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if
               I do!  After you! (etc.)

     -- But all is not well.  We pull back to reveal that Z and
     Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is
     attached to a giant sneaker.  Which moves.

                         Z
               I sort of imagined Insectopia a
               little differently --

     Just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and
     the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out
     of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an
     aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground.

                         BALA
               Oh...my...God.

                         MALE WASP
                      (shaking her)
               Muffy!  Muffy!  Wake up!

     But she doesn't move.  The Male Wasp stares up at the sky.

                         MALE WASP
                      (heartbroken)
               WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????

     But Z, also looking up, has no time to commiserate.

                         Z
               Bala, look out!!

     They are only saved by the fact that they are so small - .the
     holes of the swatter pass over them.

     The woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants,
     throws it to the side and tries stomping on them...

     Before Bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a
     thunderous BOOM that shakes the ground.

                         BALA
               MMMffllmmm...

     The shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away...and we
     see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle-
     soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum!

                         BALA
               Z!  Help me!!!

     But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping,
     ferris-wheel-like motion.  BOOM.  The sneaker on which Bala
     is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on Z, too --

                         Z
               Bala!
                      (mournfully)
               I'll never see her again...

     -- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing
     Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --

                         BALA
               Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere!

     -- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get
     the bubblegum off her shoe...Z heart sinks as the shoe Bala's
     stuck on lopes off into the distance...

                         Z
                      (thinks)
               These things always come in twos...

     He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --

                         Z
               Take me to your leader!

     Z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment
     catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace.

                         Z
               Whoooooooaaaa!!!

     The sneaker lifts off into the air, with Z holding on for
     dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away
     from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the
     landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the
     background...

                         Z
               Bala!  Come back here!

     For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it
     descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free-
     fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again...

                         BALA
               Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck!

     --  But Z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends.
     The sneaker hits the ground, and Z can feel himself
     again...it's now or never.

                         Z
                      (Tarzan whoop)
               Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!

     As the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling
     through the air and catching one of the laces of Bala's
     sneaker...the momentum swings him up and under the sole...

                         BALA
               Z!  You're here!

     Z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala.  Now he's
     stuck too.

                         Z
                      (ruefully)
               Yeah.  I'm here.

     The sneaker descends again.  Z and Bala hold hands and SCREAM
     as they see the ground rise too meet them...

     THUD!  They're squished deeper into the bubblegum.  The
     sneaker rises again...

                         BALA
                      (emotional)
               Z...if we don't make it...I just want
               you to know....

                         Z
                      (touched)
               Yes?

                         BALA
               This is all your fault!!!

     The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but
     instead it just hovers there.  (The person wearing it is
     balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum
     with a penny).

                         Z
               We're safe...

     Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny
     is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high.  The huge image
     of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them.

                         Z
               Who the hell is that?!!!

     The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker,
     bringing Bala and Z along with it.  They're carried through
     the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over
     in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM...

     ...and land with a CRASH in total darkness.

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     The "lake" where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water
     droplet.

     The earth shakes as a HUGE, MONSTROUS creature approaches the
     lake - and begins to drink from it.  The creature seems to
     hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head.  It's a
     Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen
     from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie.

                         TOUGH VOICE (O.S.)
               Ant Team Six -- take him out!

     The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching
     intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though
     they're attacking the Death Star!

     The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are
     making a diversionary run...

     and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his
     soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy.

     The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away, YIPPING!

     The members of ANT TEAM SIX, a crack team of hardcore flying-
     ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and
     land.

                         MAJOR MANDIBLE
               And don't come back, you sissy!

     MAJOR MANDIBLE, Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into
     frame.  He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier.
     The rest of his team fan out to search the area.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO ANT
               Z and the Princess were here, sir.
               Signs of a struggle.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's get a read on that feremone
               track.

                         COMMANDO ANT #1
                      (to the others)
               Get the sniffer!

     Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a
     piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a
     highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense
     of smell.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...find Bala...

     The tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs
     the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter...

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (as he's swivelled)
               Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono
               no...

     Finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one
     direction and saying, "Yeahyeahyeahyeah..."

                         COMMANDO ANT #3
               Got 'em!  Ten clicks from here!

                         MANDIBLE
               Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing,
               wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel
               SCUM!
                      (yelling into the
                       distance)
               I AM COMING FOR YOU!  YOU ARE ONE
               DEAD ANT, MISTER!

     Mandible's muscles bulge.  The veins in his head throb.  This
     is one ass-kicking ant.  Even Mandible's troops look scared
     of him.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's MOVE!  GO, people!  GO!  GO!
               GO!  GO!  GO!

     Ant Team Six takes to the air, heading in the direction
     indicated by the tracker ant.

     INT. TRASH BAG - DAY

     Darkness.  Out of it we hear the voices of Z and Bala.

                         BALA
               Come on, Z.

                         Z
               Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up.
               I...I don't know what I was thinking.
               "Insectopia".

     In one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little
     hole through which a shaft of light is falling.  Bala
     proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and
     bigger...

                         Z
                      (defeated)
               There's only one thing worse than an
               ant who goes around mindlessly
               following orders, and that's an ant
               who's too dumb to go around
               mindlessly following orders.

     Bala stops...she notices that they're being watched.  She's
     emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop
     away gracefully.  Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage
     area.  And above them and below them, peering from garbage
     cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural
     assortment of insects are regarding them.

     A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts.

                         FLY
               What's with the bummer attitude?

     A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in.

                         BUTTERFLY
               Yeah -- nobody stresses out in
               Insectopia!

                         BALA
               Did you say...

                         Z
                      (joining Bala)
               ...Insectopia?

     Z and Bala look around.  Just to get things straight, the
     garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- that would be seeing
     it through human eyes.  Instead, we're looking at it through
     ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise.  Not the
     ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land
     of plenty.

     The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective
     walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic,
     thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the
     pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a
     gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into
     the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which
     appears as a multi-chambered concave dome.  Everywhere,
     insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in
     that's like an insect version of Woodstock.

     Bala and Z are awe-struck.  Bala turns to Z.

                         BALA
                      (happily)
               Z, we made it!

                         FLY
                      (alighting on the
                       grapefruit)
               C'mon in!  The nectar's fine!

     Like a kid at an amusement park, Z slides down the smooth
     side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he
     slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped
     tunnel), and is shot out...

                         Z
               Yippeeeeee!

     ...into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade, which he
     alternately drinks and swims through...

     Down at the bottlecap, Z is drying himself off.  Then he
     sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic TERMITE.

                         Z
                      (terrified)
               AAAAAGH!!!

     Surprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified...

                         FLY
                      (to Z)
               Hey, take it easy!  There's nothin'
               to be afraid of!

                         Z
               Yeah, well, I make it a practice not
               to trust anyone who shoots acid out
               of their forehead.

                         CRICKET
               Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't
               judge people by how many arms and
               legs we've got.

                         FLY
               Yeah, back home, they called me a
               fruitfly.  But here, I'm known
               as...
                      (with attitude)
               Superfly.

                         CRICKET
               Anyway, big Gus is mellow.

     The termite sticks his hand out.  A drop of acid drips from
     his head and splashes at Z's feet.

                         Z
                      (taking his hand,
                       disgusted)
               Charmed.

     Z reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as Bala watches,
     smiling.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     The insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by
     the still-red ember of a match.  Platters heaped with food
     lie untouched as they pat their bellies...

     Z and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they
     had just met for the first time.

                         Z
               So...you never did tell me...what
               made you come out to the worker bar
               that night?

                         BALA
               Just looking for fun, adventure,
               trouble, I guess.

                         Z
               Well, "trouble" is my middle name.
               Actually, my  middle name is .985,
               but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala,
               I...I actually have something of
               yours...you left it at the bar that
               night.

     Z takes out Bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in
     a pocket.

                         Z
               Sorry, it's been through a war, not
               to mention everything else...

                         BALA
               You held onto this all that time?

                         Z
               Well, I...I know it's a little
               strange, but...I thought it might
               come in handy if I...needed a scarf
               someday.
                      (embarrassed)
               Well, to be honest, I just liked
               having it.

     He hands it back to her.  Bala looks at Z, frankly, openly.
     For a moment Z is shy.  Then he looks at her too.  They're
     two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss,
     when --

                         BEETLE
               Hey Z!

     The moment is wrecked.  Z looks up.  A chubby beetle stands
     there with Gus the termite.

                         BEETLE
               Wanna bring back dessert?  There's a
               thirty foot long blimp in the next
               can, made completely of chocolate!

                         Z
                      (annoyed)
               Sure.  I wasn't busy or anything.

     Z gets up to go with them.

                         Z
               Great timing, guys.  Ever wonder why
               they call you "pests"?

     EXT.  INSECTOPIA, TOP OF CAN - NIGHT

     As Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast.
     The tracker ant is going nuts.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yesyesyesyesyes --

     One of the commandoes puts his hand over the tracker's mouth
     to shut him up.  Mandible communicates with his troops by
     pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly
     whispering into it, as though it were one of those commando
     headsets.  His troops do likewise.

                         MANDIBLE
               Talk to me.

                         COMMANDO #1
               I've got a read on the Princess --
               but target Z isn't accounted for.

                         MANDIBLE
               Let's move in.

     EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Back at the feast, a cricket strums on his legs like a
     guitar, opining about life and the universe to a bunch of
     other chilled-out, hippyesque insects...Bala taps her feet to
     the song.

                         CRICKET
               What if, like...we're just these tiny
               little things, and we're just like
               part of this whole other huge
               universe, that's like, so big we
               don't even know it exists?

                         LADYBUG
               Man...that's so deep...

     At that moment Ant Team Six rapels down from the top of the
     garbage bin, landing amongst the insects.

                         MANDIBLE
               EVERYBODY DOWN!

     The cricket gets up to confront Mandible, but Mandible cold
     cocks him with a right to the jaw.  The other insects, too
     surprised to fight, just do as they're told.

                         MANDIBLE
               Alright, you hippy scum!  Make one
               move and I'll exterminate you!

     A couple of commandoes grab Bala by the arms and heave her up.

                         BALA
               Stop!  You don't understand!

                         MANDIBLE
               I don't have to understand, Missy --
               I've got orders.  Now where's Z?

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

     Z, the termite, the beetle and the fly are happily carrying
     a huge M&M back to the feast.

                         FLY
               Man, your girl is fly, know what I'm
               saying?

                         Z
                      (overdoing it)
               Oh, Bala?  I guess she's okay, you
               know, for a princess.  I mean, I
               usually date queens, or you know,
               empresses, because sometimes the
               lesser nobility are too much in awe
               of my smouldering sensuality.  Please
               stop me if I'm making you feel
               inadequate.

     They throw down the M&M, which lands with a THUD.  Z notices
     that the rest of the insects look spooked.

                         Z
               What's the matter?  This place is as
               cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out
               time.

     Z looks around.

                         LADYBUG
               Bala's been kidnapped!  Some flying
               ants took her back to the colony!

                         Z
               She's been kidnapped?!  But I can't
               live without her!

     Z just stands there, heartbroken.

                         Z
                      (determined)
               I'm going back.  I've got to get her.
               Who'll come with me?

     Z looks around.  Nobody's volunteering.  Nothing but sheepish
     looks and shuffling from the insects of Insectopia.

     Z looks disheartened.  He's about to leave when --

                         MALE WASP (O.S.)
               I'll go.

     The male wasp is hovering nearby.

                         Z
                      (surprised)
               You?!

                         MALE WASP
               I know what it's like to lose
               someone...I keep hearing the sound of
               Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take
               you.

     Z hops on the wasp's back.

                         Z
               Let's go, pal!

     The wasp takes off, leaving the other insects looking a
     little chastized.

                         FLY
               Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug.

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. SKY ABOVE COLONY - MORNING

     The wasp and Z fly high above the colony...

                         Z
               Wow...I never saw things this way...

     From here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the
     colony...the "desert" (an asphalt path) and across it, the
     "lake" (the overflowing water fountain)

                         Z
               Things look so close together from up
               here...there's the desert...and the
               lake...
                      (thinking about
                       something)
               it's not far from the colony at all...

     Suddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air.

                         MALE WASP
               Sorry.  Turbulence.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Formica sits at his desk, going over some plans.  Formica's
     chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye
     sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door.
     The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other
     insects.

     Ant Team Six burst in the doors of Formica's office, carrying
     the struggling and kicking Bala.  One of the commandoes sets
     the tracker ant one the floor...then Formica gets up from his
     desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him.

                         FORMICA
               Princess Bala.  Good.
                      (with urgency)
               Where's Z?

     Bala replies warily.

                         BALA
               He's...he's dead.
                      (covering for Z)
               You don't have to look for him
               anymore.  He was eaten by a praying
               mantis.

                         FORMICA
                      (regretfully)
               It's a shame he died prematurely...I
               was hoping to kill him myself.

                         BALA
               Well you'll never be able to hurt him
               where he is now.
                      (sadly)
               I miss him already.

                         FORMICA
                      (surprised)
               You miss him?  Why?

                         BALA
                      (angry)
               Because...because he's twice the ant
               that you are.  I could never go
               through with marrying you.  I'm --
               I'm an individual, and when I get
               married, it'll be to someone I choose.

     The soldiers look shocked.  For a moment, Formica looks
     furious.  Then he just shrugs.

                         FORMICA
                      (shaking his head)
               Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old
               soldier, and the ways of the feminine
               mind are a little too complex for me.
               But one thing I do know is, there are
               more Princesses where you came from.
               I just hope they're not all like you.
               In the meantime, maybe we can arrange
               for you to see Z again after all.

     He gestures to the commandoes, who drag her out the door.  We
     notice that the tracker ant has been left behind.

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Z hops down from the wasp, who has landed near the entrance
     to the colony.

                         MALE WASP
               Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect,
               you're alright by me.

                         Z
               Thanks, Chip.

     They shake hands and the wasp flies off.

                         Z
                      (to himself)
               How am I going to get in?  The place
               is crawling with soldiers!

     Z starts for the nearest entrance -- but he's spotted by a
     couple of SOLDIER ANTS.

                         SOLDIER ANT
               You there!  Worker!

     Z's caught -- it's over.  He turns around with his hands up.

                         Z
               Don't bite!  I surrender!

                         SOLDIER ANT
               What are you doing out here!  All
               workers are to remain inside the
               colony, by orders of General Formica!

     Z can't believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued.

                         Z
                      (heading inside)
               Well...if you insist...

     INT. MEGATUNNEL - DAY

     The Queen, with Formica striding at her side, is carried by
     a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the
     bottom end of the Mega Tunnel, where a red ribbon waits to be
     cut.

                         QUEEN
               Very impressive, General.

     Behind her, hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded,
     looking confused and expectant.  Some of them clutch little
     flags and noisemakers...

                         MANDIBLE
               Wave that flag, you maggot!

     ...which we see are being handed out to them by Ant Team Six.

                         FORMICA
               Is there anything wrong, your majesty?

     The Queen is looking around unhappily.

                         QUEEN
               It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish
               she were here for this special moment.

     Formica warmly places his hand on the Queen's shoulder.

                         FORMICA
                      (falsely supportive)
               She is, your majesty.  She is.

     The CAMERA heads up the long, long tunnel, where we see...

     INT. MID SKYLIGHT TUNNEL

     Bala, tied and gagged.  She's at the point in the Megatunnel
     where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface.  She
     struggles against her bonds, but can't get loose.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Elsewhere in the colony, a column of soldiers marches by, and
     we hear the TROMP-TROMP-TROMP of their boots.  When they've
     gone, Z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirt...he
     heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers...

     INT. OUTSIDE FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

     Z creeps around the outside of Formica's chambers.  This part
     of the colony seems to be deserted.

                         Z
               Geez, this place really empties out
               in August.  Where is everybody?

     Z walks up to the skull that houses Formica's chambers and
     peeks in the eye socket.

     INT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS

     Inside, the Tracker Ant, who's been left behind, switches
     "on", eyes glowing.  Z enters the chamber cautiously.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (sniffing)
               Z!  Z!  I smell Z!

     For a moment, Z's afraid.  Then he sees the small Tracker Ant
     doesn't seem hostile.

                         Z
               You "smell" me?  Well look, I -- I've
               been out in the wilderness for a
               while, and --

     The tracker ant keeps sniffing.  Z waves his hand in front of
     the blind ant's eyes.

                         Z
                      (getting it)
               Hey, wait, you're...you're one of
               those pheremone sniffers, aren't you?
               Maybe you can help me...I'm looking
               for a friend of mine, Princess Bala.

                         TRACKER ANT
                      (enthusiastic)
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find
               Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah!

     Z picks up the tracker ant.

                         Z
               Just remember, I met her first.

     Z, carrying the little tracker ant, heads out, following its
     lead...

     Through this and that passage, as the Tracker Ant gets more
     and more insistent...And finally straight to a blank wall.

                         TRACKER ANT
               Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Bala's through there?

                         TRACKER ANT
               Bala...Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...

                         Z
               Great.  More digging.  This is why I
               left in the first place.

     Z can answer his own question.  He puts down the tracker ant,
     with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli,
     starts digging through the wall...

     INT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

     Meanwhile, A member of Ant Team Six -- the stupidest member,
     in fact, waits at the very top of the tunnel, where it
     narrows almost to a point.  He's hanging from a winch, and
     has a little hammer and chisel in his hand.  He's WHISTLING,
     awaiting instructions.

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z emerges from the tunnel he's dug, spits a load of dirt out
     of his mouth and wipes his hands off.  Nearby, Bala lies
     there, bound and gagged.

                         Z
               Bala!

     Z unties Bala and undoes her gag.

                         BALA
               Z!  You came back!

     They HUG.

                         Z
               Why do they have you tied up here?

                         BALA
               There's something going on, Z --

     From here, Z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd
     is gathering.

                         BALA
               They're having a ceremony to open the
               Megatunnel...

     We can hear the sound of WATER SHIFTING somewhere above.  He
     looks up the tunnel...in the distance, we can make out the
     silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall...

                         Z
               Bala, that -- that lake we found --
               I think the tunnel's right underneath
               it!
                      (horrified)
               -- Formica's going to flood the
               colony!!!  That's what he meant when
               said there were too many ants!

                         BALA
               Oh no...

     Bala looks too shocked to move.  Z starts pushing her into
     the tunnel he made, and starts heading down towards the crowd.

                         BALA
               Z!  what are you doing?

                         Z
               I know it's crazy, but -- I can't
               just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If
               I've learned anything, it's that the
               problems of two people don't add up
               to a hill of ants in this world.  Or
               beans.  Something like that.  Anyway,
               I've got to warn the others.

     Z looks into Bala's eyes.

                         Z
               Head for the surface, Bala.  If I
               don't make it, well...we'll always
               have Insectopia.

     Z kisses Bala.  Then he starts running down the tunnel
     towards the crowd...

                         BALA
                      (following him)
               Z!!! Wait for me!

     INT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     All the SOLDIERS are filtering out of the assembly area,
     leaving the workers behind.  As his troops march by, Formica
     steps to the side and hands the Queen a pair of scissors to
     cut the ribbon strung across the Megatunnel.

                         FORMICA
               Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of
               state keep me from attending the
               ceremony.

                         QUEEN
               But General -- this tunnel is your
               baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

                         FORMICA
               'Fraid not, your majesty.
                      (with regret)
               Goodbye, your majesty.

                         QUEEN
               Very well, General -- I know you --
               all work and no play!

                         FORMICA
               Alright, let's move out!

     Formica, surrounded by his bodyguards, hurries off as the
     Queen readies to cut the ribbon...

                         QUEEN
               In the name of the colony, I declare
               this tunnel open!

     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Z and Bala sprint towards the bottom end of the tunnel...

                         Z
               Stoooooop!

     -- and then pull back to see Queen cut the ribbon -- she
     looks up and sees --

                         QUEEN
               Bala!

                         BALA
               Mom!

     Z calls out to the crowd.

                         Z
               Listen up!  We've all got to get out
               of here!  This place is going to
               flood!

     The workers are unconvinced.

                         WORKER #1
               Are you nuts?

                         Z
               You've got to believe me!

                         WORKER #2
               Oh yeah?  What makes you so special,
               Mr. Know-It-All?

                         Z
               I'm Z.

     The workers are even more sceptical.  A laugh goes up from
     the crowd.

                         WORKER #3
               You're Z?  Gimme a break!  Z's ten
               milimeters tall!

                         WORKER #4
               -- and he can kill termites with his
               bare hands!  You're just some scrawny
               worker with a mental problem!

                         Z
               I am Z!

                         WORKER #1
               No you're not!

                         WEAVER
               Yes he is.

     Weaver steps out of the crowd.

                         Z
               Weaver!

     Weaver runs up to Z and hugs him, starting to cry.

                         WORKERS
               Hey...it is Z...listen to what he
               says! [etc].

                         WEAVER
               Z...I'm so sorry!  I --

                         Z
               Don't worry about it, pal.

     Nearby, Bala and the Queen hug.  The Queen looks over at Z.

                         QUEEN
                      (distastefully)
               Oh...it's that social-climbing worker
               again -- what does he want?

                         Z
                      (in response)
               To save you all!  Now we've got to go!

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     Outside of the colony, where Formica, surrounded by the army,
     gives a signal to Mandible by drawing his finger across his
     throat...

                         MANDIBLE
                      (talking into his
                       antenna)
               Let 'er rip!

     INT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

     AT THE TOP OF THE TUNNEL, the commando starts chiseling away
     furiously at the wall...and nothing but dust falls down.  The
     commando looks at the dust as it falls down, down the long
     tunnel...he looks up at the dry wall...Hmmm...

     Then...

     THE WALL BURSTS OPEN.

     And a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified
     commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel
     like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes...

     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

     Everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the
     tunnel --

                         AZTECA
               Listen!

                         WORKER #1
               He's right!!!

     From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point
     where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing
     down at them...

                         Z
               LET'S MOVE IT!

     All of a sudden there's panic as every ant tries to scramble
     away from the oncoming water...in the confusion, the Queen's
     bearers drop her and scramble over her.

                         QUEEN
               You there!  Stop!  I say!

     The Queen turns, and for a brief moment is silhouetted
     against the white-capped torrent of water...

     ...and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high
     tails it away from the torrent, running so fast that she
     passes some of her bearers on the way...

     And then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the
     Megatunnel, quickly filling up the chamber and branching into
     all of its side tunnels, as we see:

     A group of workers RUNNING up a side tunnel and getting
     consumed by a wave, which crashes down on them like a hand
     slapping a table...

     Another group, the members of which are getting swallowed up
     one by one; one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the
     tunnel and keeps on going, upside-down...it works for a while
     but eventually he, too is swallowed up...

     -- In the Nursery, nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant
     babies...

     In one of the larger access-tunnels, down which thousands of
     workers are fleeing, a group of ants turns and decides to
     make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a
     LIVING DAM.  It holds for a while but then BURSTS scattering
     and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating
     them up...

     And we...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the
     workers -- as well as Z, Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the
     Queen -- have run to.

     The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides.  Water flows
     out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crowd is
     becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters
     rise around them.

                         AZTECA
               There's no way out!

                         QUEEN
               We're all going to drown!!!

                         BALA
               Z...what can we do?

     Z clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then he
     shouts...

                         Z
               Dig!

     The workers turn to look at him questioningly.

                         Z
               We've got to dig a trench around us!

     -- But one of the workers raises his hands.

                         WORKER #1
               Uh...we don't dig any more.  We're
               individuals.

                         WORKER #2
               Yeah.  We're too important to dig.
               You taught us that, Z.  You hate
               digging!

                         Z
                      (at his wits end)
               Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now
               dig!

                         WEAVER
               You heard the ant -- DIG!!!

     The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves,
     passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the
     dry ground.

     -- But they seems to be making little headway against the
     water as it continues to rush in...

     The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to
     this.   As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and
     higher...Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...nearby,
     Azteca is digging like crazy too...Z runs around, directing
     traffic and encouraging the workers...

                         Z
               That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the
               center!  Go on!

     Nearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish.

                         Z
               Your highness...time to get your
               hands dirty!

     Gingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and
     passes it along.  Next thing you know, she's practically
     crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver.

     The water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that...

     ...the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created by
     the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher,
     reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber...

     ...And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat,
     swirling around angrily.

     Now Z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they
     can reach the top --

                         Z
               We need to form a scaffolding around
               this mound -- let's DO IT!

     The workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it,
     forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up
     towards the ceiling...

                         Z
               Now climb!

     The ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top
     of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each
     other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever
     higher towards the top...

     Where they start to dig through the very ceiling...

     ...as, at the bottom of the mound, Z starts to organize the
     hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo
     container...

                         Z
               Okay boys -- take her up!

     Z slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a
     cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those
     plastic toy monkeys...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

     ...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls
     herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground,
     widening the hole...

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     The water is rising...but almost all of the ants have
     escaped...Z clambers up the mound, as the scaffolding of ants
     rolls up from the bottom....

     And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of
     the structure.  As Z hauls himself through the hole in the
     ceiling.

     The entire structure collapses into the angry waters below,
     which seem furious to have missed their prey...

     EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY

                         WORKER
               He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

     The "Z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in.  But the
     jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge,
     surrounding the workers, is FORMICA'S ARMY, circling the mass
     of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind
     them.  Formica himself appears in the front lines, with
     Carpenter and Mandible at his side.

                         FORMICA
               Z.  I should have known.  All that
               work, all that preparation, come to
               nothing.  All because of one stinking
               ant.

     He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers.

                         FORMICA
               ALRIGHT.  WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?

     The workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken
     circle of soldiers.

                         FORMICA
               WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?  I ASKED YOU,
               WHERE'S Z?

     Formica laughs, shaking his head.

                         FORMICA
               Folks, you may have survived that
               flood, but there's no way you're
               gonna escape from me.  I'll make you
               a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader
               Z, and you survive.

     This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.

                         FORMICA
               But if you don't hand him over,
               you're all going to die, each and
               every single..."individual" one of
               you.

     The workers all look at each other.

                         FORMICA
               What shall it be, workers?

     The workers remain frightened but silent.  Z trembles,
     terrified.

                         FORMICA
               Have it your way.

     As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a
     lone figure steps out from the crowd.

                         Z
               Wait...

     Z stands there, shivering with fear.

                         Z
               ...I'm Z.

     For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica's
     gaze.

     Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.

                         WEAVER
               No, I'm Z.

     Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering,
     bravely risking his life for his friend.  Then, AZTECA also
     steps forward.

                         AZTECA
               I'm Z!

     Next, Bala comes forward.

                         BALA
               No, I'm Z.

     More and more ants step forward.

                         WORKERS
               I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my
               brother!  I've been Z for weeks now!

                         QUEEN
                      (regally)
               We are Z.

     Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration.

                         ALL
               I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z!

     Z is plainly flabbergasted.  Formica is outraged.  He gives
     the signal.

                         FORMICA
               ATTACK!

     The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers
     towards the swirling water.  Some workers surround the Queen
     to protect her.  All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia
     alights on the rim of the horizon.

                         FLY
               Hey, guys!

     THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.

                         WASP
               It's them!

     Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the
     ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford
     film.  Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the
     unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has
     turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all
     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and
     now surround the army, dwarfing them.

                         WASP
               Are these hooligans giving you
               trouble, Z?

                         FLY
               Say the word, Z, and we kick their
               butts.

     The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.
     Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be
     bulging out of his face.

                         FORMICA
               What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!
                      (berating his army)
               Come on, you yellow-bellies!
                      (turning on Carpenter)
               Don't just stand there, Carpenter!
               Make an example of yourself!

                         CARPENTER
               Uh, actually, we are outnumbered
               sir...

     Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him.  With
     his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and
     CHARGES Z!

                         FORMICA
               AHHHHHHH!!

     Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet
     blows off his head.  Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,
     slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the
     whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and
     then tumbles over.

     For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.

                         FORMICA (O.S.)
               Help...help me...

     Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica
     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,
     which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes,
     a new expression crossing his features: fear.

                         FORMICA
               Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...

     Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --
     but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...

     Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on
     him.

                         Z
               I thought you said that the life of
               one ant doesn't matter.

     Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to
     realize his error...

                         FORMICA
               I guess it does...to the ant.

     Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z
     and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a
     nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).

     Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while
     HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala fights
     her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then the
     ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.

     Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica,
     carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the best
     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen
     general.

                         CARPENTER
               Sir, if it's any consolation, I still
               think you're completely worthless as
               an individual.

                                              FADE TO:

     CLOSE UP OF Z

     As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.

                         Z
               So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just
               your basic "simple worker overthrows
               the government and winds up with the
               princess" kind of a story.
               You know: there was the big parade
               and everything...

                                              CUT TO:

     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

     A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a medal by
     the Queen.

                                              CUT TO:

     GENERAL FORMICA'S FACE, looking extremely dispeptic.

                         Z (V.O.)
               General Formica was almost
               unemployable.  He eventually got a
               gig as a honeydew keg.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall, his belly
     hideously distended with honeydew.

                         Z (V.O.)
               The Queen asked me to take over his
               job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm
               really not the general type.  I'm
               more the specific type."  So they
               gave the job to Weaver instead.

                                              CUT TO:

     WEAVER, in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his
     feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar.  Carpenter is on
     his hands and knees scrubbing the floor.

                         Z (V.O.)
               Weaver cut the defense budget in
               half.  Now we only have an army of
               five million.

     cut back to

     Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE.

                         Z
               And me, I guess you could say that I
               lived happily ever after.

     Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him.

                         Z
               I mean, I've got the whole package,
               right?  A great life, a beautiful
               wife, and a few kids.

                         BALA
               A few?

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY

     Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to
     their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS.  The children cover
     every horizontal surface.  They run around, cry, laugh, and
     tease each other.  Z looks around the room, looks back at us,
     and shrugs.

                         Z
               Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you
               know?  I wouldn't change a thing.

     The camera pulls up...and away from the ground...to reveal
     that this whole story has been taking place in a small area
     of CENTRAL PARK.  We pull back and back, and see all the
     familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the
     drinking fountain, etc.  We tilt up into the NEW YORK
     SKYLINE.  BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH.

     FADE OUT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
	   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:
					   ASH
			   Why would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
	   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
	   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   The book awoke something dark in
			   the woods.
									   SUPERIMPOSE:
4	  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
	   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
	   white eyes.
5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
	   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.
6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
	   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
	   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8
	   sweep past the moon.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.
9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9
	   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
	   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   ...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.
11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
	   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12
	   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.
13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13
	   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:
					   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
					   "Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
					   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
	   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14
	   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
	   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
	   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
	   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
15	 ASH												 15
	   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
	   BEATING of his heart.
16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					   16
	   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
	   cloud electrifies.
17	 ASH'S BODY										    17
	   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								   18
	   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
	   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
	   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							  19
	   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
	   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
	   a moment later.
20	 ASH												 20
	   looks up from the dust to behold...
21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
	   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
	   Ash.
22	 WARRIOR #1										    22
	   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Hail to him who has come from the
			   sky to deliver us from the terror
			   of the Deadites!  Hail!
23	 ASH												 23
	   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
	   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
25	 ARTHUR											   25
	   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
	   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
	   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.									    26
	   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
	   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH									   27
	   waves a shaky hand.
					   ASH
			   Take is easy now chief. I don't
			   know how I got here and I'm not
			   lookin' for any trouble.
28	 WISEMAN JOHN										  28
	   An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
			   the promised one, written of in
			   the Necronomicon.
29	 ARTHUR											   29
	   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
	   as...
30	 ASH'S CHEST										   30
	   is cut. A thin red gash.
					   ARTHUR
			   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
			   one written of in the Book would
			   not bleed.
31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									    31
	   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
					   ARTHUR
			   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
			   I say to the pit with him!  If he
			   is truly the promised one... he
			   will emerge.
					   WARRIOR #2 AND #3
			   Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
					   GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
			   To the pit with the blackard!
32	 GOLD TOOTH										    32
	   charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
	   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
	   jaw.
33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
	   He tumbles from the horse.
34	 ASH												 34
	   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
	   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
36	 ASH												 36
	   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
	   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.
37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
	   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but
	   manages to hang on for dear life.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell they put the
			   stirrups on this thing!!??
38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
	   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN							   39
	   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR									    40
					   ARTHUR
			   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN						  41
	   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining
	   Warriors watch for sport.
42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
	   They are gaining an Ash.
43	 ASH												 43
	   glances behind him.
44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
	   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
45	 ASH												 45
	   whips his horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYPU!
46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
	   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
	   WHOOSH!!!
47	 ASH												 47
	   ducks the blade.
48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
	   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the
	   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
	   THUNK!
49	 ASH												 49
	   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
	   WHOOSH!
	   ASH looks left...
50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
	   winds up for another blow.
51	 ASH												 51
	   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
52	 THE THREE HORSES									   52
	   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
	   swings.
54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
	   slams the First Horseman across the face.
55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
	   is knocked from his steed.
56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
	   is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
	   end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
	   turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
	   ride at one another.
59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES			  59
	   swinging his Broadsword.
60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES						   60
	   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
	   his chainsaw arm bracket.
	   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
	   place.  CLINK!
	   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
	   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses
	   and yanks again.
61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
	   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
	   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
62	 ASH												 62
	   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
	   escaping his own horse's hooves.
63	 ASH												 63
	   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
	   charges and swings his broadsword.
65	 ASH												 65
	   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings

	   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
	   Horseman as he rides past.
66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					    66
	   is knocked from his horse.
67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
	   bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
	   slams against the back of Ash's skull.
69	 ASH												 69
	   crumples.  He looks up in pain to...
70	 ARTHUR											   70
	   above him. The sun over his shoulder.
71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS								  71
	   gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
					   ARTHUR
			   Bring the prisoner!
	   The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
	   are taken from him.
					   ASH
			   No!
72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
	   secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
	   arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
					   ARTHUR
			   To the castle!
73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
	   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
	   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
	   to run alongside them.
74	 WISEMAN JOHN										  74
	   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He
	   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
	   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN								  75
	   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
76	 EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH					  76
	   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
	   alongside him.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   Move along now!
									   DISSOLVE TO:
77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
	   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
	   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
	   A drawbridge is lowered.  Arthur's warriors ride over it.

78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
	   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
	   walls.
79	 INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   79
	   SHEILA
	   a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
	   searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
	   She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
	   atop his horse.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?
			   Did he not ride with you?
					   ARTHUR
			   Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But
			   last night fell in battle to Duke
			   Henry's men.
	   SHEILA
	   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
	   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
	   at him as he's dragged along.
					   SHEILA
			   Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!
			   Thou art a Murderer!  A black
			   Murderer!
80	 VILLAGE WOMEN										 80
	   restrain her.
	   SHEILA
	   cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
					   VILLAGE WOMAN #1
			   May you be consoled by their
			   suffering in the pit.
81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81
	   halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the
	   prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at
	   swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the
	   ground. This is THE PIT.
82	 ASH												 82
	   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering
	   what they have in store for him.
83	 SHEILA											   83
	   stares at him in hatred.
84	 THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH								84
	   eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red.
					   DUKE HENRY
			   You sir, are not one of my
			   vassals.  Who are you?
					   ASH
			   Who wants to know?
					   DUKE HENRY
			   I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
			   Lord of the Northlands and leader
			   of its people.
					   ASH
			   You ain't leadin' but two things
			   now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack
			   left town.
85	 A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS			    85
	   address the doomed men:
					   ARTHUR
			   There is an Evil that has awakened
			   in this land.  And whilst my
			   people fight for their very souls
			   against it, you, Duke Henry the
			   Red, wage war on us. Your people
			   are no better than the foul
			   corruption that lies in the bowels
			   of that pit!  May God have mercy
			   on your souls.
86	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN									86
	   crank a massive wench.  Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid
	   slides back, revealing a dark hole.  The Pit.
87	 FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT					 87
	   a echoed wailing rises up.
88	 ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS						88
	   stiffen in fear.
89	 AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD					 89
					   OLD WOMAN
			   Aye. Into the pit with the
			   bloodthirsty sons of whores!
	   She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
	   CAMERA PANS TO...
90	 HENRY'S WARRIOR #1									 90
	   as he's thrown down into the pit.  He disappears into the
	   blackness.
91	 CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH						91
	   watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of
	   terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
92	 CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT							 92
	   looking down into the blackness we hear:
					   HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 (O.S.)
			   I beg of you... by all that's
			   holy!  Lower a rope!  Lower... Oh,
			   for the love of god!  no!  NO!!!
			   AIIIIIiiieee!
	   The sound of ripping and scratching.  The SHRIEK of terror is
	   cut short as...
	   A GEYSER OF BLOOD
	   erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
93	 ASH												 93
	   is frozen in fear.
					   TOWER GUARD (O.S.)
			   There!  He's escaping!
	   ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
	   jerks from the pit to...
94	 TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						94
	   making a break for it!  He's past the guards, heading for the open
	   drawbridge.
95	 THE TOWER ARCHERS									  95
	   spot him and fire arrows.
96	 ANGLE ON											 96
	   PING!  PING!
	   They bounce off the Warrior's armor.  He's makes it to the open
	   drawbridge when...
97	 ARTHUR											   97
	   pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.  ZING!  He lets it fly.
	   CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...
98	 PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						   98
	   The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to
	   a wooden post.  He dies standing.
99	 THE CROWD											99
	   Cheers.  They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners:
	   CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner
	   in line...
100	ASH												 100
	   turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
					   ASH
			   Hey, I never even saw these
			   assholes before..
	   He spins to Duke Henry the Red.
			   You gotta tell 'em you don't know
			   me. We never met. Tell him.
					   HENRY
			   I do not believe that he shall
			   listen.
101	THE WARRIORS										  101
	   grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
102	ASH												 102
	   tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul
	   water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful

	   of the rancid water. He looks about.
103	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 103
	   UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
104	ASH												 104
	   spins to a small sound.
105	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 105
	   Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.
106	ASH												 106
	   shifts his glance again.
107	A SHADOW											 107
	   rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
108	ASH												 108
	   doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.
	   Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes
	   break the surface.
109	ASH												 109
	   spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around,
	   he is confronted by...
	   A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
	   It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's
	   face!
110	CLOSER											   110
	   Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It
	   jerks like a marionette as it advances.
111	ASH SCREAM										    111
	   and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to
	   scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
112	THE DEADITE'S HAND									 112
	   clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
113	DOWN ANGLE ON ASH									  113
	   He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.
114	ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS			   114
	   hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.
115	THE PIT - THE DEADITE								   115
	   grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.
116	ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA								  116
	   shouts for Ash's death.
117	THE PIT - ASH'S FACE								    117
	   The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.
118	LONG SHOT - ASH									    118
	   is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
119	THE DEADITE										   119
	   races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a
	   kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
120	ASH												 120
	   cries out in pain.
121	ASH'S LEGS										    121
	   cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He
	   flips the beast.
122	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 122
	   rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd
	   with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
123	THE DEADITE										   123
	   grabs Ash by the throat.
124	THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH								124
	   is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
125	THE DEADITE										   125
	   advances.
126	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 126
	   shouts down at Ash.
127	THE PIT - ASH										 127
	   trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts
	   backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints
	   to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an
	   object falling at him through the glare above.
128	THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION							   128
	   tumbling downward.  Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its
	   blade of steel.  Ash's Excalibur!
129	ASH - SLOW MOTION									  129
	   summons his strength and leaps upward.
130	LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION		   130
	   Tumbling downward...
131	HIGH ANGLE- ASH									    131
	   ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars
	   past CAMERA.
132	LONG SHOT - SLOW MOTION								 132
	   Ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw.
133	ASH'S STUMP										   133
	   snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!
134	ASH WITH HIS CHAINSAW								   134
	   He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.
					   ASH
			   Come on, you blasted piece of--
	   He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
	   VERRROOOOOOM!!
135	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS				   135
	   gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw.  Blue exhaust billows up from
	   the pit.
136	THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE						 136
	   lunges at Ash.
137	DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW								  137
	   Buzzzzz!!
138	ASH												 138
	   is splattered with black bile.
139	THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND							   139
	   flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast.
140	CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND							   140
	   as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below.
141	ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND				  141
	   flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken
	   spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks
	   and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the
	   hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.
142	THE PIT - ASH										 142
	   raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite
	   hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
143	CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH								   143
	   Ash decapitates the beast.
144	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS				  144
	   stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this
	   guy's guts and style.
145	THE LAST REMNANTS									  145
	   of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
146	ASH												 146
	   climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges
	   from the earthen wall before him.
147	ASH												 147
	   slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it
	   back into the water.
148	ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS							148
	   gasp as...
	   THUMP!
149	ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM									 149
	   comes up, over the edge of the pit.  Followed by... THUMP!  Ash's
	   bloody hand.  Then his bruised face.  Covered in the black blood
	   of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.
	   Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
					   ASH
			   All right now. Who wants to be
			   next?  Who wants some.
150	GOLD TOOTH										    150
	   look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
					   ASH
			   You want some more?  Huh?!
	   Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out
	   to Henry.
					   ASH
			   Now climb on those horses and get
			   out of here.
151	HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS							   151
	   quickly mount horses.
					   ARTHUR
			   Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
152	ASH												 152
	   slaps Henry's horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYUP NOW!!  HYAAAH!
153	THE STUNNED CROWD									  153
	   parts allowing...
154	HENRY AND HIS WARRIORS								  154
	   to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom.
155	ARTHUR											   155
	   stares at Ash with hatred.
					   ARTHUR
			   For that, I shall see you dead.
156	ASH												 156
	   removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and
	   turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
					   ASH
			   This is my boomstick. It's a
			   twelve gauge, double barreled
			   Remington pump. Next one of you
			   primitives touch me...
157	ASH SPINS,										    157
	   pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has
	   spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit
	   on the forgotten chain.
	   The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving
	   the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
158	ANGLE ON											 158
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it
	   summersaulting down into the pit.
159	THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST							    159
	   echoes off the mountains like distant thunder.
160	SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD				   160
	   look to Ash in reverence.

161	ASH												 161
	   twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH,
	   WHOOSH...  and holsters it.
					   ASH
			   Bring me your hoo do man.
162	EXT. BLACKBIRDS									    162
	   fly from a barren tree.
163	SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS						   163
	   It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly
	   past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing...
164	EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					  164
	   A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each
	   twenty feet tall.  The remains of an ancient temple.  In the
	   center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire.  As old Woman
	   stirs a cauldron atop the flames.  Nearby, Arthur converses with
	   his four Lieutenants.
165	EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT							165
	   CLOSE UP - ASH
	   opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner
	   has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.  He waves
	   it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet
	   on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
166	ASH AND SHEILA										166
	   sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages
	   Ash's wounds.
167	SHEILA											   167
	   is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
					   SHEILA
			   I pray thee to forgive me.  I
			   believed thee one of Henry's men.
	   She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
					   ASH
			   First you wanta kill me, now ya
			   wanna kiss me.
	   He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
					   ASH
			   Lady, just leave me alone.
					   SHEILA
			   I'm sorry m'lord. Please
			   understand... T'is a cruel time
			   for us. The Wisemen say you are
			   the promised one. Our only hope
			   against the darkness that has
			   descended on this land.
					   ASH
			   They're mistaken.
	   She stares deeply into his eyes.
					   SHEILA
			   I think not.  I feel that there
			   is reason for your being here.
			   It is no accident.
166	WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN				  167
	   approach.  They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from
	   Ash.
					   ASH
			   Well what is it?  Can you send me
			   back or not?
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Only the Necronomicon has the
			   power.  A power which we both
			   require. It contains passages that
			   can dispel the Evil from this
			   place and return you to your time.
					   ASH
			   The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's
			   the thing that got me here.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   It is in a place far from here.
			   It can only be retrieved by the
			   Promised one. Other Warriors have
			   tried.  Their widows grieve still.
			   We have waited long years for you.
			   Out only hope is the Necronomicon.
			   Thou must undertake to quest for
			   it.  Alone must thou travel to
			   a distant cemetery. There thou
			   shalt find it.
					   ASH
			   Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm
			   goin' is home.
	   A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
169	DOGS												169
	   around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
170	ASH AND SHEILA										170
	   turn to see...
171	THE OLD WOMAN										 171
	   now standing too close to the fire.  Her robes ignites.  She does
	   not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir
	   the caldron.
172	ASH												 172
	   His haw drops.  He slowly stands as...
173	THE BURNING WOMAN									  173
	   spins sharply to him.  Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL DIE!
	   Her eyes are bone white.  She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
	   Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by
	   invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal
	   snarl. With two voice at once;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE
			   NECRONOMICON.  WE SHALL FEAST UPON
			   YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
			   MAN!
174	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									174
	   collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in
	   the dust.
175	CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA		 175
	   Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open!  A nasty grin forms
	   on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen
	   approach.
176	WISEMAN JOHN										  176
	   kneels and reaches for her.
177	ASH'S HAND										    177
	   clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
					   ASH
			   It's a trick.  Get an axe.

178	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									178
	   awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK.  In a
	   frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and
	   rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
179	PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY							    179
	   With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one
	   of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two
	   warriors beneath it.
180	A GIGANTIC STONE									   180
	   topples the next stone.
	   BOOM!
	   Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!
	   Like giant dominoes, they fall.
181	ASH												 181
	   watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...
182	ANGLE ON											 182
	   The gigantic falling stones coming right at SHEILA!
183	THE FALLING STONE'S P.O.V. - SHEILA					    183
	   She SCREAMS!
184	SHEILA'S P.O.V. - THE FALLING STONES					   184
	   coming toward CAMERA.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
185	ASH												 185
	   does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the
	   stone's deadly path.
186	ASH AND SHEILA										186
	   rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.
187	CLOSE SHOT - ASH									   187
	   rolls into frame and glances up to see...
188	THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN						   188
	   rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK!
189	WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN				 189
	   latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the
	   ground.
190	ASH												 190
	   rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
191	ANGLE ON											 191
	   The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
192	EXT. WITHIN THE TEMPLE RUINS - PAPER MACHE STONE			 192
	   THE POSSESSES WOMAN
	   SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH!  The multi-ton stone crushes her
	   legs to paste.  Her legs are pinned but still she battles on,
	   clutching Ash about his throat!
193	ASH												 193
	   gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of
	   the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.
194	POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION					194
	   Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an
	   impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
195	ASH												 195
	   grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the
	   monster's oversized throat.  She chokes.
196	GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS					    196
	   grab the beast and pull it off of Ash.  Arthur comes to meet
	   them.  He carries a double-bladed battle axe.
197	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									197
	   vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   The Evil lives.  Slay me and ten
			   will rise to take my place.  All

	   CHOP!
198	IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE								  198
	   is brought down upon her throat.  The possessed body flails and
	   spasm beneath the Warrior's grip.
199	THE HEAD											 199
	   rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet.  It's eyes pop open!
					   POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD
			   ---DIE!
200	ARTHUR											   200
	   grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness.  The
	   head sails away as the laughter receded.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Now.  Will thou quest for the
			   Necronomicon?
201	CLOSE ON ASH										  201
	   He considers.
202	INT. CASTLE - BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY				   202
	   Ash and the blacksmith step into the shop.
203	ASH												 203
	   points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.
204	THE BLACKSMITH										204
	   pounds upon the hand armor, modifying it.
205	SHEILA											   205
	   knits a grey woolen garment as she watches Ash.
206	BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY							  206
	   THE BLACKSMITH
	   attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand.
207	ASH												 207
	   tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a
	   ratchet like device.
208	ASH												 208
	   extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.
	   WHOOSH!  CLANG!
209	SHEILA											   209
	   gasps.
210	ASH'S SPRING-DRIVEN IRON HAND							210
	   SNAPS open with great force.
211	ANGLE ON											 211
	   WHOOSH CLANG!
	   ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND
	   clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron
	   goblet.
212	CLOSE ON ASH										  212
	   He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
213	EXT. CASTLE TURRET - NIGHT							   213
	   ASH
	   stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with
	   apprehension.  The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears
	   behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent
	   cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around
	   her.  Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one
	   another and kiss.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
214	EXT. LANDSCAPE OF CRACKED GROUND 1500MM LENS - DAY		    214
	   Arthur's castle in the distance.  In the foreground, five men

	   on horseback appear over a ridge, thundering toward us. Their
	   long wool capes billowing up behind them in the wind.
215	CLOSER ON RIDERS - TRUCKING SHOT						  215
	   Arthur and Wiseman John ride, flanked by two of Arthur's
	   Warriors.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
	   ASH
	   He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army
	   that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.  His chainsaw
	   juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.  Ash's cape
	   billows as he rides.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
216	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									216
	   The Horsemen wind down a trail.  Suddenly the horses rear up.
	   The men gain control of the frightened steeds.
					   ASH
			   What's going on?
	   ARTHUR
	   points to...
217	THE TRAIL THAT LIES BEFORE THEM						   217
	   It disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits
	   an eerie whistling.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   This is the edge of the land ruled
			   by the Dark Spirit. This path will
			   lead you to an unholy place. A
			   cemetery. There, the Necronomicon
			   awaits.
218	ASH												 218
	   anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
219	THE TWO WARRIORS									   219
	   finish placing saddlebags of water and food onto...
	   ASH'S HORSE
	   which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves.
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Lord Arthur, he is supplied.  Now
			   I beg of you, let us leave this
			   foul place.
					   ARTHUR
			   A moment.
220	WISEMAN JOHN										  220
	   moves close to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   As thou removest the Book from
			   it's cradle, you must recite these
			   words.  Clatoo, verata, Nicto.
					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Repeat them.
					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.
					   WISEMAN #1
			   Again.
					   ASH
			   I got it.  I got it.  I know your
			   damn words. All right?  Now you get
			   this straight: I get the book,
			   you send me back. That's the deal.
			   After that I'm history.
	   Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
221	ARTHUR AND WISEMAN JOHN								 221
	   watch as Ash disappears.
222	IN A SEA OF MIST									   222
	   The sound of THUNDEROUS HOOFS.  A form materializes out of the
	   fog:  It is Ash.
223	CLOSER ON ASH										 223
	   He whips the horse.
					   ASH
			   HAAAAAA!
224	ANGLE ON ASH										  224
	   He gallops past.  CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick
	   fog.
									   FADE OUT.
225	EXT. TRAIL'S ENTRANCE TO WOODS						    225
	   ASH
	   rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail
	   leading into a thick forest.
226	EXT. WOODS										    226
	   LONG SHOT - ASH
	   rides slowly on through the darkening woods.
227	CLOSER ON ASH										 227
	   He hears a sound and look to...
228	A SECTION OF WOODS									 228
	   A branch SCRAPING against the bark of a tree.
229	ASH												 229
	   hears a woman's soft laughter.  He glance to...
230	A BUBBLING BROOK									   230
	   and nothing more.
231	THE EVIL FORCE P.O.V.								   231
	   powers through the woods toward Ash.
232	ASH												 232
	   kick his steed and bolts.
233	THE EVIL FORCE										233
	   sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity.
234	ASH												 234
	   frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which
	   jut from the ground.
235	THE EVIL FORCE										235
	   rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks.  It
	   burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash.
236	ASH												 236
	   jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He
	   gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third,
	   he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.  He falls hard to
	   the mud as the horse gallops off.
	   He groggily stands and stumbles onward.
237	THE EVIL FORCE										237
	   follows Ash down a wooded trail.
238	ASH												 238
	   running for...
239	EXT. WOODEN SHED									   239
	   a grain storage house in the clearing ahead.
240	ASH												 240
	   comes upon the shed's door.  Locked.  He heaves his body against
	   it but it won't give.
241	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						241
	   A log, that serves as the door's bolt, holds fast.
242	THE EVIL FORCE										242
	   emerges from over the ridge.
243	ASH												 243
	   unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.  He slings the chainsaw
	   from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.  Click.
	   He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT
	   that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.  He thrusts out his
	   arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!
244	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						244
	   The blade bites into the log that bolts the door.
245	THE EVIL FORCE										245
	   draws closer.
246	INT. SHED											246
	   CLOSE ON CHAINSAW BLADE
	   halfway through the log.  Sawdust flies.
247	EXT. SHED											247
					   ASH
			   Come on!  Come on!
	   The chainsaw dies. He jerks out his arm to restart it. Putt.
	   Putt.
					   ASH
			   Blasted piece of junk!
248	THE EVIL FORCE										248
	   draws closer.
249	ASH												 249
	   delivers a mighty kick to the door.
250	INT. SHED											250
	   ANGLE ON DOOR
	   The partially cut log gives way.  Ash tumbles into the storage
	   shed. He slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the
	   log across the latch, re-bolting it.
251	THE EVIL FORCE										251
	   Hammers at the door of the Shed.
	   BANG!
252	INT. SHED											252
	   A terrified Ash braces his back against the door.
	   BANG!
	   Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of the door shudder
	   behind Ash.
253	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  253
	   It cracks.
254	ASH												 254
	   presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying
	   that whatever it out there, won't get in.
	   BANG!  Splinters fly.
255	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  255
	   BOOM!  The crack widens.
256	THE DOOR FRAME										256
	   behind Ash begins to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
257	ASH												 257
	   begins to SCREAM.  And the BANGING halts.
258	LONG SHOT - INT. SHED								   258
	   All is quiet.  Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence.  And
	   that's when it hits.  LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE!
	   Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
	   the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare.
259	INT. SHED - SAM-O-CAM - INTERVOLOMETER					 259
	   TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR
	   as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil
	   Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the
	   Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors,
	   taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors
	   as he flies through the air.
260	EXT. SHED - SIDE SHOT								   260
	   The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams
	   flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal
	   wave.
261	EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED								  261
	   It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the
	   other doors.  The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to
	   the ground in a stack.
262	THE EVIL FORCE										262
	   with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods.
263	EXT. SHED- DUSK									    263
	   LOOKING DOWN UPON - THE STACKS OF DOORS.
	   All is quiet.  We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob
	   turns slightly.  The door swings upward and opens... revealing
	   a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self
	   up.

	   He beholds...
264	EXT. ABANDONED MILL									264
	   An empty place of stone and wood.  Driven by the wind, the
	   Mill's giant grinding wheel slowly turns with a squeak.
265	INT. MILL											265
	   ASH
	   enters the Mill.
					   ASH
			   Anybody here?!
	   The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his
	   breath.
					   ASH
			   This place'll do for the night.
			   Get the book in the morning.
266	INT. MILL - THREE SHOTS - INTERVOLOMETER				    266
	   Shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls.
267	ASH												 267
	   peers through the window.
268	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT THE SUN - DAY					    268
	   a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill.  The wind
	   kicks up.
269	INT. MILL											269
	   ASH
	   listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force
	   of the gale.
270	THE WOODEN SHUTTERS									270
	   on the window quietly KNOCK.  Ash shivers and rubs his arms for
	   warmth.
					   ASH
			   Damn this cold.
271	ASH												 271
	   looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
272	GASOLINE											 272
	   pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
273	ASH												 273
	   lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the
	   flame for warmth.
					   ASH
			   'least I won't freeze to death.
	   He turns to a tiny sound.
274	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    274
	   behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps
	   past.

275	ASH												 275
	   spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
	   BLAMITY-BLAM!
	   The window is ripped away in a shower of glass.
276	ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW				    276
	   Only the night woods.  The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping
	   down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just
	   a tree branch swaying in the wind.
277	ASH												 277
	   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a
	   crack.
278	ASH'S EYEBALL										 278
	   through the crack in the door.
279	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND						   279
	   CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.  There is
	   movement.
280	LONG SHOT - EXT. MILL								   280
	   The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
	   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
	   breaking.
282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE								   282
	   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
	   Ash.
283	A STARTLED ASH										283
	   leaps aside just in time.
284	ASH												 284
	   snags the horse's reigns.
					   ASH
			   Easy, boy.
	   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
	   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
285	ASH'S P.O.V.  THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR				  285
	   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
286	EXT. MILL											286
	   ASH
	   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the
	   Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
287	INT. MILL											287
	   ASH
	   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
	   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
	   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
	   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							  288
	   Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.  From the eight
	   pieces of mirror spring...
289	EIGHT TINY ASHES									   289
	   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror
	   fragments and land on the floor.
290	ASH												 290
	   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291
	   grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they
	   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
292	ASH												 292
	   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
	   stove pipe.
293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
	   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another
	   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
294	ASH												 294
	   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
	   off.
295	THE TINY ASHES										295
	   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the
	   shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
296	ASH												 296
	   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
297	TINY ASH #1										   297
	   is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry
	   him.
298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298
	   a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it
	   WHOOSHES past.
	   FA-THONG!
299	THE FORK											 299
	   skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
300	ASH												 300
	   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
	   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.
	   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
	   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.
301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
	   is pushed off a high shelf.
	   CLANG!
302	IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD								  302
	   and spills slippery grease about the floor.
303	ASH												 303
	   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
	   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the
	   bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
	   path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting
	   needles jutting from it.
304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH									  304
	   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
	   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks
	   the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little
	   imps.
305	TINY ASH #2										   305
	   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...
306	ASH												 306
	   has seen him.  He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash
	   #2 into the stove's fire.
					   ASH
			   Ooops.
307	TINY ASH #2										   307
	   is burned alive.
308	ASH												 308
	   glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.
309	TINY ASH #3										   309
	   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic
	   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises
	   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
	   RIP!!
310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
	   through Ash's shoe.
311	ASH												 311
	   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place
	   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
	   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
	   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
	   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
	   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
312	ASH												 312
	   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
	   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5								    313
	   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
	   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his
	   nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for
	   air.  As he inhales...
315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6								   315
	   is released.
316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN					   316
	   He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form
	   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
317	ASH												 317
	   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks
	   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his
	   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
	   avail.
	   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
	   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
	   to a chair.  He goes pale.
					   ASH
			   Nasty little thing's inside me.
	   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
			   Well let's see how you like a
			   little hot water!
	   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
	   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle
	   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
	   ASH
	   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his
	   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.
318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION				  318
	   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
	   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
319	ASH												 319
	   watches in horror as...
320	THE TINY FIGURE									    320
	   squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.  The
	   Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
	   iron hand swings at him.
321	THE IRON HAND										 321
	   connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
322	ASH												 322
	   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But
	   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
	   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
	   the opened vice.
323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
	   cranks the vice's handle.
324	THE VICE											 324
	   tightens around Ash's head.  Trapped, he looks to...
325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
	   rummaging through a wooden toolbox.  It comes upon a crude wooden
	   punch.
326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED					   326
	   stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.  But Ash expertly dodges each
	   stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb
	   is super fast motion.
327	ASH												 327
	   with is head still wedged in the vice.
					   ASH
			   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS								   328
	   has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose.  He emits
	   a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
					   ASH
			   Soon as I get out of this thing
			   I... YIEEEE!!
	   THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
	   dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
					   ASH
			   No!  Not the teeth!
	   YANK!
329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
	   jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for
	   his inspection.  It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him.
	   The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.  It
	   scurries from view.
330	ASH'S HEAD										    330
	   struggling in the grip of the vice.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell are ya!?
331	THE EVIL HAND										 331
	   grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
					   ASH
			   I can't see ya!!
	   HIS EVIL HAND
	   raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the
	   right half of his body.
					   ASH
			   No, no--not the poke--
	   SSSSsssssssss!
332	ASH												 332
	   jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up
	   his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
	   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches
	   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE
	   BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!
333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT				    333
	   It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH.  Beneath it, a mouth and nose
	   begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
334	ASH												 334
	   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA
	   follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark
	   woods.
335	EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT						   335
	   ASH
	   staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the

	   brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this
	   protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, it's growing bigger!
336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
	   It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
	   his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
	   incarnate.
	   He is now a man with two heads!
337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
	   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
	   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
338	THE BAD ASH HEAD									   338
	   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD									  339
	   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
	   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we
	   see a terrifying sight:
341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
	   sprout from Ash's body!
342	A LEG											    342
	   rips out of his stomach.  Another foot POPS out from his back.
343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
	   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
	   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands
	   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
	   He literally splits into two.
344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
	   When it's over, there are two ASHES.
	   GOOD ASH and...
345	BAD ASH.											 345
	   They square off beneath the moonlight.
346	HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES							   346
	   circle one another like wolves.
					   GOOD ASH
			   What... are you?  Are you me?
					   BAD ASH
			   WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You
			   sound like a jerk!
					   GOOD ASH
			   Why are you doing this?!
					   BAD ASH
			   Wanna know?  'cause the answers
			   easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,
			   and yer...
347	EVIL ASH											 347
	   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face
	   as he sings:
					   EVIL ASH
			   ...Little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little good--
348	EVIL ASH											 348
	   the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing
	   at his nose.
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet.
349	WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN						   349
	   blown backwards into a double backflip.
350	EVIL ASH'S BODY									    350
	   slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,
	   quite dead.
351	GOOD ASH											 351
	   clutching the smoldering shotgun.
					   GOOD ASH
			   Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the
			   gun.
352	LONG SHOT - ASH									    352
	   staring down at the body of his evil self.
					   ASH
			   I know better than to bury you
			   whole.
353	EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					    353
	   The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes
	   of lightning.  The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body
	   of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill.
	   The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
	   WHOOSSH-WHOOSH!
354	MONTAGE SEQUENCE:									  354
	   Ash's hand light a torch.
355	FRIGHTENED BATS FLY									355
	   from the base of the windmill.
356	CHAINS ARE PULLED TIGHT								 356
	   across the body of Evil Ash to secure it.
	   CLICK. SNAP. CLINK.
357	THE CHAINSAW										  357
	   is switched on.  It spews a plume of blue exhaust.
358	ASH												 358
	   falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil
	   twin.  He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly
	   task.
359	EXT. NIGHT SKY - BLOOD RED CLOUDS						 359
	   float past the moon.  We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw.
360	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT								  360
	   ASH
	   with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.
	   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of
	   an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
	   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
	   as he digs a grave.
					   ASH
			   Now you see what's what.  Man's
			   body is his own personal property.
			   Don't anybody try to take that
			   away from him.
361	ASH												 361
	   finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves
	   the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.
362	INT. GRAVE - THE EVIL ASH HEAD						    362
	   It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It
	   croaks;
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   You'll never get that Book. I will
			   come back for you.
					   ASH
			   Hey, what's that you got on your
			   face?
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   Huh?
363	CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD							   363
	   It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a
	   shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it.
364	EVIL ASH HEAD - P.O.V. - EYEMO						    364
	   as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
365	ASH												 365
	   buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his
	   head;
					   ASH
				   (muttering under his
				    breath)
			   Rest in pieces.
366	ASH												 366
	   backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the
	   grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
367	THE GRAVEYARD										 367
	   in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel
	   GROANS in the gale.
					   ASH
			   This must be it. The cemetery.
368	ASH												 368
	   moves toward the cemetery.
369	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY							  369
	   In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
370	ASH												 370
	   draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him.
	   He glances down to...
371	ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL					   371
	   sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye
	   sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw
	   bone drops open with a squeak.
372	CLOSE ON ASH										  372
	   His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...
373	THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER			 373
	   backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and
	   shadow.
374	ASH												 374
	   arrives at the foot of the massive stone.
375	UNDERCRANKED - THE STONE								375
	   Atop it sits... THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.
376	CAMERA PANS REVEALING...								376
	   A SECOND BOOK OF THE DEAD!
377	CAMERA PANS AGAIN REVEALING...						    377
	   A THIRD!
378	CAMERA RACES BACK AT SUPER SPEED TO REVEAL:				 378
	   THREE BOOK OF THE DEAD!!!
379	A BAFFLED ASH										 379
	   steps close.
					   ASH
			   Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said
			   anything about that. Ha!  That
			   Wiseman was so busy fillin' me
			   fulla his secret words and phrases
			   and, and, his... bullshit, he
			   forgot to mention anything about
			   that.  Like do I take all of 'em
			   of one or 'em, or what?  Well...
	   He reaches for the first book and opens it.
380	ANGLE ON											 380
	   WHOOOOOOSH!!!
	   To reveal a black hole.  SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of
	   the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
381	CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION				381
	   dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book.
382	ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE								 382
	   Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing
	   stronger.
383	ASH'S HAND - PUPPET									383
	   is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.
384	LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET								  384
	   Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
385	ASH'S PUPPET HEAD									  385
	   stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
386	ASH PUPPET										    386
	   A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of
	   the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.
387	INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH							    387
	   His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to
	   normal.
					  ASH
			   Woah.  Wrong book.
	   He turns to study...
388	THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS								 388
	   ASH
	   tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it
	   is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses
	   the other.
389	THE BOOK											 389
	   moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
					   ASH
			   Huh.
	   Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
390	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET							390
	   Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book.  The Book
	   flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA
	   like a bat!
391	BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED				  391
	   Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
392	THE BATBOOK										   392
	   shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
	   The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
393	ASH												 393
	   pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's
	   pedestal.
394	ASH												 394
	   faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind
	   kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
395	CLOSE ON BOOK										 395
	   It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face!  Two empty
	   eye sockets stare out from it.  This is the Book of the Dead...
396	ASH												 396
	   bristles in fear.
					   ASH
			   Okay.   The words.  Say the words.
			   KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh...
			   Necta... uh... Nectar...
			   Necktie... uh...
	   He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
					   ASH
			   KLATOO... VERATA...
			   NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...
	   He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember.
	   The wind stops.  It seems to have worked.  He looks about with
	   growing confidence.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the
	   soundtrack.
397	LONG SHOT - CEMETARY								    397
	   ASH
	   A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by
	   one are thrust from the earth.
					   ASH
			   Hey, wait a minute. Everything's
			   cool!  I said the words!  I did!
398	EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT									398
	   A violent storm in the distance.  Lightning flashes.
399	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							399
	   A DOOR
	   blows open revealing Wiseman John.  He looks at the gathering
	   storm with foreboding.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Something is amiss.
400	HORSES IN THE CASTLE GROUNDS							 400
	   WHINNIE in hear. Sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully
	   out at the storm.
401	EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT								   401
	   ASH runs for his horse, clutching the Necronomicon.
402	A BONEY HAND										  402
	   rips up from a grave and grabs his leg!
403	ASH												 403
	   falls.
404	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD								    404
	   is knocked from Ash's hand.
405	ASH												 405
	   reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground
	   and clutches his face.
406	THE FIRST SKELETON HAND								 406
	   digs into Ash's mouth.  It jerks his face sideways to show
	   him...
407	A GROUP OF SIX ROTTED ARMS							   407
	   that rip from the ground!
408	THE SKELETAL HANDS									 408
	   toss Ash to...
409	THE ROTTED ARMS									    409
	   grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock.  Two of the six arms try
	   to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved
	   at him.  Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his
	   face toward the skeleton hands.
410	THE SKELETON HANDS									 410
	   curl boney fingers, clenching them into fists.
					   ASH
			   No.. no more...
	   The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
					   ASH
			   Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!
411	THE SKELETAL FINGERS								    411
	   last out and snag Ash's tongue between their boney pincers,
	   shutting Ash up.  With his tongue held, he tries to speak again,
	   but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up.  Both
	   hands work double-time at slapping him.
412	UNDERCRANKED - ASH									  412
	   His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They
	   pull his ears and gouge his eyes.
413	ASH												 413
	   open his mouth wide with in a SCREAM!
414	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETON ARM					   414
	   The boney fist is thrust into Ash's screaming mouth up to the
	   skeleton's boney elbow.
415	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EYES						   415
	   They bulge as he swallow the arm.
416	STOP MOTION ANIMATION								   416
	   A ROTTED ARM
	   rips through the ground, punching Ash in the stomach.
417	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETAL ARM					   417
	   ASH
	   jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to
	   the ground.
418	THE ARMS											 418
	   reach for him, but he is too fast.  He stamps on one of the
	   skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.
					   ASH
				   (in a snarl)
			   Keep you damn filthy bones outta
			   my mouth.
	   SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea
	   of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the
	   Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over
	   another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
419	ASH CLIMBS										    419
	   atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...
420	EXT. CEMETARY - OLD OAK TREE							 420
	   The burial site of Evil Ash. A bolt of lightning strikes the
	   grave marker.
421	EVIL ASH'S BURIAL MARKER								421
	   is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the
	   earth.
422	EVIL ASH'S BODY PARTS								   422
	   fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided,
	   decayed version of EVIL ASH!
423	EXT. MILL - NIGHT									  423
	   ASH
	   stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip
	   from the earth and shriek as they come back to life!
424	A FEARFUL ASH										 424
	   kicks the horse and rides off.
425	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT							425
	   ASH ON HORSEBACK
	   galloping back the way he came. In the distance we see the
	   cemetery. More bodies arise from the ground.
426	EXT. WOODS - ASH - NIGHT								426
	   Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.
					   ASH
			   I'm through bein' their garbage
			   boy.  I did my part of the
			   bargain.
	   He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.
			   Now they owe me.  Like in the
			   deal.  I want back.
	   He whips his horse...
			   HA!  GIIDDUP NOW!!
	   ...and rides off into the darkness.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
427	EXT. CASTLE - LONG SHOT - NIGHT						   427
	   ASH
	   A tiny figure, rides toward the castle.
428	EXT. CASTLE WALL - NIGHT								428
	   GOLD TOOTH and two guards stand atop a tower and shout down to
	   the gatekeeper.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   Open the gates. The Promised one
			   has returned!
429	EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT									429
	   THE DRAWBRIDGE
	   swings down.
430	ASH												 430
	   rides across the lowered bridge and into the torchlight of the
	   castle.
431	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							431
	   TWO WARRIORS
	   hold Ash's horse as he dismounts. There are excited shouts from
	   the villagers
					   VILLAGERS
			   The stranger has returned!  He's
			   brought the book!
432	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							432
	   ASH
	   is led to the THREE WISEMEN.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Necronomicon.  Quickly.
433	ASH												 433
	   pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you bring the Necronomicon!
434	ASH												 434
	   slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the
	   Wiseman.
					   ASH
			   Yes. It's just that...
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Just what?!
					   ASH
			   Nothing. Here
	   Ash produces the Necronomicon.
			   Now send be back. Like in the
			   deal.
435	WISEMAN JOHN										  435
	   takes the book and suddenly goes pale.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   No...I sensed something had gone
			   awry. The book's power. It's gone.
436	THE CROWD											436
	   murmurs at this bad news.
437	ASH												 437
	   suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   When you removed the Necronomicon
			   from it's cradle, did you speak
			   the words?
					   ASH
			   Yeah.  basically.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you speak the exact words?!
					   ASH
			   Well, maybe not every single
			   syllable, no.  But basically I
			   said them.  Yes.
438	WISEMAN JOHN										  439
	   bows his head, stung by this information.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed
			   us. When thou misspoke the words
			   the Army of the Dead was awoke.
					   ASH
			   Hey. We had a deal. You told me,
			   you could clean this thing up,
			   once I got you the book. You said
			   there was a passage in there that
			   could get rid of this thing and
			   send me back.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The passage is useless to us as
			   long as these evil dead walk. They
			   have a terrible desire for this
			   book. And they shall come here
			   to get it. Once in their
			   possession, the Evil shall rule
			   the Earth for one thousand
			   years...Because of you...we are
			   doomed.
					   ASH
			   You wanted the damn book. You got
			   yer book. I did my part of the
			   deal.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   We did strike a bargain. I will
			   return you to your own time as
			   promised.
					   ASH
			   Yeah. Well good. That was the
			   deal.  So uh...when do you think
			   we can...
439	ASH												 439
	   looks about at the condemned faces.
440	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE VILLAGERS							 440
	   CAMERA PANS past the doomed faces in the crowd.
					   ASH
			   I mean...when can you send me...
441	ASH												 441
	   sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed with the guilt that he's
	   doomed her.
					   ARTHUR
			   The Wisemen were fools to believe
			   that you were the Promised one.
			   That one such as you could have
			   saved us!.
442	ASH												 442
	   is solemn.
443	ARTHUR											   443
	   and the others turn away in contempt.
444	SHEILA											   444
	   moves closer.
					   SHEILA
			   I still believe that thou wilt
			   help us.
					   ASH
			   No.. They're right.  I screwed
			   up. I didn't come through for you,
			   and...  I'm sorry for it.
					   SHEILA
			   I still have faith in thee. In
			   my heart I know thou wilt still
			   succeed.
					   ASH
			   Sheila... It's over for me. I
			   don't belong here and I'm going
			   home. I didn't have what it took.
			   It's over.
	   He bows his head and moves off.
	   A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!
445	ALL HEADS											445
	   look to the sky.
446	TWO WINGED DEADITES									446
	   possessed women with bat-like wings, swoop down.
447	TEN VILLAGERS										 447
	   scream as they flee from the winged beasts.
448	WINGED DEADITE #1									  448
	   Like a delta winged F-15, it banks towards Sheila.
					   ASH
			   No!
449	ASH												 449
	   races to intercept.  He plants himself between Sheila and the
	   beast.
450	WINGED DEADITE #1 - POV								 450
	   As it swoops at Ash.
451	ASH												 451
	   opens his steel hand, then clamps it closed again on the handle
	   of his sword.
452	ASKEW ANGLE										   452
	   The immense shadow of the broad winged Deadite falls over Ash.
453	ASH												 453
	   swings his sword upward.
454	CLOSE SHOT - THE BLADE								  454
	   severs the tip of the Beast's rotted wing.
455	THE FLYING DEADITE									 455
	   shrieks in pain as it soars over Ash. No longer aerodynamically
	   sound, it crashes to the ground.
456	A GROUP OF WARRIORS									456
	   fire their arrows into the beast, pegging it to a tree.  The
	   bone white eyes of the creature darken.
457	ASH AND ARTHUR										457
	   spin to the sound of a woman's SCREAM.
458	SHEILA											   458
	   in the clutches of WINGED DEADITE #2.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Ash!  Help me!
	   The beast flies off with the fair maiden, soaring over the
	   castle wall and into the distance.
459	ASH												 459
	   shakes his fist at the receding beast.
					   ASH
			   Damn you!
460	THREE MOUNTED SCOUTS								    460
	   come riding in through the castle doors.
					   SCOUT
			   An army of the dead!  They have
			   gathered in the wilderness and
			   come this way.
					   ARTHUR
			   How far from here?
					   SCOUT
			   But two days ride.
					   ARTHUR
			   Then these winged ones are only
			   the first of them.
					   WISEMAN
			   Perhaps we should go from this
			   place while we can.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   We could be safe in the mountains.
					   WARRIORS
			   Yes!  To the mountains!  We must flee!
			   They'll take our souls!
461	ANGLE ON											 461
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   All eyes look to...
462	ASH												 462
	   who stands on a high castle wall, clutching his smoldering
	   shotgun.
					   ASH
			   Go ahead and run.  Run home and
			   cry to mama.  I'm through runnin'.
			   I stay we stay and fight.
463	ARTHUR											   463
	   takes a challenging step forward.
					   ARTHUR
			   How will we stop an army of the
			   dead at out castle walls?  How will
			   you fight that?!  With more words?
			   Most of out people have already
			   fled.  We are but forty men.
					   ASH
			   We'll get Henry the Red and his
			   men to fight with us.
					   ARTHUR
			   We shall not stand in battle,
			   alongside the likes of him. Our
			   honor will not allow it.
					   ASH
			   Then you'll die.  Honor and all.
			   Now who's with me?
464	THE CROWD											464
	   is silent as they consider Ash's words. Then from the rear, the
	   Village Blacksmith steps forward.
					   BLACKSMITH
			   I'll stand by you.
465	A WARRIOR											465
	   steps forward. Then another.
					   WARRIOR #7
			   You may count on my steel.
					   WARRIOR #8
			   And mine!
466	THE CROWD											466
	   steps forward vowing their allegiance to the cause.
467	ARTHUR											   467
	   reluctantly joins them.
468	EXT. GRAVEYARD - STOP MOTION ANIMATION - NIGHT			   468
	   EVIL ASH
	   directs teams of skeletons to dig at the graves.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Dig!  Dig faster!  I want every black
			   hearted, worm infested, son of
			   a bitch that ever died in battle!
			   We'll storm their castle and take
			   the book!  Then my lads, eternal
			   life shall by ours!
469	STOP MOTION ANIMATION - THREE SKELETONS					469
	   hoist up a stone casket from the ground and with rusted swords
	   pry it open, releasing another skeleton who stands to join their
	   ranks.
470	TWO ARMORED SKELETONS								   470
	   push a bruised Sheila to her knees before Evil Ash.
471	CLOSE ON SHEILA									    471
	   looking up to Evil Ash in fear. His boney finger comes down into
	   frame and strokes her lovely cheek.  She pulls away in
	   revulsion.
472	EVIL ASH											 472
	   looks down at her with lust.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Why ain't you a sweet little
			   thing?
	   His boney digit caresses her lips.
					   SHEILA
			   Don't touch me!  You foul thing!
					   EVIL ASH
			   Your gonna learn to live me missy.
					   SHEILA
			   The Promised one will come for
			   you.
	   SKELETAL EVIL ASH

	   yanks her to her feet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Darlin' I'm gonna save him the
			   trouble.
	   He clutches her squirming body in a boney embrace.
473	EXT. GRAVEYARD - LONG SHOT							   473
	   Silhouetted by the large full moon, Evil Ash forces his kiss
	   upon Sheila.  Around them, the skeletons sharpen their swords
	   on tombstones.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
474	EXT. VAST VISTA OF BARREN LAND - DAY					   474
	   Ash rides toward the castle of Henry the Red that can be seen
	   in the distance.
475	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    475
	   is suddenly intercepted by FOUR OF HENRY'S HORSEMEN.  They
	   surround him.
					   HENRY WARRIOR #1
			   He wears the insignia of Arthur!
					   HENRY WARRIOR #2
			   Slay him!
	   The draw their swords when...
476	HENRY THE RED										 476
	   rides up between his warriors and Ash.
					   HENRY
			   Stay your arms!
	   Henry turns to Ash.
					   HENRY
			   T'is the stranger who spared me
			   from the pit. What brings you?
					   ASH
			   The Army of the Dead.
					   HENRY
			   What of them?
					   ASH
			   They're headed towards Arthur's
			   castle. We need your help. Fight
			   with us.
					   HENRY
			   So you are a vassal of Arthur now?
			   You have taken up sides with him
			   against me.
					   ASH
			   The only side I'm takin' is the
			   one that's gonna stop those
			   things.
	   Henry laughs.
					   HENRY
			   Why should I endanger my people
			   to save my enemy?
					   ASH
			   Because after they finish with
			   Arthur they'll come after you.
			   Together, we've got a chance.
			   Besides, you owe me.
477	EXT. A CRAGGY MOUNTAIN TOP - NIGHT						477
	   EVIL ASH AND SHEILA
	   ride side by side on skeletal steeds.  Sheila lifts her black
	   veil, revealing bone white eyes, set into a face now the texture
	   of cracked leather.  She looks with admiration to...
478	EVIL ASH											 478
	   He is general of the army of Deadites. He thrusts a rusted sword
	   into the air and shouts in a gritty voice:
					   EVIL ASH
			   Who rules?!
479	WIDE SHOT - ONE HUNDRED ARMORED SKELETONS				   479
	   raise their swords into the air with a shout.
480	EXT. CASTLE - DAY									  480
	   THREE TRUMPETERS
	   stand atop the castle wall and sound their trumpets!  CAMERA PANS
	   to reveal...
481	THE 1973 DELTA 88 OLDSMOBILE							 481
	   being pulled by a team of men and horses, inside the castle
	   walls.  Ash is behind the steering wheel.
482	INT. CASTLE - BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY					    482
	   ASH AND THE BLACKSMITH
	   look under the hood of the Delta 88, parked in the Blacksmith's
	   shop.
483	THE DELTA'S ENGINE									 483
	   is shattered.
484	ASH												 484
	   frowns.
485	ASH AND THE BLACKSMITH								  485
	   pour molten iron into a large sand mold.
486	THE SAND											 486
	   is brushed away revealing gear wheels.
487	HAMMERS											  487
	   beat upon red hot iron, fashioning helicopter like rotor blades.
488	THE BLACKSMITH'S STOVE								  488
	   is lowered into the Delta's engine compartment.
489	EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY							  489
	   ASH
	   walks along, inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who
	   stand at attention. He halts before a warrior and stares hard
	   at him. The Warrior glances towards Ash.
					   ASH
			   You eyeballin' me boy?
					   WARRIOR #9
			   No, M'Lord.
					   ASH
			   I can't hear you!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   NO, M'LORD!!
					   ASH
			   You squeekin' like a mouse!  Are
			   you a mouse boy?!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   NO, M'LORD!
					   ASH
			   Where you from, mouse?!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   I hail from the village of Perth.
					   ASH
			   Only two things come from Perth:
			   steers and queers. Which are you?
490	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									490
	   ASH
	   takes charcoal from a dead fire and chips of dried cow dung.
	   He mixes them with sulfur.
491	THE BLACK POWDER									   491
	   is bound up in a small satchel and affixed to an arrow.
492	GOLD TOOTH										    492
	   lights the fuse with a torch.
493	ASH												 493
	   draws back and releases the arrow. ZING!
494	THE ARROW											494
	   imbeds in a wooden post and EXPLODES. Large pieces of wood are
	   sent flying.
495	ARTHUR'S WARRIORS									  495
	   watch in awe.
496	EXT. CASTLE LOOKOUT TOWER - DUSK						  496
	   THE CASTLE BELL

497	A WARRIOR											497
	   rides in through the castle gates screaming:
					   WARRIOR
			   They're coming!  The Deadites
			   approach!
498	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   498
	   A look of shock and fear on all the faces.  ASH comes into
	   frame.  CAMERA CRANES UP with him as he scales the ladder to
	   the lookout tower. He peers out to the darkening horizon.
499	ASH												 499
	   hears them before he sees them: The sound of clicking bones.
	   Painful moans of tortured souls, the clanging of approaching
	   armor.
500	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE HORIZON							   500
	   Fifty distant silhouettes of the Evil Dead appear on the
	   horizon.  Then fifty more.
501	EXT. BATTLEFIELD TRACKING SHOT						    501
	   THREE KILTED SKELETON SCOTSMEN

	   plays the drums upon a set of hollow skulls.
503	SKELETON #2										   503
	   takes a leg bone upon a third skeleton's ribs. A bone xylophone.
	   A bone-o-phone.
504	SKELETON #3, #4 AND #5								  504
	   blow into arm bones forming woodwind section.
505	FOUR VIKING SKELETONS								   505
	   CAMERA TRACKING with these helmeted skeletons as they march.
	   They are clad in rusting suits of armor, wielding swords and
	   spears.  Nasty grins on their faces. One hobbles past on his
	   wooden leg.
506	EVIL ASH AND SHEILA									506
	   ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill.
507	A SKELETON AND DEADITE CAPTAIN						    507
	   ride alongside Evil Ash and salute him sharply.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN
			   M'Lord!  We are positioned on both
			   fronts!
					   EVIL ASH
			   Where are they keeping my book?
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Most likely...there, in the
			   castle's keep. It would be the
			   safest place.  It is behind two
			   walls that must be taken first.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Excellent. Proceed.
508	SKELETON CAPTAIN #1									508
	   With a sweep of his arm, he waves the Army of rot.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Forward!
509	THE MACABRE MARCHING BAND							    509
	   now pound the attack beat on their drums.
510	A LINE OF DEADITES									 510
	   advance toward the castle. Some crouch behind wooden barricades
	   which they roll before them.
511	EXT. CASTLE - ATOP THE WALL							  511
	   ASH, ARTHUR AND THE WARRIORS
					   ASH
			   Arrows!
					   ARTHUR
			   Load!
512	TWELVE ARCHERS										512
	   pull back arrows on their bow strings.  Each arrow has a small
	   charge of black powder attached to it.
			   Torch boy!
513	A TORCH BOY										   513
	   runs behind the archers, lighting the fuses on each of the
	   powder charges. As the last arrow is lit....
514	ARTHUR											   514
	   looks to the approaching army.
515	THE LINE OF DEADITES								    515
	   rolls their wooden barricades closer.
516	ARTHUR											   516
	   turns to Ash for the signal.
517	ASH												 517
	   holds up a finger.  He waits.
518	TWELVE ARCHERS										518
	   strain, their bows taut with the explosive arrows.  The sound
	   of the FUSE BURNING is loud.
519	THE BURNING FUSES									  519
	   about to disappear into the powder charges.
520	ASH												 520

					   ASH
			   Fire!
					   ARTHUR
			   Fire!
521	TWELVE ARCHERS										521
	   fire a volley of smoking arrows.
522	SMOKING AND SPUTTERING ARROWS							522
	   rain down from the castle wall.
523	TWO WOODEN BARRICADES								   523
	   are hit with the explosive arrows. They explode.
524	THREE DEADITES										524
	   are pierced by the explosive arrows.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  They burst
	   apart in flames.
525	FLAMING DEADITES									   525
	   roll on the ground unable to extinguish themselves.
526	A BURNING SKELETON									 526
	   continues to advance only to collapse into a smoldering heap.
527	THE WARRIORS										  527
	   CHEER Ash in sensurround.
528	A SCOUT											  528
	   races up to Ash.
					   SCOUT
			   M'Lord!  A second division
			   approaching from the South.
529	ASH												 529
	   turns to the South.
530	A SECOND WAVE A DEADITES								530
	   approach.

	   hoist large sacks of black powder onto spoons of the catapults.
	   Their fuses are lit.
533	ASH												 533
	   gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of
	   black powder catapulting.
534	LONG SHOT - CASTLE									 534
	   Three flaming projectiles whine as they hurl over the castle
	   walls.
535	THREE FALLING SATCHELS P.O.V.'S						   535
	   CAMERA CRANING DOWN toward the skeletons as they look upward
	   in horror.
	   BOOM!  The first blast takes out a skeleton horse and rider. Bones
	   fly.
	   BOOM!  FOUR DEADITES are obliterated.
536	EVIL ASH											 536
	   turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You needn't bother.
537	EVIL ASH											 537
	   slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the
	   MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You are now my captain. I will
			   now allow anything to stop me from
			   possessing the Necronomicon. Get
			   me into that castle.
538	THE NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN								 538
	   gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting:
					   NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN
			   RAM THE GATES!
539	TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SKELETONS							 539
	   use trees as battering rams and batter the large wooden doors
	   of the castle.
	   BOOM!-BOOM!
540	INT. CASTLE - THE CASTLE DOORS						    540
	   begin to buckle beneath the hammering blows.

	   wedge logs to buttress the buckling castle doors.
543	EXT. CASTLE										   543

	   fire a volley of arrows. As they reload. Behind them...
545	A SECOND LINE OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS					  545
	   fire their arrows.
546	A VOLLEY OF DEADITES' ARROWS							 546
	   pierce five Warriors atop the castle wall. They fall.
547	INT. CASTLE										   547
	   TWO DEAD WARRIORS
	   fall to the courtyard. Villagers lift them away on stretchers.
548	ARTHUR											   548
	   shouts to Ash:
					   ARTHUR
			   Where is Henry?!
					   ASH
			   He'll be here.
					   ARTHUR
			   I think he will not. But know
			   this.  No matter how this battle
			   fares, I was wrong to think you
			   a coward.
549	EXT. CASTLE										   549
	   The battering rams rips through the doors and the army of
	   darkness pours into the courtyard.
550	A LEGLESS SKELETON									 550
	   crawls in with a knife in its teeth.
					   ARTHUR
			   They're coming in. What now?!
551	ASH												 551
	   looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance,
	   dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling
	   the door closed behind him.
552	ARTHUR											   552
	   shocked at Ash's cowardly desertion, turns to his men and
	   shouts:
					   ARTHUR
			   Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect
			   the book or God save us all!
553	THE WARRIORS										  553
	   retreat across the courtyard to rope ladders that scale the
	   parapet.
554	ARTHUR'S MEN CLIMB ATOP THE PARAPET					    554
	   The rope ladders are hastily pulled up, leaving no access.
555	INT. COURTYARD - SIX OF ARTHUR'S WARRIORS				   555
	   are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but
	   are quickly overcome.
556	EVIL SHEILA										   556
	   takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.
557	EVIL ASH											 557
	   smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower
	   just beyond the parapet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   The book shall be mine!
	   He raises his rusty sword.
			   LADDERS!
558	TWELVE EVIL DEAD									   558
	   storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as
	   large rocks rain down upon them from above.
559	TWO WARRIORS										  559
	   push away ladder #1.
560	FOUR SKELETONS ON LADDER #1							  560
	   swing away from the wall and crash to the ground.
561	TWO SKELETONS ON LADDER #2							   561
	   leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.
562	WARRIOR #2										    562
	   knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.
					   WARRIOR #2
			   We can't hold this wall much
			   longer!
563	A DEADITE ARROW									    563
	   pierces his armor and he falls to his death.
564	INT. COURTYARD										564
	   A VIKING DEADITE
	   looks up as he hears...
	   CHUG!  CHUG!  CHUG!
565	DEADITE'S P.O.V.									   565
	   THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN
	   Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron
	   beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling.
	   Behold...
566	THE DEATHCOASTER									   566
	   The stripped chaise of the Delta  88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine
	   is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and
	   rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.
567	GOLD TOOTH										    567
	   shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.
568	ASH												 568
	   is at the helm. He pulls a cord.
569	THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE						  569
	   SCREAMS to announce its birth.
570	THE VIKING DEADITE									 570
	   is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.
571	THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET						    571
	   cheer!
572	EVIL DEAD											572
	   at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...
573	THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES							573
	   slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front
	   pushes aside the halved Evil Dead.
574	ASH												 574
	   operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer
	   the craft. It's a bumpy ride.
575	WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER							 575
	   Thwop!  Thwop!  Two more skeletons bite the dust.
	   leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
576	GOLD TOOTH										    576
	   disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
	   emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
	   that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
	   the Deadites.
577	EVIL SHEILA										   577
	   leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.
					   EVIL SHEILA
			   Thou didst find me beautiful once.
					   ASH
			   Honey...You got real ugly.
578	EVIL SHEILA										   578
	   attacks with a SHRIEK!
579	ASH												 579
	   spins out his double barreled shot gun and...
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   ...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other
	   Deadites.
580	ASH												 580
	   pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the
	   craft.
581	THE DEATHCOASTER									   581
	   careens out of control.
582	ASH												 582
	   tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.
583	THE DEATHCOASTER									   583
	   flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes.
584	ASH												 584
	   picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...
585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
	   attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
	   stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil
	   Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
	   the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586
	   races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two
	   deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and
	   slices one end of it with his sword.
587	ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS							587
	   plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them.
	   Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the
	   parapet.
588	ASH												 588
	   looks to...
589	EVIL ASH											 589
	   approaching the Necronomicon.
590	ASH												 590
	   kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four
	   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
591	A FLAME ARROW										 591
	   imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming
	   dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
	   burns and SHRIEKS!
592	ASH												 592
	   watches in horror as...
593	THE FLAMES RECEED									  593
	   revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL
	   EVIL ASH!  It races at Ash with a SHRIEK.
594	ASH AND EVIL ASH									   594
	   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
	   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
	   the Necronomicon.
	   CLANG!
	   With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
595	ASH'S SWORD										   595
	   imbeds in a wooden beam.
596	EVIL ASH											 596
	   grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.
597	ASH												 597
	   grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.
598	ANGLE ON											 598
	   WHOOSH!  KLANG!  WHOOSH!  KLANG!
	   Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
599	ANGLE ON											 599
	   KLANG!
	   The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
	   of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
	   The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
	   upon the spoon of a catapult.
600	ABOVE...											 600
	   SKELETON ASH
	   swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings
	   downward, and Ash side steps it.
601	ASH												 601
	   rabbit punches CAMERA.
602	CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD								  602
	   Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.
603	ASH												 603
	   delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in
	   a circle.
604	THE SKELETON										  604
	   gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
	   over the edge.
605	ASH												 605
	   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
	   at the burning fuse.
606	EVIL ASH											 606
	   leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton
	   looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.
607	SKELETON ASH										  607
	   Behold...
	   He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now
	   battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the
	   Keep.
608	ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH								   608
					   SKELETON ASH
			   You're finished.
	   He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
					   SKELETON ASH
			   I possess the Necronomicon. I've
			   crushed your pathetic army. Now
			   I'll have my vengeance!
	   He raises his sword for the death blow...
609	THE SHRILL CALL OF BATTLE TRUMPETS						609
					   GUARD (O.S.)
			   Duke Henry's men!  They've come!
610	ASH AND THE SKELETON								    610
	   turn...
	   A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...
611	DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN					611
	   thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
	   courtyard to attack the Deadites!
612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT						  612
	   turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.
613	ASH												 613
	   has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion
	   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton
	   Ash.
614	ASH												 614
	   snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices
	   through the rope, springing the catapult.
615	THE SKELETON AND BURNING SATCHEL						  615
	   are flung over the castle wall.
616	HIGH SHOT - LOOKING DOWN AT CASTLE						616
	   THE SKELETON PROJECTILE
	   rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. The burning
	   satchel follows.
	   BOOM!  The skeleton is blown to bits in mid air.
	   A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors
	   crush the last of the Deadites.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
617	GLORIOUS BEAMS OF MORNING SUNLIGHT						617
	   streak over the horizon. Ash enters frame. He holds the
	   Necronomicon as he looks wearily out over the battlefield.
618	LONG SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING					  618
	   Smoking skeletons lay scattered. Henry and Arthur's Warriors
	   work together. They toss the deadite bones and armor into a
	   bonfire.
619	CLOSE SHOT - TWO DEADITE SKULLS						   619
	   engulfed by flames, crack in the heat.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
620	EXT. SEASHORE - ARROWHEADS - DUSK						 620
	   are dipped into the flame of a bonfire.  They ignite.
621	THE INTEGRATED ARMY OF HENRY AND ARTHUR'S MEN			    621
	   Form a row of archers.
	   They fire their flaming arrows toward the sea.
622	THE ARROWS										    622
	   strike a wooden ship that holds the body of Arthur.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure
			   we had our problems.  But in the
			   end, he was all right.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
623	EXT. SEASHORE - DUSK								    623
	   ASH AND THE OTHERS
	   watch the funeral pyre sail off.  It's flickering flames play
	   upon their faces.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
624	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							624
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Peace was made between the two
			   peoples.  And a new nation was
			   formed.  They offered my a chance
			   to stay among them and teach them.
			   A chance to lead them.  To be
			   King.  But Sheila was gone.
			   Besides, I had places to go.
	   FLAMES OF THE FIRE - CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
625	THE WISEMEN										   625
	   mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from

	   the Necronomicon.  A flask is dipped into the liquid.
	   WISEMAN JOHN
	   hands the flask of liquid to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Book tells us that each drop
			   allows a man to sleep a century.
			   Swallow six drops, and thou shalt
			   awaken in thine own time.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Yeah.  Right...
	   Ash takes the flask and studies it.
			   ...but what other choice did I
			   have?
									   DISSOLVE TO:
626	EXT. CASTLE - LONG SHOT - DAY							626
	   ASH
	   rides off.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I had to find a place to crash.
			   For a very long time.
627	EXT. CAVE - DAY									    627
	   ASH
	   with the aid of his horse, drags the Deathcoaster inside the
	   cave.
	   He sets the horse free.
					   ASH
			   YAHH!!
	   It gallops off.
628	INT. CAVE - DAY									    628
	   ASH
	   Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.  He
	   ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I locked the door.
629	INT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE								  629
	   BOOM!
	   The powder charge blows.  The cave's entrance is sealed shut
	   with an avalanche of rock.
630	INT. CAVE - DEATHCOASTER								630
	   The car headlights come on, piercing the blackness.
631	INT. DEATHCOASTER									  631
	   ASH
	   uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I closed my eyes.
	   He lets six drops fall into his mouth.  One for each century
	   he must sleep.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I took a drink.
	   Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A
	   7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I didn't know if it was day or
			   night. I started... to get
			   drowsy... And I slept...
632	ASH												 632
	   falls into a deep slumber.
									   DISSOLVE TO:

					   ASH
			   ...And dreamed.
635	THE HANDS ON ASH'S WRISTWATCH							635
	   wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse
	   photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from
	   Ash's wrist.

	   rises then sets.
637	THE MOON											 637
	   follows.

641	ICICLES											  641
	   on the ceiling of the cave melt.  The water drops down onto
	   Ash's face.  He stirs.
642	ASH												 642
	   awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the
	   Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is
	   buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs
	   at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams
	   into the hole he has created.
643	EXT. HILLSIDE										 643
	   ASH
	   climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight.

646	ASH'S P.O.V.										  646

	   CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces
	   of iron and bone.
					   ASH
			   ....I found that I had slept too

648	ASH												 648
	   is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't

                                               FIRST DRAFT

                                               October 20, 1986








     FADE IN:

     EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

     The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.

     The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, 
     dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and 
     concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its 
     aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
     kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready 
     to burst.

     EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic 
     anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- 
     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.

     On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from 
     their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch 
     over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the 
     Gotham night.

     One of them is moving.

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

     The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of 
     big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. 
     Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
     fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
     each other... with one conspicuous exception:

     A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring 
     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the 
     main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks 
     over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and 
     now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in 
     the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

                              MOM
               For God's sake, Harold, can we
               please just get a taxi??

                              DAD
               I'm trying to get a --
                     (shouting)
               TAXI!!

     Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in 
     frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.

                              JIMMY
               We're going the wrong way.

     Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys 
     them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.

                              DAD
               Put that away. We'll look like
               tourists.

     TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night 
     souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. 
     The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks 
     him off down the street and glowers at DAD.

                              DAD (cont.)
               We'll never get a cab here. Let's
               cut over to Seventh.

                              JIMMY
               Seventh is that way.

                              DAD
               I know where we are!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of 
     stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath 
     and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.

                              VOICE
               Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

     The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, 
     acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm 
     uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'

     MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then 
     move on -- pretending not to hear.

                              DERELICT
               Mister. How about it. One dollar?
                     (standing up)
               One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
               Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
               English??

     By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. 
     Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.

     They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE 
     in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand 
     brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.

     DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick 
     wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across 
     the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's 
     already searching for DAD's wallet.

     MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to 
     snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his 
     gun on JIMMY.

                              STREET PUNK
               Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
               scream.

     The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her 
     face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to 
     shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.

     The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, 
     slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down 
     on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

                              NICK
                     (emptying the wallet)
               All right. The Gold Card.
                     (tossing the credit card
                     in EDDIE's face)
               Don't leave home without it.

     A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the 
     cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct 
     CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

                              EDDIE
               Let's beat it, man. I don't like
               being up here.

                              NICK
               What, scared of heights?

                              EDDIE
               I dunno, man. After what happened to
               Johnny Gobs --

                              NICK
               Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
               walked off a roof, all right? No big
               loss.

                              EDDIE
               That ain't what I heard. That ain't
               what I heard at all.
                     (beat)
               I heard the bat got him.

                              NICK
               Gimme a break, will you? Shut up... 

                              EDDIE
               Five stories, straight down. There
               was no blood in the body.

                              NICK
               No shit. It was all over the
               pavement.

     NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the 
     roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight 
     tingle at the base of his spine... 

                              EDDIE
               There was no blood, man.
                     (beat)
               My brother says... all the bad things
               you done... they come back and
               haunt you... 

                              NICK
               Listen to this. How old are you?
               There ain't no bat.

                              EDDIE
               My brother's a priest, man.

                              NICK
               No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
               Now shut up.
                     (conclusively)
               There ain't no bat.

     As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the 
     opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away... 
     where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is 
     dropping slowly, implacably, into frame... 

                              EDDIE
               You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
               that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

                              NICK
               Do you want this money or don't
               you? Now shut up! Shut up --

     BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of 
     BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS 
     DROP.

     Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a 
     BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.

     EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his 
     throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK 
     FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS: 
     GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.

     NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.

     And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate, 
     menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval 
     yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... 

     NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure 
     is knocked bodily to the roof.

     Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He 
     whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --

                              NICK (cont.)
               I'm gettin' outta here.

     -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a 
     strange, pre-verbal squeal... 

     ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, 
     NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

     Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters 
     out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of 
     the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches 
     for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to 
     the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.

     EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face 
     drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes 
     out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --

     -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --

     -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a 
     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, 
     weightless puppet.

     THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES 
     NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES 
     past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... 

     A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches 
     forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming 
     now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming 
     figure of the BAT at his heels... 

     ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against 
     the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He 
     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.

     Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he 
     could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling 
     on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to 
     pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails... 

     THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with 
     supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.

                              NICK (cont.)
               Don't kill me... don't kill me... 

     When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is 
     standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at 
     arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.

     The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:

                              BATMAN
               I won't kill you. I want you to do
               me a favor.

     NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

     He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where 
     BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own 
     stricken face.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Tell your friends. Tell all your
               friends.

     NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves 
     him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, 
     without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE 
     ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.

     Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over... 
     finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

     NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow 
     globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

     An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM. 
     HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find 
     the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT, 
     addressing a crowd from behind his podium.

                              DENT
               ... it is no longer enough to go
               after the small-time punks and petty
               criminals who infest the streets of
               Gotham City. Crime and corruption
               must be attacked at the root!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. 
     They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled 
     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're 
     going to enjoy this.

     Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling 
     water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- 
     the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has 
     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.

     The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.

     ANGLE ON DENT

                              DENT
               If elected, my first act as district
               attorney will be to return an
               indictment against Boss Carl
               Grissom!

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. 
     Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place 
     reeks of money.

     In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.
     Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle 
     with extraordinary finesse.

     In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, 
     with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.

                              DENT
                     (on the TV screen)
               Together we can make Gotham city a
               safe place for decent people to live
               and work and play.

     THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, 
     turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck 
     sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the 
     middle.

                              JACK NAPIER
               Decent people shouldn't live here.
               They'd be much happier someplace
               else.

     JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to 
     Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost 
     feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his 
     appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.

     He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA 
     HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides 
     over in her negligee and snuggles up.

                              ALICIA
               Anything new?

                              JACK
               The usual gas. If this clown could
               lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
               had to kill him by now.

     ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She 
     begins knotting it playfully about his neck.

                              ALICIA
               If Grissom knew about us... he
               might kill you.

     JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts 
     back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a 
     nearby vanity.

                              JACK
               Don't think so, angel. I'm too
               valuable. That's the way I've
               planned it.
                     (pause)
               And besides, he doesn't know.

     JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands 
     in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted 
     hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.

                              ALICIA
               You look just fine, Jack.

     He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

                              JACK
               ... I didn't ask.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham 
     Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of 
     activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

     EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. 
     Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE 
     MEDIC.

                              MEDIC
               That one there won't say a word. The
               other one's raving his head off.

                              ECKHARDT
               Variety, huh? The spice of life.

     At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
     thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
     Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
     PATROLMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               They found him hugging a drainpipe.
               He was scared to come off the roof.

                              KNOX
               Great, but tell me: is this another
               you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
               the third one this week.

                              PATROLMAN
                     (testily)
               I dunno. What's "what"?

                              KNOX
               Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
               for a commendation.

     KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and 
     saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.

                              ECKHARDT
               Oh Christ, it's Knox.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, gents. This anything I should
               know about?

                              ECKHARDT
               Nothing out of the routine.

     At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
     fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.

                              NICK
               A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
               He wanted me to do him a favor...!

     KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade 
     disgusted looks.

                              KNOX
               No offense, boys, but these guys are
               seeing something up there.

                              ECKHARDT
               No comment. Print what you like.

                              KNOX
               Come on. One question. Is there a
               six-foot bat in Gotham City?

     KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts 
     in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:

                              KNOX (cont.)
               If so, is he on the police payroll?
               If so, what's he pulling down after
               taxes?

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. 
     He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling 
     across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the 
     dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.

     ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. 
     He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the 
     block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered 
     up alongside him.

     ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it 
     quickly in his coat.

                              JACK
               You didn't show up.

                              ECKHARDT
               We had another bat sighting.

                              JACK
               I'm sure that was vitally important.
               Listen: things are heating up.
               Someone is leaking information to
               Harvey Dent.

     ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
               problem --

                              JACK
               Eckhardt... our problems are your
               problems.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'll work on it.

     JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his 
     topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the 
     material between his fingers.

                              JACK
               Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
               ostentatious on a cop's salary,
               don't you think?

                              ECKHARDT
                     (knocking his hands away)
               I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
               you.

                              JACK
               You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
               should be thinking about the future.

     ECKHARDT laughs in his face.

                              ECKHARDT
               Ambition.
                     (nodding his head)
               Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
               that organization.

                              JACK
               And why's that?

                              ECKHARDT
               You're a psycho, friend. You're an
               A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
               it.

     JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The 
     fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.

     JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back 
     full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an 
     all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

     By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. 
     ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.

                              JACK
               Here. Use mine.

     JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in 
     ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT 
     to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the 
     stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.

     ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one 
     crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.

                              JACK (cont.)
               It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
               here is a good cop. A real good cop.
                     (pause; smiling)
               Inexpensive.

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and 
     fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. 
     ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his 
     hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.

                              KNOX
               What have you got for me, Jerry?

     JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, 
     fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption 
     at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in 
     approval.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
               on the fangs, huh?

     He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED 
     COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:

                              COLLEAGUE
               Hey Knox, you got a visitor.

                              KNOX
               I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
               dust him, okay?

                              COLLEAGUE
               This one you might want to dust
               yourself.

     Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops 
     in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. 
     The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a 
     WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, 
     her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.

                              KNOX
               ... Vicki Vale.

     The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock 
     of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls 
     KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.

                              VICKI
               How'd you know it was me?

                              KNOX
               Honey -- I would know any randomly
               selected square inch of Vicki
               Vale.
                     (grinning)
               If I had a good enough hint.

     He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears 
     the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Where the hell have you been?

                              VICKI
               A nice, restful vacation.

     She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of 
     glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn 
     corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.

                              KNOX
               God, a girl could get hurt doing
               this.

                              VICKI
               I do get hurt.

     She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long 
     fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then 
     points to the scar and adds, slyly:

                              KNOX
               Got any more of those?

                              VICKI
               Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
               here. What's new and hot in Gotham
               City?

                              KNOX
               It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
               foot bat that swoops out of the
               night and preys on evildoers.

                              VICKI
                     (laughing)
               Evildoers, huh? Big or small?

                              KNOX
               Small so far. I mean -- they don't
               allow bats in boardrooms, do they.

                              VICKI
               Speaking of which... I hear the
               notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
               big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
               law'n'order freak in the city's
               gonna be there.

     KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI 
     may have a purpose in all this.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --

     She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an 
     INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
                     (apprehensively)
               Got a date?

     She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. 
     KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, 
     nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
               loved you. Will you marry me?

                              VICKI
                     (straightening her clothes)
               No.

                              KNOX
               Well, I'm starving. Will you at
               least buy me a hamburger?

                              VICKI
               Yes, but please -- be gentle.

     Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

     A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. 
     This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power 
     perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City 
     rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.

     GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS 
     -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types 
     and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this 
     makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the 
     Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.

                              GRISSOM
               Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
               don't like the way this is shaping
               up.

     JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's 
     right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.

                              JACK
               We can always pop him. -- Or pop
               someone close to him.

                              LIEUTENANT
               Let's feed him to the bat.

     This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the 
     crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.

                              GRISSOM
               He's going after our front
               companies. Specifically Ace
               Chemical. Which would tie us
               in with Councilman Kane, Senator
               Miller... on up the line.
                     (pause)
               We have to clean out our files
               before the subpoena comes down.

                              LIEUTENANT
               How do we go? The usual fire?

                              GRISSOM
               I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
               office, remove the relevant
               documents... 

                              JACK
               "Industrial espionage."

                              GRISSOM
               That's right. And Jack --
                     (pause)
               I'd like you to handle this
               operation personally.

     JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the 
     deck. His hand freezes in midair.

                              JACK
               ... Me?

     At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA 
     HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. 
     She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.

                              GRISSOM
               Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
               mind waiting in the other room.

     ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side 
     door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.

                              JACK
               Why do you need me to handle a
               simple break-in?

                              GRISSOM
                     (emphatically)
               Because I want someone I can
               trust.

     JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the 
     fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.

     It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre 
     HOLE through its face.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               We'll work out the details later.
               But it's got to be soon. -- All
               right, that's all for now.

     GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers 
     behind a moment.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
               important job. I can't trust it to
               somebody who'll screw up.

                              JACK
               I understand.

                              GRISSOM
                     (smiling)
               Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.

     JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the 
     big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               My friend, your luck is just about
               to change.

     He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway 
     nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles 
     coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
     hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a 
     team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind, 
     not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor; 
     the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, 
     blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's 
     power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money 
     into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.

     DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies, 
     telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another 
     group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots 
     and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a 
     corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands 
     ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.

     A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of 
     champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.

                              KNOX
               How high up would you say that is?

                              ALFRED
               I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

                              KNOX
               You know, if you cut your bathroom
               in half, you'd have my apartment.

                              ALFRED
               Which bathroom is that, air?

                              KNOX
               The small one.

     KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later, 
     VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers 
     and hooks up with KNOX.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
               actually know all these people?

                              VICKI
               Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
                     (pause)
               I'm quoting.

     KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.

                              KNOX
               Yeah, I guess we move in different
               circles. -- Though I did meet a
               one-eyed pimp last week.

     ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

     Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent 
     in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into 
     his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.

     Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and 
     VICKI wander up alongside him.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner Gordon! What do you
               hear from our pointy-eared friend?

     KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his 
     fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.

                              GORDON
               Knox, for the ninth time, and you
               can quote me -- there is no bat.

                              KNOX
               Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
               one honest cop in Gotham city.

     HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a 
     friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.

                              DENT
               How's your luck, Jim?

                              KNOX
               Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
               winged vigilantes?

     DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.

                              DENT
               Mr. Knox, I think we have enough
               real problems in this city without
               worrying about ghosts and goblins
               and Halloween characters.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."  
     From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping 
     TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously 
     applying BLACK CAMOUFLAGE PAINT to his face. He could be 
     getting ready for a date.

     The van is parked outside a chain-link fence which 
     surrounds the Ace Chemical complex.

     JACK'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

     The SECURITY GUARD in a glass booth at the entrance to the 
     parking lot. ONE OF JACK'S BOYS creeps up behind the booth 
     and takes the GUARD out.

     INT. VAN - ON JACK

     He turns the key in the ignition, shifts into first.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     KNOX and VICKI are taking an unauthorized tour of BRUCE's 
     house, wandering through rooms decorated in wildly 
     divergent motifs, eyeing an astounding collection of 
     artworks and antiques from every corner of the world.

                              KNOX
               My question is, where does one man
               get all this junk.

                              VICKI
               All over the world. They say he
               spends most of the year overseas --
               until recently, anyway.

                              KNOX
               Holy shit... 

     KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... We found the arsenal.

     One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound 
     volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds. 
     Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords... 
     every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever 
     devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               This guy has just gotten
               interesting. What else do you know?

                              VICKI
               Just what I've heard. Rich.
               Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.

                              KNOX
               Likes to kill?

                              VICKI
                     (smiling)
               Women find him magnetic.

                              KNOX
               I bet they like him for his big
               charity balls.

                              VICKI
               That, and the sweet smell of two
               hundred million bucks.

                              KNOX
               Well, you know me. The more they've
               got, the less they're worth.
                     (scanning the room)
               This guy must be the most worthless
               man in America.

     Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.

                              BRUCE WAYNE
               You disappoint me. Why not the
               world?

     KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face 
     of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... 
     and intensely handsome.

                              KNOX
               I assume in my usual charming manner
               I've just insulted the host.
                     (extending a hand)
               Alexander Knox.

                              BRUCE
               Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
               I quite like it.

                              KNOX
               Great. Give me a grant.

                              BRUCE
               I might consider it if you introduce
               me to Miss Vale.

     KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she 
     is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:

                              KNOX
               "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
               redundant.

                              BRUCE
                     (to VICKI)
               You're just back from Corto Maltese.
               I saw your combat photos. Quite a
               departure for you.

                              VICKI
               That's intriguing. They haven't been
               published yet.

     BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.

                              BRUCE
               ... You have an extraordinary eye.

     He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial 
     instincts aroused, pipes up:

                              KNOX
               Some people think she has two.

     VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:

                              VICKI
               Don't mind my friend. He's a little
               nervous tonight.

     KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his 
     competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's 
     something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
     could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's 
     almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation 
     of charm.

     This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
     like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm 
     turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:

                              VICKI (cont.)
               This is an amazing house. I'd love
               to shoot it sometime.

                              BRUCE
               I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
               you be staying in Gotham for a
               while?

                              VICKI
               As far as I know.

                              BRUCE
               Good. Then with any luck we'll run
               into each other.

     Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind 
     them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.

                              ALFRED
               Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
               was compelled to leave -- very
               unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
               his regrets.

                              BRUCE
               Thank you, Alfred.
                     (to VICKI)
               I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
               great pleasure meeting you.
                     (to KNOX)
               And you.

     Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and 
     strides hurriedly out of the room.

                              KNOX
               I know the rich are different, but
               that guy is real different.

     VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Hello? Vicki?

                              VICKI
               Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.

                              KNOX
               What were you thinking?

                              VICKI
               Yum, yum.

                              KNOX
               Well, he must like the way he
               looks. He's got a mirror in every
               room.

     And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous 
     WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to 
     ceiling.

                              VICKI
               I get it. Bruce Vain.

     She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we

                                                 CUT TO:

     REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR

     looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- 
     as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording 
     everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, 
     state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

     showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
     reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a 
     whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control 
     center, we can see everything that's happening in the 
     house.

     Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward, 
     with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.

     At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
               Chemical Company.

                              GORDON
                     (obviously agitated)
               Good Lord, it we could put our hands
               on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
               about this? Who's in charge of
               the --

                              PATROLMAN
               Lt. Eckhardt, sir.

                              GORDON
               Eckhardt. Oh my God... 

     And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat. 
     The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights 
     off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing 
     out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.

     The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.

                              ECKHARDT
               Shoot to kill.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a 
     blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are 
     at work on the filing cabinets.

     The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal 
     door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:

                              SAFECRACKER
               ... Empty.

                              HOOD I
               Just like the file cabinets.

                              HOOD II
               I don't get it. If this place is
               cleaned out already, what do we need
               five men?

     JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny. 
     By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.

     Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares 
     outside.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT

     ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE 
     BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED 
     COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM. 
     ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.

                              ECKHARDT
               What are you trying to do, blow the
               collar?

                              GORDON
                     (to SWAT TEAM)
               You men are dismissed. We'll take
               over from here.
                     (to UNIFORMED COPS)
               Any man who opens fire on Jack
               Napier... will answer to me.

     ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               You. Stick around.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

     JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two 
     stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network 
     of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.

     Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.

                              COP
               Freeze!

     One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his 
     colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear 
     exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.

     ANGLE ON GORDON

     standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building 
     and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING 
     OUT as the HOODS scatter.

                              ECKHARDT
                     (snidely)
               Nice work, Commissioner.

                              GORDON
               I'm in charge here. Not Carl
               Grissom.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when 
     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant 
     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its 
     massive chest. BATMAN.

     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in 
     the opposite direction.

     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across 
     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a 
     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL 
     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, 
     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts 
     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS 
     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES 
     -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he 
     throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES 
     SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of 
     plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place 
     over giant basins.

     JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine 
     to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.

     ANGLE ON CATWALKS

     BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated 
     walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them 
     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.

     BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED 
     HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS 
     HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.

     HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his 
     ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. 
     A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.

     HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a 
     miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... 
     planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.

     ANGLE ON COPS

     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.

                              COP
               LOOK!

                              GORDON
               My God... it's him.

     ANGLE ON CATWALK

     HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. 
     BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III 
     with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.

     He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once 
     through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.

     Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the 
     HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB 
     UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE 
     STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK 
     to the factory floor forty feet below!

     INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

     JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; 
     STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking 
     lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting 
     for JACK to make his move.

     No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team 
     -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind 
     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.

     INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

     JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the 
     metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out 
     onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... 
     begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.

     COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last 
     pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.

     AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.

     INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

     COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses 
     out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN 
     FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.

     JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The 
     cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, 
     hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE 
     begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate 
     opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!

     Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If 
     JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting 
     shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to 
     his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.

     JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he 
     does --

     BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! 
     His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in 
     diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The 
     plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.

     An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm 
     around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED 
     STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... 

                              VOICE
               HOLD IT!

     In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind 
     the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

                              HOOD V
               Let him go or I'll do it.

     BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to 
     himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he 
     strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the 
     back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.

     All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. 
     HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he 
     waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.

     ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his 
     side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the 
     Commissioner plugged.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. 
     He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a 
     supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling 
     black currents of the East River... and freedom.

     He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 
     AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor 
     of the catwalk mere yards away.

     ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

     The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the 
     Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.

                              HOOD V
               Nobody makes a move. We go out
               clean.

                              JACK'S VOICE
               ECKHARDT!!

     ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands 
     poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops 
     ECKHARDT cleanly.

     The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a 
     NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at 
     the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- 
     a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.

     The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, 
     DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.

     AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. 
     JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. 
     BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

     JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

     A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized 
     pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.

                              GORDON
               NO!!

     But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, 
     totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The 
     COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN 
     into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING 
     ALL THE WAY.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Goddammit, we had him. We --

     And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention 
     focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle 
     warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS 
     ON HIS BELT.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Hold it right there, Mister.

     THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then 
     -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto 
     the factory floor.

     A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild 
     pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily 
     dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN 
     from view.

     A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling 
     cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.

                              COP
               LOOK!

     The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too 
     late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF 
     THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an 
     avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy 
     heights, safely out of range.

                              GORDON
               HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                              COP
               ... Who is this guy?

                              GORDON
               I don't know, but he's one hell of a
               showman.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the 
     illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the 
     chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky 
     deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the 
     oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

     As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck 
     swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER 
     -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

     A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we

                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe: "BAT 
     MAN FOILS ROBBERY. WHO IS MASKED VIGILANTE?"

     Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a 
     jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
               Don't tell me some lie you'll have
               to retract later.

     CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking 
     up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
               is getting ambitious. -- Why the
               dopey grin?

                              VICKI
               Guess who's got a date with Bruce
               Wayne.

                              KNOX
               Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
               and asked you for a date?... Shit.
                     (shouting)
               HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
                     (to VICKI)
               I want you to pay close attention to
               this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
               what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

     A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ, 
     60, is the society editor of the Globe.

                              MIRANDA
               You mean Mister One-Nighter?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
                     (to VICKI)
               Because that's the average length of
               his relationships with women.

                              MIRANDA
               The current record is almost two
               weeks. That cover girl -- what's her
               name? You must've shot her, Vicki --

                              KNOX
               Tell her about the peanuts.

                              VICKI
               Peanuts?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes
               through women.

                              MIRANDA
               Like Planter's Peanuts.

     VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.

                              VICKI
               Plain or roasted?
                     (standing up)
               Alex, I'm very flattered that you've
               gone out and done all this research.

                              KNOX
               Why?
                     (blushing suddenly)
               Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter.
               I'm curious. I do this for a living.
               -- What'd you tell him?

                              VICKI
               I told him yes.

     KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes 
     KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               You're awfully sweet to be
               concerned, but it's really not
               necessary. I'll call you, okay?

     She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.

                              KNOX
               ... What was that?

                              MIRANDA
               That was one of the most gracious
               fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure
               to watch. -- What a nice girl.

     KNOX, totally flustered, sighs and sinks into his chair.

                              KNOX
               Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. COASTLINE - DAY

     A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance, 
     closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.

     EXT. DECK - YACHT - DAY

     BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE 
     FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs, 
     soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.

                              VICKI
               Do you sail?

                              BRUCE
               Too much work. I'm not really the
               physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.

     ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of 
     drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches 
     for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin 
     over braided telephone cables.

                              VICKI
               You do a very convincing imitation.
                     (sipping her drink)
               Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?

     He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for 
     her to try a sip.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Ginger ale?

                              BRUCE
               Two drinks and I start swinging from
               the rooftops.
                     (beat)
               Tell me, Vicki. There's something
               I'm very curious about. What took
               you down to Corto Maltese?

                              VICKI
               ... I guess I needed a change.

                              BRUCE
               You were one of the most successful
               magazine photographers in the city.
               Everyone wanted you.

                              VICKI
               Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?

                              BRUCE
               Not since the shooting started.

                              VICKI
               We went there once when I was
               little. I played on the beach. And
               at nights -- they had a band -- I
               danced with my father on the hotel
               patio.
                     (shrugging)
               That was Corto Maltese. When the war
               broke out I had to go back. And I
               promised myself that this time... I
               wouldn't look away.

                              BRUCE
               What did you see?

                              VICKI
               ... Terror.

     The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. 
     VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.

                              BRUCE
               There's terror everywhere. Some
               types are just more -- familiar
               than others.

     For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his 
     familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
               know it all seems a million miles
               away, out here on the water, with
               all this --

                              BRUCE
               Insulation?

     VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she 
     can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.

                              VICKI
               Bruce, really, when I say these
               things I don't mean to criticize
               you.

                              BRUCE
               I think you see things very clearly.

                              VICKI
               I'm happy to talk about something
               else. I don't want to be depressing.

                              BRUCE
                     (smiling)
               Do you assume that if I know you
               better I won't like you as much?

     VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but 
     if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
               you like this with the other women
               you know? -- Because I just can't
               seem to get a handle on this
               conversation.

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
               ambiguous, I think you should put
               the most flattering possible
               interpretation on it. Because even
               if it doesn't sound that way... 
               that's how I'll mean it.

     Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's 
     also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before 
     she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

     Rigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big 
     crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile."

     WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in 
     the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although 
     most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA 
     #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above 
     the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.

     She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some 
     rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing 
     a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box.

     DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has 
     her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box.

     HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX

     BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and 
     whispers back.

     A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But 
     her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera 
     glasses SNAP SHUT.

     ANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3

     staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of 
     TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a 
     chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up.

                              VICKI
               -- but it's not fair. I'm half
               drunk and you're not even --

                              BRUCE
               Would you like me to take you home?

                              VICKI
               God. You would.
                     (sidling up to him)
               Come on, Bruce. I just want to get
               two drinks in you. As an
               experiment.

                              BRUCE
               Maybe we should just kiss.

                              VICKI
               ... We could try that.

     WIDER ANGLE

     BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry 
     hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite 
     walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to:

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole 
     near the Gotham docks.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect 
     in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of 
     an unlicensed gangland doctor.

     The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner 
     of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.

                              DOCTOR
               Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we
               did.

     He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:

     JACK NAPIER'S POV

     The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands 
     there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His 
     eyes bug out. He GAGS.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
     still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     ANGLE ON DOCTOR

     He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand 
     mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats. 
     Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to 
     the floor.

     JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.

                              DOCTOR
               You understand the facial muscles
               were completely severed --

     JACK keeps on laughing.

     The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at 
     his seedy equipment.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               -- you can see what I have to work
               with here --

     MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with 
     one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               I'm sure that with proper recon--
               recon-- reconstructive surgery --

     A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a 
     sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table.

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT

     From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the 
     alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head. 
     We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is 
     BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling.

     It's almost as though BRUCE is not used to sleeping at 
     night. He doesn't know what to do with himself.

     He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all 
     that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really 
     rather be somewhere else.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club 
     as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.

                              KID
                    Nice hair, dude!

     JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he 
     gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER -- 
     and strides deliberately across the street.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

     The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-
     glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the 
     private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in 
     the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.

                              GRISSOM (O.S.)
               That you, sugar bumps?

     GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. 
     He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his 
     impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his 
     hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up 
     figure at his desk.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Who the hell are you?

                              JACK
               It's me. "Sugar Bumps."

                              GRISSOM
                     (recognizing his voice)
               Jack?
                     (advancing cautiously)
               Thank God. I can't believe it's you.
               I heard you'd been --

                              JACK
                     (standing up)
               Is that what you "heard"?

     JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't 
     move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.

                              JACK (cont.)
               YOU SET ME UP!
                     (beat)
               Over a girl. You must be insane!

     GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

                              JACK (cont.)
               Keep your hands on the desk.

                              GRISSOM
               Sooner or later you would've tried
               to take me, Jack. You may get me
               now, but your life won't be worth a
               dime.

                              JACK
               I've died once already. It wasn't so
               bad. -- In fact I recommend it.

     GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK 
     is utterly, hopelessly deranged.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

                              JACK
               JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK??

     And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS 
     THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock 
     -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.

     His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous 
     seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from 
     the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, 
     PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

                              JACK (cont.)
               I'm not a Jack any more.
                     (pause; cackling)
               You made me a Joker!

     THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. 
     GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the 
     desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT
               LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

                              JACK
               HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

     And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires 
     again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.

     EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, 
     arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW 
     spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from 
     this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel 
     chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.

                              JOKER
               What a view. Our little city. It
               always brings a smile to my face.

     He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at 
     GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still 
     wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Guess it's my little city now.
               Wonder what it'll look like when I
               get done with it.
                     (pause)
               I bet it'll be something real fine.
               Real fine and pretty.

                                                 DISSOLVE T0:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A 
     SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent 
     bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."

     She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow 
     she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.

     INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING

     BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to 
     himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He 
     instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.

                              VICKI
               I didn't mean to scare you. I just
               had to come in here and see it that
               was really you singing.

     She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if 
     she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
                     (singing)
               "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to
               touch my cup." Come on. "You're my
               sugar --"
                     (no response from BRUCE)
               Bruce, you are such a case.

     BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly 
     recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost 
     childish smile.

                              BRUCE
               I don't sing very well.

                              VICKI
               Then there's one thing in the world
               you don't do very well. And I know
               what it is. -- Now you'll have to
               kill me.

     He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a 
     towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               Poor thing. You should stay off that
               horse.

     INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the 
     Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and 
     there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. 
     It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.

                              KNOX
                     (disgusted)
               ...Peanut.

     A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:

                              COPY BOY
               Here's that morgue file you wanted.

     KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE 
     WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf 
     through old clippings from back issues of the Globe.

     WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE 
     HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE 
     VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in 
     dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell 
     a rich philanthropist can be.

                              KNOX
               Come on. Gimme some dirt!

     Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of 
     clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two 
     partial exceptions.

     One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the 
     camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an 
     ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair 
     down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN 
     1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... Why don't you like your picture
               taken?

                                                   CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT

     A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's 
     apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the 
     glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, 
     peering inside, hesitant to enter.

     As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, 
     tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's 
     almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her.

                              DOORMAN
               Miss Hunt!
                     (smiling)
               No need to sneak in. The rent's been
               taken care of.

                              ALICIA
               ... The rent? Paid?

     INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ALICIA, mystified, lets herself in and turns to lock the 
     door. She's startled once more by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

                              VOICE
               Honey -- I'm home!

     She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

     Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on 
     his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket 
     and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.

     This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a 
     dead faint.

     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY

     It looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. At a 
     long table sit Gotham's most distinguished criminals: 
     GANGLORDS and RACKETS BOSSES from every corner of the city. 
     They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.

                              JOKER (O.S.)
               So that's how it is, gents. Until
               Grissom decides it's safe to come up
               for air... I'm running the show.

     Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather 
     flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with 
     flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.

     Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.

                              GANG BOSS
               So why don't we hear this from
               Grissom?

                              RACKETEER
               I got something I'd like to know.
               How come you're wearing that stupid
               smirk?

                              JOKER
               'Cause I got an army, chum. And I
               got Grissom's army. And this city
               is mine.

     CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:

                              ROTELLI
               I don't like taking orders, from
               Grissom. And I especially don't like
               taking orders from Grissom's goon.

                              JOKER
               I've considered that possibility.

                              ROTELLI
               And what happens if we say no?

                              JOKER
                     (chuckling)
               Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we
               can't do business, we shake hands
               and part friends.

                              ROTELLI
               That's it?

                              JOKER
               That's it.

     THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it. 
     He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's 
     palm.

     40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back 
     into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his 
     sleeves and shirt collar.

     The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a 
     move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Looks like Carmine got a little hot
               under the collar.

                              CRIMELORD
               ... You're insane!

     The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and 
     mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE 
     FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

                              JOKER
               That's what they said about Lee
               Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
               THINK IT OVER!

     The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE 
     JOKER alone in the room with the charred corpse of ROTELLI. 
     THE JOKER sinks into a chair and -- as is his wont -- 
     ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Heck, they're not such bad guys. I
               say we give 'em a couple of days to
               come around.
                     (thoughtful pause)
               We-e-ll... maybe one day.
                     (then, casually)
               Aaah, screw it. Let's grease 'em.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. SMALL BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A poker game. A CRIMELORD from the JOKER's board meeting 
     picks up his hand and fans out the cards. FIVE JOKERS.

     He looks up, puzzled. The last thing he sees is a HIRED 
     KILLER bursting in through the door, GUN IN HAND.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - DAY

     A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from 
     a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2 
     strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be 
     politely refuses.

     THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But, 
     as we quickly find out, it's not a helium tank -- it's a 
     FLAMETHROWER.

     EXT. HALLIDAY PLAZA - DAY

     A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate 
     skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many 
     nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all 
     smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.

                              VICKI
               ... To tell you the truth, I'd just
               about given up waiting.

                              BRUCE
               I said I'd call you the minute I got
               free. And I did. -- And here we are.

                              VICKI
                     (teasing him)
               Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.

     He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki. Do you want the whole truth?
               All coyness aside?
                     (long pause)
               I wish I had more time to give you.
               Every day I don't see you, I miss
               you.
                     (beat)
               Now. Are you going to waste this
               lovely afternoon being all mad at
               me?

     All this, of course, is delivered with devastating 
     sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.

                              VICKI
               Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so
               much like someone I used to... 
                     (stopping suddenly)
               Bruce? I know this is silly, but --
               you're not married, are you?

     He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT

     PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- 
     enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way 
     along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.

                              VICKI
               All street mimes should be executed.

                              BRUCE
               ... Looks like a convention.

     And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging 
     on the center of the plaza.

     RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a 
     skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the 
     passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.

     A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME 
     reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.

     SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.

     VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's 
     HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT 
     with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:

     -    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY 
          and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding 
          the CROWD at bay;

     -    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully 
          imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;

     -    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as 
          OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... 

     ... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for 
     a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in 
     the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's 
     just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.

     He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, 
     CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's 
     practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible 
     anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

     A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.

     ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS

     BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.

     ANGLE ON BRUCE

     his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood 
     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's 
     almost as if the bullets are striking him.

     A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI 
     emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the 
     wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.

     As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- 
     with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks 
     up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so 
     desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!!

     He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's 
     eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.

                              BRUCE
               Oh my God... are you all right?

     He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.

     He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, 
     pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her 
     face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

               Ricorso's death is the third in a
               rash of underworld killings... 

     CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
               Commissioner, you've heard the
               rumors. Are these murders the work
               of the mysterious 'Batman'?

     A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the 
     TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big 
     desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.

                              JOKER
               All reet! I think it's about time
               we called another meeting, huh?

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand.

                              ALFRED
               I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him
               your messages. That's all I can do.

     ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously 
     distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY

                              VICKI
               Please tell him... I'm not trying to
               make his life difficult. I'd just --
               I'd just like to know what's going
               on.

     A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, 
     finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd
               like you to see.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- 
     all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins 
     cranking through back-issue newspapers.

                              KNOX
               Okay, here we go. Check it out.

     He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A 
     FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:

                      THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
            Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
            Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

     Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics 
     with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE 
     WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.

     The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask 
     of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.

                              VICKI
               Oh my God... I've seen this picture.

                              KNOX
               I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.

                              VICKI
               His face. Allie, look at his face.

     TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and 
     disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years 
     -- permanently, indelibly traumatized. The same face VICKI
     saw in Halliday Plaza.

                              KNOX
               Yep. He watched the whole thing
               happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
               Jim Gordon.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce... 

                              KNOX
               Something like this -- what do you
               suppose this could drive a guy to?

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     A greasy spoon off the lobby of the Globe building. KNOX
     and VICKI in a booth.

                              VICKI
               Alexander, you are on drugs.

                              KNOX
               He walks out on his own party. Half
               an hour later, the Caped Crusader
               turns up in full bat-drag.
                     (beat)
               Sees an execution, freaks out in an
               alleyway. No place to change.
                     (smiling)
               Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all
               right.

                              VICKI
               You're pissing me off, Allie. I know
               exactly why you're doing this.

                              KNOX
                     (leaning forward)
               Oh? Why is that, Vicki?

     VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for 
     a second, then changes the subject.

                              VICKI
               He's best friends with Jim Gordon
               and Harvey Dent. They would know.

                              KNOX
               ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession
               to make. I'm the Batman.

     VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Don't believe me? Why not?

                              VICKI
               Alexander... I know you.

                              KNOX
               Right. And they know him. And
               that's why it would never occur to
               them for a minute that their old
               buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night
               and goes out looking for --

                              VICKI
               This is pointless. I'm leaving.

                              KNOX
                     (grabbing her arm)
               Your little chum is out of his mind.
                     (relaxing his grip)
               Next time you call him up and he
               can't go out Friday night -- think
               it over.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - DAY

     LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above 
     the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing 
     production like a demented middle manager.

     INT. STOREROOM - DAY

     A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical, 
     which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-
     LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.

     CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping 
     manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.

     More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-
     seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the 
     initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.

     Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS: 
     RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title 
     page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'

     And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and
     orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing 
     HIDEOUS, CHEMICAL-INDUCED GRIMACES.

     ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.

     ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic 
     reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half 
     HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.

     The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the 
     floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.

                              JOKER
               How's that first shipment coming?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Right on schedule. Oh, we got that
               address for you -- 79 East End,
               #12-C.

                              JOKER
               Mmm. How'd you find it?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Called her agent.

     The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the 
     floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and 
     scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible 
     scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.

     One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of 
     Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a 
     massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.

     We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in 
     Corto Maltese.

     INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

     In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion: 
     mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN 
     BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.

     In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend, 
     CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.

                              CLAIRE
               ... of course, after Corto Maltese,
               this must all seem pretty tame.

                              VICKI
               Not to me. I need a job.

                              CLAIRE
               Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've
               got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.

                              VICKI
               Then "everyone" must know something
               I don't.

                              CLAIRE
                     (cattily)
               Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on,
               dear, Tony's dying to see you.

     In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, 
     is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They 
     all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around 
     hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.

                              TONY
               Yes, ladies, smiles, show me
               those smiles, fabulous, tropical
               smiles, think Tahiti, I want to
               see teeth, yes, those glorious
               teeth --

     As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place 
     simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

                              TONY (cont.)
               My God no, don't stop now, those
               smiles, I need those smiles --

     Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is 
     unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is 
     terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.

     The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH 
     SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.

                              TONY (cont.)
               Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
                     (beat)
               No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
               pull back!
                     (dropping the camera)
               OH MY GOD!

     The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering 
     convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN, 
     LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

     The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and
     DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead 
     SUPERMODELS.

                              PATSY
               The fashion world was stunned today
               by the sudden deaths of top models
               Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg.
               Cause of death has been attributed
               to a violent allergic reaction,
               although authorities have not yet
               ruled out the possibility of drug
               use. Dave?

     Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in 
     canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.

                              DAVE
               In Gotham, plans continue for the
               city's 300th birthday celebration.
               The four-day event will conclude
               with the unveiling, in Gotham
               Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady
               Gotham'... 

     A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               This bulletin just in. Nine more
               mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor
               in --

     Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               Patsy! This is hardly the --
                     (his eyes widen)
               PATSY!!

     An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat, 
     mouth agape in horror.

     PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY 
     RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS 
     UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

     TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy. 
     PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the 
     newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
     grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

     DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:

                              DAVE (cont.)
               KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --

     Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A 
     moment later, we're looking at:

     SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

     Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as 
     a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up 
     underneath.

                              MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)
               ... Love that Joker!

     INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

     THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- 
     THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The 
     shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK 
     HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.

     INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

     PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has 
     been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.

                              DIRECTOR
               WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

                              TECHNICIAN
               I DON'T KNOW!

     CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

                              JOKER
               ... new improved Joker brand. With
               the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL!
                     (a sweep of the hand)
               Let's go to our blind taste test.

     TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied 
     to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before 
     him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE 
     reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of
               sorts.
                     (wagging a finger)
               He's been using Brand X! But with
               new improved Joker brand... 

     ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his 
     chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!

     EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY

     THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before 
     him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH 
     DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               -- and the world smiles with you!
               Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --

     He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as 
     he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react 
     to the JOKER's maniacal promo.

                              JOKER
               I know what you're saying. Where can
               I buy these fine, fine products?
               Well, that's the gag, folks, you
               never know. Chances are... you've
               bought 'em already!!!

     As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:

     -    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for 
          a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under 
          one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can, 
          suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?

     -    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable 
          as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then 
          FREEZE with their forks in midair.

     -    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, 
          she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We 
          FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.

          On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE. 
          Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal 
          GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

     ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.

                              ALFRED
               ... Sir!

     HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT 
     begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.

                              JOKER
               Baby's got a tummyache? Here's
               something that'll fix him quick!

     He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering -- 
     he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Now on your grocer's shelf. So
               remember -- use Joker brand -- and
               put on a happy face!!

     MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed 
     transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.

                Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives
                WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?

     -    An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is 
          curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  ... sixteen new deaths, with no clues
                  as to the Joker's identity or
                  demands. The list at potentially
                  lethal products now includes:
                  perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --

     -    The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY 
          GUARDS rush to the scene as THREE MATRONLY CUSTOMERS
          go into simultaneous smiling fits.

     -    An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

                              ANCHORMAN
                  Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
                  -- underarm deodorant --

     -    A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF 
          SWEAT under every arm. The doors slide open; ONCOMING 
          PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.

     -    The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100% 
          natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing 
          altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly 
          visible.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --
                  moisturizing cream --

     -    A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers. 
          The store is utterly devoid of customers.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     From across the street we see VICKI headed down the 
     sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay 
     phone.

                              VOICE
               She's outside the Fluegelheim.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

     A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is 
     at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying 
     pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered 
     cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.

     In all the city, he's the only person still using 
     cosmetics.

     A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:

                              ALICIA
               Jack? Who was that?

     As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of 
     ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are 
     unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is 
     COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.

                              JOKER
               Get dressed. We're going out.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING

     A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something 
     Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open 
     atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along 
     the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You 
     walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING

     The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
     filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly 
     matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI 
     enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in 
     hand.

                              VICKI
               I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?

                              MAITRE D'
               No, but your table is ready.

     INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING

     VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A 
     WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, 
     bearing a single word: URGENT.

                              WAITER
               Miss Vale, this just arrived for
               you.

     As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is 
     a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

               DEAR V. VALE,
                    PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

     Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find 
     a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

     She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN 
     SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.

     TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART 
     LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

     VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. 
     Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

     INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT

     GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN 
     toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS 
     lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.

     The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open 
     and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
     street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.

     A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are 
     carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a 
     "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE 
     CANS OF BLACK PAINT.

     The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with 
     an appreciative eye.

                              JOKER
               Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.

     He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a 
     pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT 
     RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.

     He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, 
     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water 
     lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. 
     Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING 
     BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.

     He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I kinda like this one. Leave it.

     INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as 
     hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. 
     The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.

                              JOKER
               I think it's safe to take that off.

     VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes 
     the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're quite beautiful.

                              VICKI
               ... Thank you.

                              JOKER
               Unfortunate, but I think we can work
               around it.

     He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches 
     for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry 
     Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
               who I am. -- Is this your
               portfolio?

     She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of 
     VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
     Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. 
     Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... 
               Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.

     He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               The panic. The bloody skulls. The
               armless screaming fellows... you
               know, the atrocities.
                     (smirking)
               Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
               comes out so clean, so lovely.

     VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate 
     the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I guess I'm just an old cornball,
               but... I live for beauty. I look
               around at my little city, it gets me
               down.
                     (indicating the photos)
               We don't have anything like this.
               Well, it came to me that what this
               city needs... is beautification. Kind
               of a big makeover.
                     (enraptured)
               Miss Vale, I finally realized that
               one man can make a difference. You
               know the saying. "In his image... 
               created he them"?

     VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, 
     getting more frightened by the minute.

                              VICKI
               And you want a --

                              JOKER
               A visual record, yes. A before-and-
               after kind of thing.
                     (leaning closer)
               This could make your reputation.

     Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the 
     impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
     on film. She reaches for her camera bag.

                              VICKI
               Maybe we should start with a
               portrait of the artist. People might
               like to see the face behind the
               makeup.

                              JOKER
                     (momentarily puzzled)
               ... Behind the makeup?

     Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened 
     restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse 
     job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
     looking at his real face!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.

     He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very 
     carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- 
     suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
               you ANYWHERE!

     He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly 
     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.

     He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
     got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he 
     POINTS at the WATER GLASS:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Well? What are you waiting for??

     Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS 
     ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.

     His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked 
     Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to 
     wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.

     His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the 
     running makeup, he LEERS at her.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
               makeup.
                     (leaning forward)
               What do you think?

     VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.

                              VICKI
               I've seen worse. Much worse.

                              JOKER
               Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
               a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
               after all.

     He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's 
     coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind 
     them... and a VOICE intrudes:

                              VOICE
               Jack?

     The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and 
     moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing 
     the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

                              JOKER
                     (to VICKI)
               Christ, it's my girlfriend.
                     (to ALICIA)
               WHAT?

                              ALICIA
               You said I could look at the
               pictures before you -- before you --

                              JOKER
               Shucks, honey, I forgot.
                     (rolling his eyes at
                      VICKI)
               I'm in trouble now.
                     (to ALICIA)
               This is business, sweetie. Why don't
               you go outside and see how the boys
               are coming?

     VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting 
     eerily through the abandoned tea room.

                              VICKI
                     (hesitantly)
               ... Why the mask?

                              JOKER
               Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
               Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

     ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
               One in a million. A work of art. In 
               fact... 

     We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off. 
     The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the 
     side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               She makes you look sick.

     VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE 
     FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a 
     weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.

                              VICKI
               You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
               THAT to her!

                              JOKER
               What? I improved her a little... 

     VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE 
     BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.

                              VICKI
               I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
               -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!

                              JOKER
               Miss Vale, was it something I said?
                     (brightly)
               Do you want to sniff my flower?

     There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds 
     it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.

                              VICKI
               NO!

     The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID 
     spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

     She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from 
     the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.

                              JOKER
               Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
               THE ROSES!!

     He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --

     A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW 
     DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face 
     to face with... 

     THE BATMAN!

     On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER 
     like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM 
     THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --

     -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP 
     OUTSIDE!!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... YOU!!

     On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt. 
     In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT 
     OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR 
     STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!

     The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!

     His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp, 
     still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN 
     FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL

     He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it. 
     As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a 
     BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!

     TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up 
     short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI 
     drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.

     The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign 
     on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.

     VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.

     EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK

     VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET 
     into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

                              BATMAN
               GET IN THE CAR!

                              VICKI
               WHICH CAR?

     VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there 
     are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only 
     one BATMOBILE.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Oh.

     The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, 
     indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the 
     passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning 
     array of electronic gadgetry.

                              BATMAN
               Ignition!

     As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the 
     dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, 
     synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the 
     cockpit alongside VICKI.

     Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the 
     Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE 
     FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of 
     the alley at ninety miles an hour.

     THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.

                              JOKER
               I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!

     The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH 
     PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind 
     him, the other half into a second car nearby.

     EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

     SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.

                              VICKI
               Look! Police!

                              BATMAN
               I called them.

                              VICKI
               Shouldn't we --

     A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The 
     COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the 
     BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out 
     from the front of the van.

                              GOON
               There they are! Dead ahead!

     THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.

                              JOKER
               ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian 
     restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, 
     BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the 
     streets, eager to join the chase.

     SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS

     COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an 
     intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN 
     makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE 
     PAVEMENT.

                              VICKI
               What about her? What about the girl?

                              BATMAN
               He won't kill her.
                     (gritting his teeth)
               GODDAMMIT!

     They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION 
     TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and 
     inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.

     BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. 
     And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on 
     collision with a lamppost.

     He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE 
     JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

     ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a 
     crowd around them.

                              VICKI
               Can't we --

                              BATMAN
               Too many people. Come on!
                     (as she scrambles out)
               SHIELDS!!

     The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields.

     With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into 
     place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the 
     BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.

     BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, 
     vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.

     INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S 
     VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.

                              GOON AT WHEEL
               Are they ours?

                              JOKER
               ... I don't know. We'd better get out
               of here.
                     (into RADIO MIKE)
               Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??

     The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately 
     down the street.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, 
     dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.

     INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off 
     the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:

                              GOON I
               We got 'em!

                              JOKER (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Take 'em! I want his head!

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining 
     on them; and then, from behind --

     BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They 
     dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.

     They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.

     INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the 
     mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still 
     alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her 
     arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width 
     of the alleyway five stories up.

                              BATMAN
               How much do you weigh?

                              VICKI
               ... A hundred and eight?

     He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the 
     CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue 
     of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, 
     and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.

                              BATMAN
               HANG ON!

     The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches 
     on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL 
     on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.

     BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. 
     One story; two stories; and then... 

     They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's 
     goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward 
     another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.

     Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
     stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

     In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own 
     waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a 
     chance to protest, he LETS GO.

     VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the 
     way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

     VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the 
     line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row 
     of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per 
     limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam 
     two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --

     -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.

     BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off 
     and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.

     The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and 
     fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black 
     INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.

     They move closer. And stop.

                              GOON I
               ... No blood.

                              GOON II
               Jesus.

                              GOON III
               Wait a minute.

     GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the 
     body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.

                              GOON IV
               ... What is that?

                              GOON III
               Some kind of body armor.

                              GOON I
               He's human after all. -- Take that
               mask off.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

     Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the 
     roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as 
     the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this 
     height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a 
     sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.

     ANGLE ON GOONS

     peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE 
     WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.

                              GOON I
               Well?... Who is this guy?

                              GOON II
               I dunno. You seen him before?

                              GOON III
               Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.

                              GOON IV
               Good idea. Let's check his wallet.

                              GOON I
               We'll worry about it later. Plug
               him.
                        (beat)
               In the head.

     GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A 
     FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

     Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.

                              GOON III
               Goddam, it's the redhead!

     ON VICKI

     A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the 
     GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds 
     the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.

     ON BRUCE

     HIS EYES WINK OPEN.

     ON VICKI

     momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP 
     SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds 
     it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and 
     then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a 
     TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... 

     ON THE THUGS

     No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.

                              GOON II
               Did you hit her?

                              GOON I
               Who cares? Wax that freak.

     They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes 
     out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL 
     and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas 
     pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.

     In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body 
     THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage 
     can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.

     GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the 
     way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

     Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the 
     alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at 
     BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.

     BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

     Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised 
     on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH 
     GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.

     ON VICKI

     She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons 
     everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, 
     grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet 
     her.

     VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S 
     FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the 
     roll, then drops it down her blouse.

     But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens 
     her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the 
     alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.

     It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI 
     clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous 
     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.

     Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out 
     how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.

                              BATMAN
               ... Not even a 'thank you'?

                              VICKI
               Well -- I think you might consider
               thanking me. You were good as
               dead.

                              BATMAN
               That's because you lied about your
               weight.
                     (a long pause)
               Thank you.

     VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               I'll have to ask you for that film.

                              VICKI
               I just wanted to distract them. I
               wasn't trying to get a picture of
               you.

     BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The 
     telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.

                              BATMAN
               Please.

                              VICKI
               I won't let you have it.

     THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I know you can break my neck and
               take it. But the Joker's on that
               same roll. I --

                              BATMAN
               The Joker is a murderer. And you
               were as good as dead. So --

                              VICKI
               Look, I appreciate what you did for
               me. But this is my job. And I'm
               keeping those pictures.

                              BATMAN
               All right, here's a compromise. I'll
               develop the photos. You keep the
               Jokers and I'll keep the rest.

                              VICKI
               How do I know you won't keep them
               all?

                              BATMAN
               Because I'll take you with me.

     He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His 
     voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy 
     from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to 
     him.

     Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands 
     over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
     shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Thank you, Vicki.

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you going to take me?

     No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her 
     closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand 
     delicately along the line of her cheek... 

     ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS 
     into BATMAN's arms.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in 
     his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at 
     the BATMOBILE two blocks down.

     The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. 
     But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL 
     OVER the fearsome machine.

     BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON 
     CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the 
     Batmobile.

     He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
     from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.

                              BATMAN
               Shields open.

     EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

     TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From 
     within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields open.

     The steel plates begin to retract.

                              BATMAN (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Ignition.

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.

                              COP
               There's somebody in there!

     They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO 
     LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

     COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there 
     stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances 
     toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes 
     dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

     PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless 
     BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting, 
     dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of 
     COP CARS in hot pursuit.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and 
     approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms 
     and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING 
     HEADLIGHTS.

                              BATMAN
               STOP!

     BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN 
     and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.

     SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible 
     behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's 
     powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL 
     THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

     A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on 
     either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

     VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.

                              VICKI
               ... How long have I been out?

                              BATMAN
               Quite a while. I took the scenic
               route.

                              VICKI
                     (gazing around her)
               Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
               What's that?

     He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.

                              BATMAN
               Garage door.

     EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by 
     underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a 
     SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.

     Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds 
     later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.

     INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S 
     FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.

                              VICKI
               I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
               -- how did you know my name?

     BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I'm serious. How did you know?

     No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and 
     SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL 
     LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

     Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE 
     GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

     ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

     One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES 
     ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF 
     AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

     The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL 
     -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- 
     winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

     INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

     We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to 
     acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant 
     penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of 
     blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the 
     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.

     BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips 
     off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are 
     TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.

     VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and 
     picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to 
     examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.

                              VICKI
               What is this stuff? Kevlar?

                              BATMAN
               Better. It's not on the market yet.

                              VICKI
               It doesn't protect your head,
               though.

                              BATMAN
               That's why I wear a target on my
               chest.

     THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his 
     futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost 
     flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more 
     carefree, than some guys we could name... 

     ... like Bruce Wayne.

     VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping 
     at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.

                              VICKI
               How'd you find this place?

                              BATMAN
               Stumbled across it when I was a boy.

     VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses 
     overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               They don't come down here. They're
               afraid of the lights.

                              VICKI
               I don't like bats. Not that kind.

                              BATMAN
               They used to terrify me. But I
               forced myself to keep coming back,
               and --
                     (smiling)
               -- I guess I became the thing I
               feared the most. I'll do your photos
               now.

     He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the 
     kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the 
     roll.

     VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She 
     kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.

     She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair 
     of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.

                              VICKI
               Who pays for all this?

                              BATMAN
               I have sponsors.

                              VICKI
               The computers?

                              BATMAN
               I'm running a check on the tainted
               products. There is a pattern.
               Beauty products. Personal hygiene.

                              VICKI
               No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
               all be showing our true faces now.

     She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. 
     But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.

                              BATMAN
               I've tracked all the records. Every
               shipment, every warehouse, every
               loading dock. Nothing. No
               opportunities for tampering. Somehow
               the Joker is supplying tainted
               ingredients... at the source.

                              VICKI
               Wait. You can just tap into any
               corporate database you want?
               Anywhere?

                              BATMAN
               Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
               I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
               are ready.

     He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out 
     the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

                              VICKI
               You could've killed him, you know.
               You could have killed the Joker.

                              BATMAN
               I had to save you, Vicki.
                     (turning to face her)
               Here you go. I think I'll let you
               keep the whole set.

     She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four 
     shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but 
     there's no clean angle on his face.

     VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Care for an autograph?

     He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her 
     with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."

     Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is 
     trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto 
     roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind 
     him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.

                              VICKI
               ... Bruce?

     HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:

                              BATMAN
               Are you talking to me?

     He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a 
     SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw 
     on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Maybe we've had enough for one
               night. I'll take you home.

     Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the 
     BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his 
     utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Do you want to do it this time?

     VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as 
     he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Don't be afraid. I'm here.

     She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the 
     mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.

     FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
     burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW 
     fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

     The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: 
     liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless 
     cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays 
     underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters 
     emerge from the opening of a hit musical.

     In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, 
     his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son 
     BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, 
     head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.

     THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the 
     sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts 
     an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.

     IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES 
     are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and 
     MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle 
     BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF 
     JOY. And then, without warning --

     A HANDGUN enters frame.

     The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps 
     protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, 
     begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.

     MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at 
     her throat.

     The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But 
     MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.

     The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.

     The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The 
     pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward 
     the sidewalk.

     A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.

     THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek 
     we cannot hear --

     -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.

     BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a 
     handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's 
     purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the 
     boy.

     Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his 
     parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny 
     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around 
     them.

     He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the 
     GUNMAN turns and runs.

     AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
     winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics 
     with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped 
     tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.

     There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away 
     from us. We can't see his face.

     And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's 
     hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name, 
     LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in 
     GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.

     But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. 
     Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
     face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death... 
     and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
     violate this most private and terrible of moments.

     At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the 
     sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN 
     is smiling prettily at BRUCE.

     The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.

     A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding 
     white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING 
     SOUND cuts through the silence.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught. 
     The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her 
     hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.

     Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her 
     amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a 
     VOICE at the other end of the line.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki... ?

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT

     BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined 
     study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
                     (long pause)
               I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
               Are you there?

     INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI

                              VICKI
               Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

                              BRUCE
               I'm sorry about the way things went
               between us. I'd very much like to
               see you again.

                              VICKI
               Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
               would be possible.

                              BRUCE
               I wish you'd reconsider.
                     (groping)
               I didn't stand you up today. The
               museum was closed when I got there.

                              VICKI
               I, uh... 

     ON VICKI

     Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki? Vi --

     She returns the receiver to its cradle.

     ON BRUCE

     He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and 
     sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror. 
     She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

     Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into 
     the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe, 
     still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across 
     from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.

                              KNOX
               Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
               telling me -- the car, the equipment
               -- somebody's paying for it.

                              VICKI
               I just can't --

                              KNOX
               The FBI. You know who's got the FBI
               computer contract? Wayne
               Technologies.
                     (shaking his head)
               The guy's bats all right. He's bat
               shit crazy. This is gonna be the
               most incredible --

                              VICKI
               But he's not.

                              KNOX
               Not what?

                              VICKI
               He's not crazy.

     KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his 
     chair.

                              KNOX
               Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
               here... who dresses up like a bat. He
               goes out at night and swings around
               -- in his cape -- on a rope.
                     (throwing up his hands)
               Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.

                              VICKI
               Allie... he wants to tell me.
               That's why he took me there. Because
               he's trying to tell me.

                              KNOX
               Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
               he can talk to his car.

     The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in 
     utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her 
     loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               He has to tell someone. And I'm the
               one. He's trying to tell me.

     KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up 
     and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:

                              KNOX
               Well, when he does you know my
               number.

     EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the
     Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline:

                       WAR OF THE FREAKS
             Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout

     In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, 
     dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. 
     "WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-
     hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing 
     news:

     INT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY

     BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his 
     broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a 
     fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can 
     wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.

                              BRUCE
               Don't sell. It won't last. We'll
               ride it out.

     With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver 
     to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a 
     squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the 
     hook.

     INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is 
     shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. 
     The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.

                              WAILING COLLEAGUE
               ... a nine-million-dollar bath!

     BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the 
     door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank 
     of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to 
     make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a 
     number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:

                              BRUCE
                     (the familiar rasp)
               Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought

               going to talk to you unless we can
               discuss it.

               Hi, Bruce.

     BRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His 
     face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE 
     still squeaking on the other end of the line.

     grunt. SUDDEN HUBBUB from the ONLOOKERS as a wave of VIDEO 
     NOISE wipes half the screen away.

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     Split-screen. On one side is the MAYOR. On the other -- 
     sitting in a director's chair with a big yellow HAPPY-FACE 
     BACKDROP behind him -- is the JOKER, grinning fiendishly.

                              JOKER
               Joker here. Can we talk?

     The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.

                              MAYOR
               "While this administration remains
               vehemently opposed to terrorism in
               any form, we are prepared to
               negotiate any reasonable demands
               which will guarantee the safety of
               the populace."

                              JOKER
               Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is
               kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having
               such a swell time, I just haven't
               thought any up.

     He shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But I'm a reasonable fella. If you
               want to make me an offer... 

     Panicked, the MAYOR and co. go into a quick huddle.

                              MAYOR
               All right, all right. Here's the
               deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of
               ten million dollars, payable in --

                              JOKER
               Ten million dollars. Ten million
               dollars.
                     (flying off the handle)
               Ten mi-- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just
               wiped out the stock market. I've
               cost you billions!
                     (petulantly)
               I want ten million and one.

                              MAYOR
               No, wait, please! We'll talk. Just
               tell us what you expect.

                              JOKER
               Goddammit, I expect to be treated
               like an ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!

     MORE VIDEO STATIC sweeps across the screen, pushing the 
     MAYOR clean out of frame. The JOKER leers at the camera.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I might just think up some demands.
               And I'm gonna talk to all my
               friends, and see what they want,
               too. And then maybe we'll get
               together -- have a little party --
               exchange presents.
                     (waving goodbye)
               Happy Birthday, Gotham.

     "The Shadow of Your Smile" comes up UNDERNEATH as the 
     JOKER's transmission ends and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

     INT. GLOBE CITY ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     FRANTIC ACTIVITY as REPORTERS rush to their telephones and
     typewriters. KNOX strolls slowly back to his desk. He's 
     sitting on the biggest story of his career... and now, as 
     he realizes grimly, nobody knows or cares.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - DAY

     A tiny island in Gotham Harbor, homesite of LADY GOTHAM -- 
     the huge, newly restored stone statue that welcomes 
     incoming ships. Her upper half is draped in a huge TARP 
     prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this Sunday.

     At the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big 
     wooden platform, complete with microphones, amplifiers and 
     spotlights. They raise a gigantic BANNER which reads: 
     "GOTHAM CITY -- 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION."

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A TAXI pulls away from the wrought-iron gate at the 
     entrance to the estate. KNOX ambles up to a stone pillar, 
     glances up at a VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the gate, and 
     hits a BUZZER.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
                     (through loudspeaker)
               Yes?

                              KNOX
               Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               Mr. Wayne is out for the day.

                              KNOX
               Actually, I wanted to talk to
               Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne,
               would you?

     KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. 
     Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY

     KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big 
     leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him.

                              BRUCE
               I've been expecting to hear from
               you.

                              KNOX
               Well, that's how it is, chum. She
               tells me everything.

                              BRUCE
               What is it you want?

                              KNOX
               Simple. You know the score. One
               column -- and I can bring all this
               tumbling down. I can take you off
               the streets once and for all.
                        (a shaky pause)
               I want you to hang up the suit. And
               I want you to stay away from Vicki.

                              BRUCE
               I can't do that. Not while the
               Joker's still out there.

                              KNOX
               Then stay away from Vicki. That's
               all I want, man. I just want your
               word.

     BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his 
     jacket for a cigarette.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               See, I don't know how it happened --
               she's a smart girl and you are an
               extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but
               she's in love with you.

                              BRUCE
               There's something I don't
               understand. If you've got the story,
               why haven't you printed it?

                              KNOX
               Because I --
                     (beat)
               Because she'd never speak to me
               again.

     KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs 
     out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
               have you got to offer? You gonna
               marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
                     (laughing bitterly)
               Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be
               Best Rodent?

     BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even 
     put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking 
     at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.

                              BRUCE
               Do you want a drink?

                              KNOX
               Yeah, a drink. "Civilized."  Man-to-
               man, right?

                              BRUCE
               Alfred, bring something for Mr.
               Knox. -- I'll have one too.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

     The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and 
     Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE 
     CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in 
     everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, 
     representing the King in progressive stages of 
     deterioration.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK

     She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               ... So we just pretend none of this
               ever happened. We never met. We --
                     (frightened)
               You're going to get yourself killed,
               Bruce. You know that, don't you?

                              BRUCE
               It wouldn't matter much.

                              VICKI
               I don't understand it. You can do so
               much good for people. As Bruce
               Wayne.

     He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the 
     same argument with himself a thousand times.

                              BRUCE
               Money makes money, Vicki. The
               foundation runs itself. -- I'm
               extraneous to the process.

                              VICKI
               You're one man. You can't save
               everybody.

                              BRUCE
               What it I could save a handful?
               -- What if I could save one?

     VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands 
     up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:

                              VICKI
               Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
               can't even save yourself.

                              BRUCE
                     (staring right at her)
               Sometimes... I don't know if there's
               enough of me left to save.

     VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               Oh, God. I've got to have some
               coffee or something.

     A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. 
     Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.

     VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on 
     his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.

                              BRUCE
               Are you expecting anyone?

     She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Who's there?

     THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.

                              DELIVERY BOY
               Package tor Miss Vale.

                              BRUCE
               Set it down by the door. On the
               left-hand side.

     The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, 
     tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a 
     moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick 
     up the mysterious package.

     Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!

     He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets 
     it down on the kitchen counter.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               It's just like the last time. He
               sent me a present before he --

                              BRUCE
               Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

     As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds 
     his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a 
     LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then 
     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
               it around with you.

                              BRUCE
               I feel naked without it.

     He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a 
     stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the 
     earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
               Wait in the next room.

     He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then 
     SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.

     Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is 
     full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into 
     the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.

     In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.

     BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the 
     counter.

                              BRUCE
               ... They're wax.

     VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.

                              VICKI
               "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make
               up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.

                              BRUCE
                     (lost in thought)
               That does it. It's going to be this
               weekend.

     The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. 
     Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.

                              ALICIA
               I thought you ought to know -- he's
               coming for you... 

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the 
     mouthpiece with one hand.

                              BRUCE
               Keep her on the line!

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you calling from?

     As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE 
     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP 
     COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up 
     a telecommunications program.

     A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --

                              BRUCE
               Finding out where she is.

                              VICKI
               How can you do that if she's already
               off the line?

                              BRUCE
               I've had an automatic tracer on this
               number ever since he tracked you to
               the museum.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

     MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding, 
     INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name -- 
     ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.

                              BRUCE
               Got it!

                              VICKI
               What now!

                              BRUCE
               Hang on. I have to leave a message.

     HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key 
     to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on 
     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.

     The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the 
     elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas. 
     The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall 
     and march toward VICKI's apartment.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

     BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing 
     dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the 
     DOOR unlocking behind her.

     She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.

                              THUG I
               Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
               fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
               to --

     BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single 
     sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS 
     at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the 
     shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick 
     succession.

                              BRUCE
               There's a garage in this building?

     VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his 
     element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.

     She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK 
     NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is 
     full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I've got to take him out now.

     He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key 
     off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Pick an apartment and stay there.
               And listen: call the police. Give
               them that address. Every available
               man.

     He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a 
     dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.

     INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO 
     ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the 
     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.

     BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the 
     thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van, 
     his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING 
     DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.

     He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels 
     around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
     forgotten something.

                              BRUCE
               Oh, hell!

     The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the 
     elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that 
     something is amiss.

                              GOON
               Hey, boss, something's up. The
               elevator's working.

     INT. VAN - ON JOKER

     Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.

                              JOKER
               DAMMIT! You can't get good help
               these days. -- Let's move out.

     EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling 
     out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE. 
     He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL 
     LIGHT begins to flash.

     BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the 
     BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's 
     BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.

     EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual. 
     But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky, 
     staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.

     Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow 
     belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the 
     intersection on a ROPE.

     INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER

     The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on 
     either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:

                              JOKER
               Slow down, you maniac!

     EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. 
     His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just 
     about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING 
     MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands 
     directly behind him on the horse's back.

     BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. 
     The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through 
     the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, 
     UNMARKED CARS are converging.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They 
     see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.

                              DRIVER
               Boss! Jesus! They've --

                              JOKER
               They'll be sorry. They'll be
               sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, 
     drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the 
     FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.

     EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

     INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

     We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat 
     beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the 
     city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect 
     sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

     BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING 
     TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its 
     hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --

     -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, 
     neatly tied in string.

     BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick 
     salute -- and the BUG is gone.

     INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING

     The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the 
     southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are 
     everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for 
     the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.

                              JOKER
               MOVE! Can't you do something??

                              DRIVER
               It's some kind of detour. They're
               backed up for blocks!

     The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view 
     mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.

                              JOKER
               Oh my God. How does he do it... ?

     EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT

     THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET 
     ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around 
     the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, 
     RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first 
     opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO 
     GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.

     BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on 
     the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from 
     overhead.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING

     CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the 
     FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:

                              EMCEE
               -- the most spectacular, most death-
               defying aerial stunt ever devised.
               Tonight -- for the first time
               anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!

     He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying 
     side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the 
     twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING 
     GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled 
     red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other 
     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL

     PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the 
     crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.

     On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He 
     lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly 
     against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- 
     driving it off the access road down into the brush, where 
     it nearly topples over sideways.

     ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS

     GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, 
     landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're 
     swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make 
     the return leap back to his own trapeze.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, 
     compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, 
     he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's 
     got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.

                              PILOT
               Ready to go, Dick?

                              DICK
               What's all the ruckus down there?

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding 
     trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its 
     side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER - 
     FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."

     The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.

                              JOKER
               Head for the truck!

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the 
     JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back 
     of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER

     THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a 
     massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of 
     BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!

     THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an 
     expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.

                              JOKER
               I love fireworks!

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past. 
     One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON 
     falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER 
     plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.

     MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and 
     weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a 
     wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER 
     veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously 
     close to the tall buildings along the avenue.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a 
     canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings 
     into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.

                              DICK
               NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!

     His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT 
     struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding 
     a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before 
     THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED 
     OUT OF THE COPTER.

     ANGLE ON DICK

     With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A 
     FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a 
     nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down. 
     And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --

     -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended 
     target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun 
     and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the 
     chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF 
     A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.

     ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists 
     his chrome spear over the windshield.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT 
     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES 
     CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up 
     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads 
     "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken 
     off!

     ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across 
     the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over 
     a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet, 
     ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm 
     around his waist.

                              DICK
               LET ME GO! LET ME --

     THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with 
     MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the 
     GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.

                              DICK (cont.)
               YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--

     DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his 
     hands full restraining the kid.

                              JOKER
               Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
               hot.
                     (glowering at BATMAN)
               Hands off the belt.

                              BATMAN
               Take me. Let the boy go.

                              JOKER
               Gosh, I could kill you, but then
               you'd miss my party. And I'd be
               real, real sad if you couldn't make
               it.

                              BATMAN
               What are you talking about?

                              JOKER
               Batman! Don't you even recognize
               your old pal Jack? After all... 
                     (cackling insanely)
               You made me what I am today.

     BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS 
     BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the 
     crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the 
     night.

     DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to 
     the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.

                              DICK
               HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
               MY --

     BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into 
     his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE 
     under DICK's nose.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. 
     COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.

                              REPORTER
               ... on a tip attributed to the
               mysterious Batman. The apartment was
               booby-trapped with the Joker's
               laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
               dead.
                     (beat)
               Also found dead at the scene was
               Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --

     CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of 
     BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other 
     screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.

     We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, 
     showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER 
     and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate 
     transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads 
     into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, 
     as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
     Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.

     Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
     flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE 
     CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.

     And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head 
     in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
     responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
     he would just as soon be dead.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, 
     unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.

     Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his 
     unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.

                              DICK
               ... Where am I?

                              BRUCE
               My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
               welcome to stay here as long as you
               want.

     BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast 
     tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on 
     here?

     INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT 
     march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.

                              DENT
               We'll send a team into Ace the
               moment the warrant comes through.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be ready when you do. Remember
               what happened at the apartment.

                              DENT
               All right, Bruce, what do you
               suggest?

                              BRUCE
               I suggest a nice big bomb.

                              DENT
               Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
               Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.

                              BRUCE
               Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
               the anniversary celebration.

                              DENT
               We've told him we'll deal. What
               could he possibly have to gain by --

                              BRUCE
               Do you still think the Joker cares
               about money??

                              DENT
               I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
               don't have access to all your
               expert sources.

     Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back 
     a moment, then turns down the hall.

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long 
     driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED 
     INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, 
     then climbs out and towels himself off.

     He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable 
     in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could 
     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray 
     bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and 
     tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's 
     costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway 
     behind him.

                              DICK
               ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
               so I figured I'd hoof it.

                              BRUCE
               Sorry. I can't let you leave.

                              DICK
               You can't keep me here, man. That's
               kidnapping.

                              BRUCE
               If I let you leave, you'll do the
               same thing again. You'll go after
               the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
                     (turning to go)

                              DICK
               Hey, man. Look at you. You're
               rich. You got everything you want.
               How do you know what's in my mind?

     BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are 
     filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.

                              BRUCE
               I don't care what's in your mind.
               You're staying.

     BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the 
     kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding 
     speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up 
     spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.

     DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a 
     move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.

     A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with 
     a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of 
     motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's 
     chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up 
     curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle 
     royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. 
     He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. 
     Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... 
     who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.

     A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:

                              DICK
               ... You're him.

     No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly... 

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               FREEZE!

     DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler 
     stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance, 
     a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.

                              BRUCE
               It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
               under control.

                              ALFRED
               ... Very good, sir.

     ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

     CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift 
     STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.

                              JOKER
               Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
               I'm here to tell you... we have had
               one helluva quarter.

     He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable 
     easels.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
               fear's gone straight through the
               roof. You guys should be proud --
               'cause I couldn'ta done it without
               each and every one of you!

     MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I feel it's time to expand the
               Joker line. I was askin' myself,
               what are the products that every
               consumer wants most? And that's when
               it hit me: the water you drink, and
               the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
                     (strutting across stage)
               Now, some of you have your eye on
               the profit margin. You're thinkin':
               this boy's too ambitious. You
               don't approve. In fact, some of you
               have been talking about turning me
               in to the cops. Or knocking me off.

     He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But that's okay. I understand. Not
               everyone shares my eye for beauty.
               And just to show there's no hard
               feelings, I'm throwin' a little
               shindig tonight -- and you're all
               invited!

     THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the 
     Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins, 
     no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
     living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling 
     corpses.

     One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.

                              JOKER
               Look at that, folks. We got 'em
               rolling in the aisles!

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK

     VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on 
     the pillows. BRUCE is in his robe over by the window, 
     looking out at his estate.

                              BRUCE
               All this apparatus, Vicki... this
               house, and the money, and the
               power... it was never mine. It was
               something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
               was something I inherited.
                     (pause)
               All I ever hoped for was someone who
               could see through Bruce -- who could
               see me -- and not be frightened.

                              VICKI
               I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
               I'm frightened for you.

                              BRUCE
               In all these years... why couldn't I
               see how it would turn out?

     He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now 
     she's truly afraid.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
               for me, there'd be no Joker.

     INT. BATCAVE - EVENING

     TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel 
     casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER. 
     BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver, 
     hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30. 
     29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
     countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his 
     utility belt.

     He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape 
     and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the 
     shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.

                              BRUCE
               Where's the boy?

                              ALFRED
               Upstairs. He's quite docile.

                              BRUCE
               I know that feeling. It won't last.

     BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks 
     on tremulously.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               He's a long way ahead of where I was
               at his age.
                     (taking ALFRED's
                      shoulders)
               I want you to treat him just as if
               he were me. Promise.

                              ALFRED
               Yes, sir.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be taken care of financially.
               Beyond that... you know what to do.
               Don't let all this go to waste.

     Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to 
     speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long 
     circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne 
     Manor. On the third step he pauses:

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Alfred? -- Thank you.

     As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies 
     himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

     BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current 
     time is 7:09 PM.

     He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, 
     and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep, 
     regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later, 
     BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.

     Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.

     At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing 
     closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME, 
     twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of 
     R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.

     HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the 
     clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with 
     its grating electronic WHINE.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

     The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage 
     point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out 
     the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up 
     the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights 
     off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's 
     forces.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge 
     shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with 
     a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot 
     outside.

                              DISPATCHER
               Boston, Philly: loading bay one.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR 
     and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and 
     taking half the chain-link fence with it.

     In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the 
     BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A 
     ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the 
     factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole 
     in the door.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and 
     SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are 
     everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and 
     PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

     CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass 
     dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and 
     COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It 
     doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving.

     TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny 
     voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:

                              COMPUTER
               ... Detonate.

     A beat. Then: BLAM.

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing 
     to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS 
     dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.

     All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.

                              COP
                    Good Lord!

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking 
     lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. 
     For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

     All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble 
     and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT

     DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham 
     Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming 
     stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, 
     ready to be unveiled.

     THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of 
     Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
     talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the 
     Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as 
     the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's 
     just another part of the celebration.

     At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a 
     microphone:

                              GOVERNOR GILROY
               As Governor of this great state, it
               is now my honor to unveil for you a
               very special lady -- a lady who
               stands tall for life and liberty --
               America's favorite lady... LADY
               GOTHAM!

     The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY 
     GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's 
     Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair 
     of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: 
     hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the 
     canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... 

     ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
     WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!

     Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE 
     SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS 
     ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: 
     the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the 
     stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD 
     stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.

     And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS 
     GOING DARK.

     EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT

     QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different 
     points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a 
     PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:

                              JOKER (V.O.)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
               little token of my esteem. HAVE
               FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!

     INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S 
     HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to 
     earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS 
     try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another 
     in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT 
     DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb 
     out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.

     DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED 
     COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, 
     DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled 
     subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.

     On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a 
     field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless 
     against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.

     FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats 
     and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of 
     an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... 
     only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a 
     SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild 
     street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
     her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.

                              KNOX
               VICKI!

     VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's 
     wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
               girl could get hurt this way.

                              VICKI
               Yeah. Deja vu.

                              KNOX
               What do you say? Let's head for the
               lights.

     In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS 
     are sweeping the sky.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
     huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
     portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.

     On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the 
     street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if 
     nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block  
     intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS 
     BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical 
     figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.

     The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN -- 
     smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We 
     TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT... 

     ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
     queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily 
     at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like 
     some demented parade marshal.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints 
     on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the 
     legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."

     Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT

     The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously 
     TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A 
     STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.

     THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift, 
     sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS 
     EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to 
     release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER

     The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the 
     reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and 
     wonder what to do next.

     They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a 
     sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they 
     HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE 
     TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and 
     destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN

     in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the 
     wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham 
     skyline.

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT

     FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE 
     FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.

     Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character 
     UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on 
     itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the 
     street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts 
     downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon 
     blimp EXPLODES.

                              KNOX
               So much for Underdog.

     THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all 
     at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK 
     SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to 
     engulf the entire block!

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

                              KNOX
               WHAT HAPPENED?!?

     VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up 
     the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!

                              VICKI
               Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
               got the balloons rigged with
               compressor tanks!!

                              KNOX
               Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets. 
     He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES. 
     At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling 
     to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT 
     streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.

                              VICKI
               LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
                     (frantically)
               Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
               find some way to tell him!

                              KNOX
               Great. How??

     They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS 
     SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES 
     and SKIDS TO A HALT.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               COME ON!

     EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT

     Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from 
     the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He 
     flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.

     It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in 
     party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that 
     current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.

     As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy 
     out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And 
     DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.

     Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT 
     TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.

                              KNOX
               GIMME A HAND UP HERE!

     VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of 
     the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel 
     assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... 

     ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its 
     massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in 
     the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.

     BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.

     EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing 
     MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on 
     the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE 
     CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.

     He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints 
     bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed 
     inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is 
     BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... 

     ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! 
     The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE 
     TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring 
     through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to 
     the ground!

                              JOKER
               No... NOOOOO!!!

     ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON

     as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in 
     the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it 
     now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it 
     disperses harmlessly in the wind.

     EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the 
     rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds 
     it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; 
     hits a button repeatedly... 

     ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The 
     damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
     fit of pique.

     A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back 
     for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of 
     twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.

     CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS 
     sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on 
     helplessly, in stunned disbelief.

     As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON 
     THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.

                              JOKER
               There. There. -- GET 'EM!!

     ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK

     A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX 
     throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the 
     spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.

                              KNOX
               GET THE CAR!

     The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the 
     Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps 
     off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of 
     rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.

     GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.

     INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

     KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL 
     LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally 
     exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.

                              KNOX
               HOLY SHIT!!

                              VICKI
               You okay?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
               SEE THAT?!

                              VICKI
                     (laughing wildly)
               God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
               that was the ballsiest move I
               ever --

                              KNOX
                     (ecstatic)
               Holy shit. Holy --

     He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between 
     his lips -- and BURSTS.

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!!

     His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He 
     looks down in genuine bewilderment.

                              KNOX
               Jesus, Vicki.

     That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and 
     slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the 
     street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

     EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

     In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, 
     past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the 
     one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear 
     through a CONCEALED HATCH.

     WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE 
     mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the 
     parade decorations. And one moment later... 

     A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a 
     burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, 
     leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops 
     low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he 
     streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
     SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The 
     JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
     him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips 
     through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and 
     BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN 
     stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's 
     clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.

     He's coming back for more!

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.

                              JOKER
               He'll be back... he'll be back!!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING

     The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full 
     speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either 
     side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The 
     REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO 
     FLAME!

     The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the 
     tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps 
     the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF 
     THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of 
     the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.

     And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as 
     the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE 
     OPEN!

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in 
     the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS 
     groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and 
     the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE 
     SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A 
     hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and 
     pulls himself up to the street.

     He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the 
     BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt 
     SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the 
     tunnel.

                              JOKER
               You do him. I'm outta here.

     The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They 
     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the 
     Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN... 
     inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.

     A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for 
     their guns, move in warily... 

                              VOICE
               Yo.

     The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of 
     motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and 
     green --

     -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only 
     one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a 
     red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS 
     and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot 
     or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the 
     plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.

     TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in 
     place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
     like haze, A HAND extended toward him:

                              DICK
               HEY! COME ON!

     And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming 
     wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an 
     extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in 
     agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath 
     him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.

                              DICK
               Now we're even, huh? Even up.

                              BATMAN
               How did you... 

                              DICK
               I hitched. MOVE IT!

     DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO 
     FLAME behind them.

                              BATMAN
               The Joker. Is he --?

                              DICK
               Forget it. Relax.
                     (beat)
               ... He's mine now.

     DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.

                              BATMAN
               DICK!

     THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is 
     unendurable. His body has finally failed him.

     He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as 
     DICK races off with murder in his eyes.

     EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky, 
     piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is 
     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old 
     abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.

                              JOKER
               Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.

     HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER 
     forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, 
     hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
     glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all 
     forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders 
     about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.

     DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear 
     pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS 
     at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS 
     DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.

     In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER 
     finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden 
     stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and 
     starts up.

     DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back 
     of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor, 
     unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA 
     WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.

     Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED 
     BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center 
     aisle of the old cathedral.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

     A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the 
     wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.

     The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on 
     the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:

                              JOKER
               I'm in the belltower. Don't land.

     INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT

     A PILOT replies through his radio headset.

                              PILOT
               E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.

     The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.

     INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls 
     himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
     Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.

     Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps 
     against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his 
     utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule 
     back onto his dry, swollen tongue.

     Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and 
     TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten 
     wood of the belltower stairs.

     THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. 
     And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN 
     MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.

     It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the 
     fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, 
     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.

     Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. 
     His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN 
     INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.

     For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED 
     WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, 
     trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last 
     ounce of strength.

     The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. 
     BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.

     He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility 
     belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making 
     earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at 
     his side.

     THE BATMAN is out like a light.

     INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering 
     what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves 
     cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... 
     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.

                              JOKER
               ... Batman?

     No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little 
     snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of 
     his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on 
     his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS 
     BATMAN up into the belltower.

     He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. 
     The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- 
     pats his face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Batman? Batman?

     THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I thought you'd be more comfortable
               here in the belfry.
                     (chuckling to himself)
               Before I kill you I'd like to see
               who you are. Would that be okay?

     BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes 
     and reaches over to undo his cowl.

     BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The 
     JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, 
     moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh my, aren't we pretty.
                     (brightening suddenly)
               I know you! You're the rich boy!!

     The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps 
     his hands together in sheer glee.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               My goodness, what in the world made
               you do it? It must've been
               something pretty terrible!

     He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You know, we should've sat down and
               had us a little heart-to-heart. I
               bet we would have got on famously.

                              BATMAN
               Mad... man... 

                              JOKER
               Well now, you're not exactly the
               picture of mental health, are you.

                              BATMAN
               ... Murderer... 

                              JOKER
               Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
               how many people you've killed by
               letting me live.

     A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his 
     helicopter approaching in the distance.

     BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his 
     utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.

     The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens 
     it gingerly.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
               won't even hurt. Now relax. The
               bat's in his belfry, all's right
               with the world... 

     He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE 
     reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER 
     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Why, Bruce... 

     Then he hears ticking.

     Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 
     0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.

     He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.

     BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch 
     convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

     BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!

                              BRUCE
               No... sense... of humor?

     The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks 
     better of it and retracts his shaking hand.

     He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the 
     clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his 
     signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.

     The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on 
     the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down 
     the stairs in a frenzy.

     There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and 
     counting.

     Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and 
     makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly 
     overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.

     EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT

     The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a 
     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD 
     LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost 
     losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures 
     wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.

     EXT. BELLTOWER

     A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves 
     -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of 
     the old cathedral --

     -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air 
     like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
     blind uncomprehending fury --

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, 
     cackles in mad triumph --

     -- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING 
     SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE 
     ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER --

     -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

     -- and plunges into the night.

     TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if 
     he makes his choice now.

     Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body 
     working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches 
     into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.

     It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.

     INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT

     The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just 
     enough to see what's going on.

                              CO-PILOT
               PULL UP!! PULL --

     EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly 
     silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies 
     splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the 
     churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in 
     the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE 
     FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.

     Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. 
     Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.

     POV JOKER

     Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, 
     bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the 
     sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE

     It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost 
     childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, 
     though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins 
     to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness 
     sets in.

                                               FADE THROUGH TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               As the details of the Joker's
               heinous plan become known, a city's
               gratitude goes out to the mysterious
               Batman. His whereabouts remain
               unknown, but Batman -- if you're
               alive -- if you're listening --
               thank you.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT 
     in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine 
     it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping 
     flowers.

                              VICKI
               I loved you too.

     As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she 
     gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.

     The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY

     ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.

                              ALFRED
               No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm
               afraid he's quite unreachable.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized 
     SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.

     In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. 
     Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping 
     him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.

                              VICKI
               I don't know why I'm doing this. I
               half wish you'd stay a cripple.

                              BRUCE
               Ohhhh... you don't mean that.

                              VICKI
                     (grasping for words)
               I don't, but... I do. It's just... I
               love you, Bruce. I --

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or
               all of me?

     A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for 
     several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.

                              VICKI
               I guess you did it, didn't you. You
               saved everyone.
                     (pause)
               Almost.

     For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls 
     her over, takes her in a tight embrace.

                              BRUCE
               I don't know how to explain this so
               it makes sense... but you saved
               me.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and 
     looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets 
     his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation -- 
     LEAPS INTO THE VOID.

     His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE 
     AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the 
     rings on his way down.

     Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the 
     pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOFTOP - GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

     A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the 
     distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling 
     finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at 
     the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.

     A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his 
     RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN 
     SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through 
     the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a 
     BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.

     We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN 
     vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new 
     adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we

     FADE IN:

     EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

     The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.

     The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, 
     dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and 
     concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its 
     aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
     kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready 
     to burst.

     EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic 
     anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- 
     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.

     On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from 
     their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch 
     over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the 
     Gotham night.

     One of them is moving.

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

     The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of 
     big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. 
     Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
     fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
     each other... with one conspicuous exception:

     A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring 
     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the 
     main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks 
     over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and 
     now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in 
     the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

                              MOM
               For God's sake, Harold, can we
               please just get a taxi??

                              DAD
               I'm trying to get a --
                     (shouting)
               TAXI!!

     Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in 
     frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.

                              JIMMY
               We're going the wrong way.

     Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys 
     them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.

                              DAD
               Put that away. We'll look like
               tourists.

     TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night 
     souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. 
     The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks 
     him off down the street and glowers at DAD.

                              DAD (cont.)
               We'll never get a cab here. Let's
               cut over to Seventh.

                              JIMMY
               Seventh is that way.

                              DAD
               I know where we are!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of 
     stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath 
     and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.

                              VOICE
               Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

     The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, 
     acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm 
     uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'

     MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then 
     move on -- pretending not to hear.

                              DERELICT
               Mister. How about it. One dollar?
                     (standing up)
               One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
               Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
               English??

     By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. 
     Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.

     They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE 
     in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand 
     brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.

     DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick 
     wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across 
     the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's 
     already searching for DAD's wallet.

     MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to 
     snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his 
     gun on JIMMY.

                              STREET PUNK
               Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
               scream.

     The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her 
     face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to 
     shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.

     The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, 
     slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down 
     on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

                              NICK
                     (emptying the wallet)
               All right. The Gold Card.
                     (tossing the credit card
                     in EDDIE's face)
               Don't leave home without it.

     A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the 
     cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct 
     CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

                              EDDIE
               Let's beat it, man. I don't like
               being up here.

                              NICK
               What, scared of heights?

                              EDDIE
               I dunno, man. After what happened to
               Johnny Gobs --

                              NICK
               Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
               walked off a roof, all right? No big
               loss.

                              EDDIE
               That ain't what I heard. That ain't
               what I heard at all.
                     (beat)
               I heard the bat got him.

                              NICK
               Gimme a break, will you? Shut up... 

                              EDDIE
               Five stories, straight down. There
               was no blood in the body.

                              NICK
               No shit. It was all over the
               pavement.

     NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the 
     roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight 
     tingle at the base of his spine... 

                              EDDIE
               There was no blood, man.
                     (beat)
               My brother says... all the bad things
               you done... they come back and
               haunt you... 

                              NICK
               Listen to this. How old are you?
               There ain't no bat.

                              EDDIE
               My brother's a priest, man.

                              NICK
               No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
               Now shut up.
                     (conclusively)
               There ain't no bat.

     As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the 
     opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away... 
     where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is 
     dropping slowly, implacably, into frame... 

                              EDDIE
               You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
               that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

                              NICK
               Do you want this money or don't
               you? Now shut up! Shut up --

     BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of 
     BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS 
     DROP.

     Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a 
     BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.

     EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his 
     throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK 
     FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS: 
     GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.

     NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.

     And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate, 
     menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval 
     yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... 

     NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure 
     is knocked bodily to the roof.

     Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He 
     whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --

                              NICK (cont.)
               I'm gettin' outta here.

     -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a 
     strange, pre-verbal squeal... 

     ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, 
     NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

     Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters 
     out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of 
     the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches 
     for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to 
     the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.

     EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face 
     drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes 
     out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --

     -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --

     -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a 
     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, 
     weightless puppet.

     THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES 
     NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES 
     past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... 

     A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches 
     forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming 
     now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming 
     figure of the BAT at his heels... 

     ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against 
     the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He 
     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.

     Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he 
     could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling 
     on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to 
     pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails... 

     THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with 
     supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.

                              NICK (cont.)
               Don't kill me... don't kill me... 

     When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is 
     standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at 
     arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.

     The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:

                              BATMAN
               I won't kill you. I want you to do
               me a favor.

     NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

     He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where 
     BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own 
     stricken face.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Tell your friends. Tell all your
               friends.

     NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves 
     him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, 
     without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE 
     ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.

     Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over... 
     finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

     NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow 
     globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

                              BATMAN

     INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

     An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM. 
     HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find 
     the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT, 
     addressing a crowd from behind his podium.

                              DENT
               ... it is no longer enough to go
               after the small-time punks and petty
               criminals who infest the streets of
               Gotham City. Crime and corruption
               must be attacked at the root!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. 
     They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled 
     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're 
     going to enjoy this.

     Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling 
     water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- 
     the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has 
     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.

     The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.

     ANGLE ON DENT

                              DENT
               If elected, my first act as district
               attorney will be to return an
               indictment against Boss Carl
               Grissom!

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. 
     Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place 
     reeks of money.

     In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.
     Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle 
     with extraordinary finesse.

     In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, 
     with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.

                              DENT
                     (on the TV screen)
               Together we can make Gotham city a
               safe place for decent people to live
               and work and play.

     THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, 
     turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck 
     sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the 
     middle.

                              JACK NAPIER
               Decent people shouldn't live here.
               They'd be much happier someplace
               else.

     JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to 
     Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost 
     feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his 
     appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.

     He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA 
     HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides 
     over in her negligee and snuggles up.

                              ALICIA
               Anything new?

                              JACK
               The usual gas. If this clown could
               lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
               had to kill him by now.

     ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She 
     begins knotting it playfully about his neck.

                              ALICIA
               If Grissom knew about us... he
               might kill you.

     JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts 
     back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a 
     nearby vanity.

                              JACK
               Don't think so, angel. I'm too
               valuable. That's the way I've
               planned it.
                     (pause)
               And besides, he doesn't know.

     JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands 
     in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted 
     hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.

                              ALICIA
               You look just fine, Jack.

     He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

                              JACK
               ... I didn't ask.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham 
     Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of 
     activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

     EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. 
     Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE 
     MEDIC.

                              MEDIC
               That one there won't say a word. The
               other one's raving his head off.

                              ECKHARDT
               Variety, huh? The spice of life.

     At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
     thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
     Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
     PATROLMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               They found him hugging a drainpipe.
               He was scared to come off the roof.

                              KNOX
               Great, but tell me: is this another
               you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
               the third one this week.

                              PATROLMAN
                     (testily)
               I dunno. What's "what"?

                              KNOX
               Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
               for a commendation.

     KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and 
     saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.

                              ECKHARDT
               Oh Christ, it's Knox.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, gents. This anything I should
               know about?

                              ECKHARDT
               Nothing out of the routine.

     At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
     fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.

                              NICK
               A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
               He wanted me to do him a favor...!

     KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade 
     disgusted looks.

                              KNOX
               No offense, boys, but these guys are
               seeing something up there.

                              ECKHARDT
               No comment. Print what you like.

                              KNOX
               Come on. One question. Is there a
               six-foot bat in Gotham City?

     KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts 
     in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:

                              KNOX (cont.)
               If so, is he on the police payroll?
               If so, what's he pulling down after
               taxes?

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. 
     He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling 
     across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the 
     dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.

     ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. 
     He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the 
     block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered 
     up alongside him.

     ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it 
     quickly in his coat.

                              JACK
               You didn't show up.

                              ECKHARDT
               We had another bat sighting.

                              JACK
               I'm sure that was vitally important.
               Listen: things are heating up.
               Someone is leaking information to
               Harvey Dent.

     ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
               problem --

                              JACK
               Eckhardt... our problems are your
               problems.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'll work on it.

     JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his 
     topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the 
     material between his fingers.

                              JACK
               Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
               ostentatious on a cop's salary,
               don't you think?

                              ECKHARDT
                     (knocking his hands away)
               I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
               you.

                              JACK
               You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
               should be thinking about the future.

     ECKHARDT laughs in his face.

                              ECKHARDT
               Ambition.
                     (nodding his head)
               Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
               that organization.

                              JACK
               And why's that?

                              ECKHARDT
               You're a psycho, friend. You're an
               A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
               it.

     JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The 
     fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.

     JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back 
     full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an 
     all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

     By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. 
     ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.

                              JACK
               Here. Use mine.

     JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in 
     ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT 
     to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the 
     stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.

     ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one 
     crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.

                              JACK (cont.)
               It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
               here is a good cop. A real good cop.
                     (pause; smiling)
               Inexpensive.

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and 
     fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. 
     ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his 
     hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.

                              KNOX
               What have you got for me, Jerry?

     JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, 
     fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption 
     at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in 
     approval.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
               on the fangs, huh?

     He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED 
     COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:

                              COLLEAGUE
               Hey Knox, you got a visitor.

                              KNOX
               I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
               dust him, okay?

                              COLLEAGUE
               This one you might want to dust
               yourself.

     Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops 
     in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. 
     The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a 
     WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, 
     her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.

                              KNOX
               ... Vicki Vale.

     The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock 
     of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls 
     KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.

                              VICKI
               How'd you know it was me?

                              KNOX
               Honey -- I would know any randomly
               selected square inch of Vicki
               Vale.
                     (grinning)
               If I had a good enough hint.

     He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears 
     the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Where the hell have you been?

                              VICKI
               A nice, restful vacation.

     She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of 
     glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn 
     corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.

                              KNOX
               God, a girl could get hurt doing
               this.

                              VICKI
               I do get hurt.

     She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long 
     fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then 
     points to the scar and adds, slyly:

                              KNOX
               Got any more of those?

                              VICKI
               Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
               here. What's new and hot in Gotham
               City?

                              KNOX
               It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
               foot bat that swoops out of the
               night and preys on evildoers.

                              VICKI
                     (laughing)
               Evildoers, huh? Big or small?

                              KNOX
               Small so far. I mean -- they don't
               allow bats in boardrooms, do they.

                              VICKI
               Speaking of which... I hear the
               notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
               big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
               law'n'order freak in the city's
               gonna be there.

     KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI 
     may have a purpose in all this.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --

     She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an 
     INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
                     (apprehensively)
               Got a date?

     She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. 
     KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, 
     nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
               loved you. Will you marry me?

                              VICKI
                     (straightening her clothes)
               No.

                              KNOX
               Well, I'm starving. Will you at
               least buy me a hamburger?

                              VICKI
               Yes, but please -- be gentle.

     Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

     A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. 
     This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power 
     perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City 
     rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.

     GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS 
     -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types 
     and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this 
     makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the 
     Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.

                              GRISSOM
               Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
               don't like the way this is shaping
               up.

     JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's 
     right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.

                              JACK
               We can always pop him. -- Or pop
               someone close to him.

                              LIEUTENANT
               Let's feed him to the bat.

     This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the 
     crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.

                              GRISSOM
               He's going after our front
               companies. Specifically Ace
               Chemical. Which would tie us
               in with Councilman Kane, Senator
               Miller... on up the line.
                     (pause)
               We have to clean out our files
               before the subpoena comes down.

                              LIEUTENANT
               How do we go? The usual fire?

                              GRISSOM
               I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
               office, remove the relevant
               documents... 

                              JACK
               "Industrial espionage."

                              GRISSOM
               That's right. And Jack --
                     (pause)
               I'd like you to handle this
               operation personally.

     JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the 
     deck. His hand freezes in midair.

                              JACK
               ... Me?

     At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA 
     HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. 
     She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.

                              GRISSOM
               Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
               mind waiting in the other room.

     ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side 
     door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.

                              JACK
               Why do you need me to handle a
               simple break-in?

                              GRISSOM
                     (emphatically)
               Because I want someone I can
               trust.

     JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the 
     fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.

     It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre 
     HOLE through its face.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               We'll work out the details later.
               But it's got to be soon. -- All
               right, that's all for now.

     GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers 
     behind a moment.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
               important job. I can't trust it to
               somebody who'll screw up.

                              JACK
               I understand.

                              GRISSOM
                     (smiling)
               Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.

     JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the 
     big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               My friend, your luck is just about
               to change.

     He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway 
     nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles 
     coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
     hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a 
     team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind, 
     not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor; 
     the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, 
     blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's 
     power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money 
     into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.

     DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies, 
     telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another 
     group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots 
     and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a 
     corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands 
     ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.

     A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of 
     champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.

                              KNOX
               How high up would you say that is?

                              ALFRED
               I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

                              KNOX
               You know, if you cut your bathroom
               in half, you'd have my apartment.

                              ALFRED
               Which bathroom is that, air?

                              KNOX
               The small one.

     KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later, 
     VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers 
     and hooks up with KNOX.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
               actually know all these people?

                              VICKI
               Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
                     (pause)
               I'm quoting.

     KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.

                              KNOX
               Yeah, I guess we move in different
               circles. -- Though I did meet a
               one-eyed pimp last week.

     ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

     Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent 
     in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into 
     his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.

     Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and 
     VICKI wander up alongside him.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner Gordon! What do you
               hear from our pointy-eared friend?

     KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his 
     fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.

                              GORDON
               Knox, for the ninth time, and you
               can quote me -- there is no bat.

                              KNOX
               Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
               one honest cop in Gotham city.

     HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a 
     friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.

                              DENT
               How's your luck, Jim?

                              KNOX
               Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
               winged vigilantes?

     DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.

                              DENT
               Mr. Knox, I think we have enough
               real problems in this city without
               worrying about ghosts and goblins
               and Halloween characters.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."  
     From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping 
     TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously 
     applying BLACK CAMOUFLAGE PAINT to his face. He could be 
     getting ready for a date.

     The van is parked outside a chain-link fence which 
     surrounds the Ace Chemical complex.

     JACK'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

     The SECURITY GUARD in a glass booth at the entrance to the 
     parking lot. ONE OF JACK'S BOYS creeps up behind the booth 
     and takes the GUARD out.

     INT. VAN - ON JACK

     He turns the key in the ignition, shifts into first.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     KNOX and VICKI are taking an unauthorized tour of BRUCE's 
     house, wandering through rooms decorated in wildly 
     divergent motifs, eyeing an astounding collection of 
     artworks and antiques from every corner of the world.

                              KNOX
               My question is, where does one man
               get all this junk.

                              VICKI
               All over the world. They say he
               spends most of the year overseas --
               until recently, anyway.

                              KNOX
               Holy shit... 

     KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... We found the arsenal.

     One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound 
     volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds. 
     Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords... 
     every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever 
     devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               This guy has just gotten
               interesting. What else do you know?

                              VICKI
               Just what I've heard. Rich.
               Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.

                              KNOX
               Likes to kill?

                              VICKI
                     (smiling)
               Women find him magnetic.

                              KNOX
               I bet they like him for his big
               charity balls.

                              VICKI
               That, and the sweet smell of two
               hundred million bucks.

                              KNOX
               Well, you know me. The more they've
               got, the less they're worth.
                     (scanning the room)
               This guy must be the most worthless
               man in America.

     Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.

                              BRUCE WAYNE
               You disappoint me. Why not the
               world?

     KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face 
     of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... 
     and intensely handsome.

                              KNOX
               I assume in my usual charming manner
               I've just insulted the host.
                     (extending a hand)
               Alexander Knox.

                              BRUCE
               Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
               I quite like it.

                              KNOX
               Great. Give me a grant.

                              BRUCE
               I might consider it if you introduce
               me to Miss Vale.

     KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she 
     is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:

                              KNOX
               "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
               redundant.

                              BRUCE
                     (to VICKI)
               You're just back from Corto Maltese.
               I saw your combat photos. Quite a
               departure for you.

                              VICKI
               That's intriguing. They haven't been
               published yet.

     BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.

                              BRUCE
               ... You have an extraordinary eye.

     He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial 
     instincts aroused, pipes up:

                              KNOX
               Some people think she has two.

     VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:

                              VICKI
               Don't mind my friend. He's a little
               nervous tonight.

     KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his 
     competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's 
     something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
     could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's 
     almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation 
     of charm.

     This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
     like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm 
     turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:

                              VICKI (cont.)
               This is an amazing house. I'd love
               to shoot it sometime.

                              BRUCE
               I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
               you be staying in Gotham for a
               while?

                              VICKI
               As far as I know.

                              BRUCE
               Good. Then with any luck we'll run
               into each other.

     Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind 
     them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.

                              ALFRED
               Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
               was compelled to leave -- very
               unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
               his regrets.

                              BRUCE
               Thank you, Alfred.
                     (to VICKI)
               I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
               great pleasure meeting you.
                     (to KNOX)
               And you.

     Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and 
     strides hurriedly out of the room.

                              KNOX
               I know the rich are different, but
               that guy is real different.

     VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Hello? Vicki?

                              VICKI
               Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.

                              KNOX
               What were you thinking?

                              VICKI
               Yum, yum.

                              KNOX
               Well, he must like the way he
               looks. He's got a mirror in every
               room.

     And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous 
     WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to 
     ceiling.

                              VICKI
               I get it. Bruce Vain.

     She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we

                                                 CUT TO:

     REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR

     looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- 
     as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording 
     everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, 
     state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

     showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
     reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a 
     whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control 
     center, we can see everything that's happening in the 
     house.

     Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward, 
     with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.

     At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
               Chemical Company.

                              GORDON
                     (obviously agitated)
               Good Lord, it we could put our hands
               on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
               about this? Who's in charge of
               the --

                              PATROLMAN
               Lt. Eckhardt, sir.

                              GORDON
               Eckhardt. Oh my God... 

     And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat. 
     The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights 
     off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing 
     out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.

     The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.

                              ECKHARDT
               Shoot to kill.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a 
     blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are 
     at work on the filing cabinets.

     The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal 
     door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:

                              SAFECRACKER
               ... Empty.

                              HOOD I
               Just like the file cabinets.

                              HOOD II
               I don't get it. If this place is
               cleaned out already, what do we need
               five men?

     JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny. 
     By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.

     Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares 
     outside.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT

     ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE 
     BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED 
     COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM. 
     ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.

                              ECKHARDT
               What are you trying to do, blow the
               collar?

                              GORDON
                     (to SWAT TEAM)
               You men are dismissed. We'll take
               over from here.
                     (to UNIFORMED COPS)
               Any man who opens fire on Jack
               Napier... will answer to me.

     ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               You. Stick around.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

     JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two 
     stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network 
     of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.

     Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.

                              COP
               Freeze!

     One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his 
     colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear 
     exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.

     ANGLE ON GORDON

     standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building 
     and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING 
     OUT as the HOODS scatter.

                              ECKHARDT
                     (snidely)
               Nice work, Commissioner.

                              GORDON
               I'm in charge here. Not Carl
               Grissom.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when 
     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant 
     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its 
     massive chest. BATMAN.

     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in 
     the opposite direction.

     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across 
     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a 
     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL 
     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, 
     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts 
     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS 
     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES 
     -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he 
     throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES 
     SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of 
     plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place 
     over giant basins.

     JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine 
     to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.

     ANGLE ON CATWALKS

     BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated 
     walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them 
     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.

     BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED 
     HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS 
     HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.

     HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his 
     ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. 
     A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.

     HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a 
     miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... 
     planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.

     ANGLE ON COPS

     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.

                              COP
               LOOK!

                              GORDON
               My God... it's him.

     ANGLE ON CATWALK

     HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. 
     BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III 
     with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.

     He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once 
     through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.

     Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the 
     HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB 
     UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE 
     STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK 
     to the factory floor forty feet below!

     INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

     JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; 
     STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking 
     lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting 
     for JACK to make his move.

     No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team 
     -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind 
     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.

     INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

     JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the 
     metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out 
     onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... 
     begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.

     COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last 
     pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.

     AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.

     INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

     COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses 
     out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN 
     FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.

     JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The 
     cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, 
     hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE 
     begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate 
     opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!

     Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If 
     JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting 
     shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to 
     his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.

     JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he 
     does --

     BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! 
     His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in 
     diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The 
     plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.

     An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm 
     around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED 
     STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... 

                              VOICE
               HOLD IT!

     In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind 
     the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

                              HOOD V
               Let him go or I'll do it.

     BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to 
     himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he 
     strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the 
     back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.

     All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. 
     HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he 
     waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.

     ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his 
     side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the 
     Commissioner plugged.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. 
     He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a 
     supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling 
     black currents of the East River... and freedom.

     He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 
     AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor 
     of the catwalk mere yards away.

     ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

     The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the 
     Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.

                              HOOD V
               Nobody makes a move. We go out
               clean.

                              JACK'S VOICE
               ECKHARDT!!

     ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands 
     poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops 
     ECKHARDT cleanly.

     The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a 
     NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at 
     the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- 
     a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.

     The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, 
     DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.

     AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. 
     JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. 
     BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

     JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

     A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized 
     pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.

                              GORDON
               NO!!

     But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, 
     totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The 
     COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN 
     into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING 
     ALL THE WAY.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Goddammit, we had him. We --

     And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention 
     focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle 
     warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS 
     ON HIS BELT.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Hold it right there, Mister.

     THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then 
     -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto 
     the factory floor.

     A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild 
     pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily 
     dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN 
     from view.

     A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling 
     cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.

                              COP
               LOOK!

     The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too 
     late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF 
     THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an 
     avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy 
     heights, safely out of range.

                              GORDON
               HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                              COP
               ... Who is this guy?

                              GORDON
               I don't know, but he's one hell of a
               showman.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the 
     illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the 
     chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky 
     deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the 
     oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

     As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck 
     swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER 
     -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

     A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we

                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe: "BAT 
     MAN FOILS ROBBERY. WHO IS MASKED VIGILANTE?"

     Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a 
     jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
               Don't tell me some lie you'll have
               to retract later.

     CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking 
     up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
               is getting ambitious. -- Why the
               dopey grin?

                              VICKI
               Guess who's got a date with Bruce
               Wayne.

                              KNOX
               Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
               and asked you for a date?... Shit.
                     (shouting)
               HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
                     (to VICKI)
               I want you to pay close attention to
               this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
               what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

     A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ, 
     60, is the society editor of the Globe.

                              MIRANDA
               You mean Mister One-Nighter?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
                     (to VICKI)
               Because that's the average length of
               his relationships with women.

                              MIRANDA
               The current record is almost two
               weeks. That cover girl -- what's her
               name? You must've shot her, Vicki --

                              KNOX
               Tell her about the peanuts.

                              VICKI
               Peanuts?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes
               through women.

                              MIRANDA
               Like Planter's Peanuts.

     VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.

                              VICKI
               Plain or roasted?
                     (standing up)
               Alex, I'm very flattered that you've
               gone out and done all this research.

                              KNOX
               Why?
                     (blushing suddenly)
               Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter.
               I'm curious. I do this for a living.
               -- What'd you tell him?

                              VICKI
               I told him yes.

     KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes 
     KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               You're awfully sweet to be
               concerned, but it's really not
               necessary. I'll call you, okay?

     She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.

                              KNOX
               ... What was that?

                              MIRANDA
               That was one of the most gracious
               fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure
               to watch. -- What a nice girl.

     KNOX, totally flustered, sighs and sinks into his chair.

                              KNOX
               Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. COASTLINE - DAY

     A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance, 
     closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.

     EXT. DECK - YACHT - DAY

     BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE 
     FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs, 
     soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.

                              VICKI
               Do you sail?

                              BRUCE
               Too much work. I'm not really the
               physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.

     ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of 
     drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches 
     for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin 
     over braided telephone cables.

                              VICKI
               You do a very convincing imitation.
                     (sipping her drink)
               Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?

     He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for 
     her to try a sip.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Ginger ale?

                              BRUCE
               Two drinks and I start swinging from
               the rooftops.
                     (beat)
               Tell me, Vicki. There's something
               I'm very curious about. What took
               you down to Corto Maltese?

                              VICKI
               ... I guess I needed a change.

                              BRUCE
               You were one of the most successful
               magazine photographers in the city.
               Everyone wanted you.

                              VICKI
               Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?

                              BRUCE
               Not since the shooting started.

                              VICKI
               We went there once when I was
               little. I played on the beach. And
               at nights -- they had a band -- I
               danced with my father on the hotel
               patio.
                     (shrugging)
               That was Corto Maltese. When the war
               broke out I had to go back. And I
               promised myself that this time... I
               wouldn't look away.

                              BRUCE
               What did you see?

                              VICKI
               ... Terror.

     The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. 
     VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.

                              BRUCE
               There's terror everywhere. Some
               types are just more -- familiar
               than others.

     For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his 
     familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
               know it all seems a million miles
               away, out here on the water, with
               all this --

                              BRUCE
               Insulation?

     VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she 
     can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.

                              VICKI
               Bruce, really, when I say these
               things I don't mean to criticize
               you.

                              BRUCE
               I think you see things very clearly.

                              VICKI
               I'm happy to talk about something
               else. I don't want to be depressing.

                              BRUCE
                     (smiling)
               Do you assume that if I know you
               better I won't like you as much?

     VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but 
     if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
               you like this with the other women
               you know? -- Because I just can't
               seem to get a handle on this
               conversation.

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
               ambiguous, I think you should put
               the most flattering possible
               interpretation on it. Because even
               if it doesn't sound that way... 
               that's how I'll mean it.

     Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's 
     also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before 
     she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

     Rigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big 
     crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile."

     WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in 
     the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although 
     most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA 
     #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above 
     the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.

     She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some 
     rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing 
     a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box.

     DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has 
     her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box.

     HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX

     BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and 
     whispers back.

     A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But 
     her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera 
     glasses SNAP SHUT.

     ANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3

     staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of 
     TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a 
     chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up.

                              VICKI
               -- but it's not fair. I'm half
               drunk and you're not even --

                              BRUCE
               Would you like me to take you home?

                              VICKI
               God. You would.
                     (sidling up to him)
               Come on, Bruce. I just want to get
               two drinks in you. As an
               experiment.

                              BRUCE
               Maybe we should just kiss.

                              VICKI
               ... We could try that.

     WIDER ANGLE

     BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry 
     hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite 
     walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to:

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole 
     near the Gotham docks.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect 
     in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of 
     an unlicensed gangland doctor.

     The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner 
     of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.

                              DOCTOR
               Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we
               did.

     He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:

     JACK NAPIER'S POV

     The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands 
     there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His 
     eyes bug out. He GAGS.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
     still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     ANGLE ON DOCTOR

     He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand 
     mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats. 
     Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to 
     the floor.

     JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.

                              DOCTOR
               You understand the facial muscles
               were completely severed --

     JACK keeps on laughing.

     The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at 
     his seedy equipment.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               -- you can see what I have to work
               with here --

     MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with 
     one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               I'm sure that with proper recon--
               recon-- reconstructive surgery --

     A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a 
     sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table.

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT

     From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the 
     alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head. 
     We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is 
     BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling.

     It's almost as though BRUCE is not used to sleeping at 
     night. He doesn't know what to do with himself.

     He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all 
     that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really 
     rather be somewhere else.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club 
     as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.

                              KID
                    Nice hair, dude!

     JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he 
     gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER -- 
     and strides deliberately across the street.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

     The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-
     glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the 
     private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in 
     the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.

                              GRISSOM (O.S.)
               That you, sugar bumps?

     GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. 
     He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his 
     impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his 
     hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up 
     figure at his desk.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Who the hell are you?

                              JACK
               It's me. "Sugar Bumps."

                              GRISSOM
                     (recognizing his voice)
               Jack?
                     (advancing cautiously)
               Thank God. I can't believe it's you.
               I heard you'd been --

                              JACK
                     (standing up)
               Is that what you "heard"?

     JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't 
     move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.

                              JACK (cont.)
               YOU SET ME UP!
                     (beat)
               Over a girl. You must be insane!

     GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

                              JACK (cont.)
               Keep your hands on the desk.

                              GRISSOM
               Sooner or later you would've tried
               to take me, Jack. You may get me
               now, but your life won't be worth a
               dime.

                              JACK
               I've died once already. It wasn't so
               bad. -- In fact I recommend it.

     GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK 
     is utterly, hopelessly deranged.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

                              JACK
               JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK??

     And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS 
     THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock 
     -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.

     His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous 
     seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from 
     the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, 
     PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

                              JACK (cont.)
               I'm not a Jack any more.
                     (pause; cackling)
               You made me a Joker!

     THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. 
     GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the 
     desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT
               LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

                              JACK
               HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

     And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires 
     again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.

     EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, 
     arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW 
     spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from 
     this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel 
     chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.

                              JOKER
               What a view. Our little city. It
               always brings a smile to my face.

     He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at 
     GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still 
     wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Guess it's my little city now.
               Wonder what it'll look like when I
               get done with it.
                     (pause)
               I bet it'll be something real fine.
               Real fine and pretty.

                                                 DISSOLVE T0:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A 
     SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent 
     bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."

     She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow 
     she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.

     INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING

     BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to 
     himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He 
     instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.

                              VICKI
               I didn't mean to scare you. I just
               had to come in here and see it that
               was really you singing.

     She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if 
     she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
                     (singing)
               "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to
               touch my cup." Come on. "You're my
               sugar --"
                     (no response from BRUCE)
               Bruce, you are such a case.

     BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly 
     recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost 
     childish smile.

                              BRUCE
               I don't sing very well.

                              VICKI
               Then there's one thing in the world
               you don't do very well. And I know
               what it is. -- Now you'll have to
               kill me.

     He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a 
     towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               Poor thing. You should stay off that
               horse.

     INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the 
     Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and 
     there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. 
     It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.

                              KNOX
                     (disgusted)
               ...Peanut.

     A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:

                              COPY BOY
               Here's that morgue file you wanted.

     KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE 
     WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf 
     through old clippings from back issues of the Globe.

     WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE 
     HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE 
     VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in 
     dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell 
     a rich philanthropist can be.

                              KNOX
               Come on. Gimme some dirt!

     Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of 
     clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two 
     partial exceptions.

     One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the 
     camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an 
     ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair 
     down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN 
     1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... Why don't you like your picture
               taken?

                                                   CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT

     A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's 
     apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the 
     glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, 
     peering inside, hesitant to enter.

     As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, 
     tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's 
     almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her.

                              DOORMAN
               Miss Hunt!
                     (smiling)
               No need to sneak in. The rent's been
               taken care of.

                              ALICIA
               ... The rent? Paid?

     INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ALICIA, mystified, lets herself in and turns to lock the 
     door. She's startled once more by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

                              VOICE
               Honey -- I'm home!

     She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

     Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on 
     his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket 
     and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.

     This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a 
     dead faint.

     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY

     It looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. At a 
     long table sit Gotham's most distinguished criminals: 
     GANGLORDS and RACKETS BOSSES from every corner of the city. 
     They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.

                              JOKER (O.S.)
               So that's how it is, gents. Until
               Grissom decides it's safe to come up
               for air... I'm running the show.

     Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather 
     flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with 
     flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.

     Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.

                              GANG BOSS
               So why don't we hear this from
               Grissom?

                              RACKETEER
               I got something I'd like to know.
               How come you're wearing that stupid
               smirk?

                              JOKER
               'Cause I got an army, chum. And I
               got Grissom's army. And this city
               is mine.

     CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:

                              ROTELLI
               I don't like taking orders, from
               Grissom. And I especially don't like
               taking orders from Grissom's goon.

                              JOKER
               I've considered that possibility.

                              ROTELLI
               And what happens if we say no?

                              JOKER
                     (chuckling)
               Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we
               can't do business, we shake hands
               and part friends.

                              ROTELLI
               That's it?

                              JOKER
               That's it.

     THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it. 
     He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's 
     palm.

     40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back 
     into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his 
     sleeves and shirt collar.

     The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a 
     move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Looks like Carmine got a little hot
               under the collar.

                              CRIMELORD
               ... You're insane!

     The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and 
     mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE 
     FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

                              JOKER
               That's what they said about Lee
               Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
               THINK IT OVER!

     The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE 
     JOKER alone in the room with the charred corpse of ROTELLI. 
     THE JOKER sinks into a chair and -- as is his wont -- 
     ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Heck, they're not such bad guys. I
               say we give 'em a couple of days to
               come around.
                     (thoughtful pause)
               We-e-ll... maybe one day.
                     (then, casually)
               Aaah, screw it. Let's grease 'em.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. SMALL BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A poker game. A CRIMELORD from the JOKER's board meeting 
     picks up his hand and fans out the cards. FIVE JOKERS.

     He looks up, puzzled. The last thing he sees is a HIRED 
     KILLER bursting in through the door, GUN IN HAND.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - DAY

     A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from 
     a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2 
     strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be 
     politely refuses.

     THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But, 
     as we quickly find out, it's not a helium tank -- it's a 
     FLAMETHROWER.

     EXT. HALLIDAY PLAZA - DAY

     A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate 
     skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many 
     nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all 
     smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.

                              VICKI
               ... To tell you the truth, I'd just
               about given up waiting.

                              BRUCE
               I said I'd call you the minute I got
               free. And I did. -- And here we are.

                              VICKI
                     (teasing him)
               Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.

     He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki. Do you want the whole truth?
               All coyness aside?
                     (long pause)
               I wish I had more time to give you.
               Every day I don't see you, I miss
               you.
                     (beat)
               Now. Are you going to waste this
               lovely afternoon being all mad at
               me?

     All this, of course, is delivered with devastating 
     sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.

                              VICKI
               Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so
               much like someone I used to... 
                     (stopping suddenly)
               Bruce? I know this is silly, but --
               you're not married, are you?

     He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT

     PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- 
     enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way 
     along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.

                              VICKI
               All street mimes should be executed.

                              BRUCE
               ... Looks like a convention.

     And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging 
     on the center of the plaza.

     RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a 
     skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the 
     passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.

     A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME 
     reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.

     SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.

     VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's 
     HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT 
     with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:

     -    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY 
          and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding 
          the CROWD at bay;

     -    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully 
          imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;

     -    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as 
          OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... 

     ... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for 
     a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in 
     the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's 
     just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.

     He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, 
     CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's 
     practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible 
     anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

     A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.

     ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS

     BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.

     ANGLE ON BRUCE

     his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood 
     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's 
     almost as if the bullets are striking him.

     A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI 
     emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the 
     wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.

     As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- 
     with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks 
     up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so 
     desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!!

     He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's 
     eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.

                              BRUCE
               Oh my God... are you all right?

     He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.

     He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, 
     pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her 
     face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

               Ricorso's death is the third in a
               rash of underworld killings... 

     CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
               Commissioner, you've heard the
               rumors. Are these murders the work
               of the mysterious 'Batman'?

     A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the 
     TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big 
     desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.

                              JOKER
               All reet! I think it's about time
               we called another meeting, huh?

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand.

                              ALFRED
               I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him
               your messages. That's all I can do.

     ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously 
     distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY

                              VICKI
               Please tell him... I'm not trying to
               make his life difficult. I'd just --
               I'd just like to know what's going
               on.

     A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, 
     finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd
               like you to see.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- 
     all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins 
     cranking through back-issue newspapers.

                              KNOX
               Okay, here we go. Check it out.

     He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A 
     FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:

                      THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
            Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
            Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

     Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics 
     with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE 
     WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.

     The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask 
     of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.

                              VICKI
               Oh my God... I've seen this picture.

                              KNOX
               I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.

                              VICKI
               His face. Allie, look at his face.

     TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and 
     disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years 
     -- permanently, indelibly traumatized. The same face VICKI
     saw in Halliday Plaza.

                              KNOX
               Yep. He watched the whole thing
               happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
               Jim Gordon.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce... 

                              KNOX
               Something like this -- what do you
               suppose this could drive a guy to?

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     A greasy spoon off the lobby of the Globe building. KNOX
     and VICKI in a booth.

                              VICKI
               Alexander, you are on drugs.

                              KNOX
               He walks out on his own party. Half
               an hour later, the Caped Crusader
               turns up in full bat-drag.
                     (beat)
               Sees an execution, freaks out in an
               alleyway. No place to change.
                     (smiling)
               Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all
               right.

                              VICKI
               You're pissing me off, Allie. I know
               exactly why you're doing this.

                              KNOX
                     (leaning forward)
               Oh? Why is that, Vicki?

     VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for 
     a second, then changes the subject.

                              VICKI
               He's best friends with Jim Gordon
               and Harvey Dent. They would know.

                              KNOX
               ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession
               to make. I'm the Batman.

     VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Don't believe me? Why not?

                              VICKI
               Alexander... I know you.

                              KNOX
               Right. And they know him. And
               that's why it would never occur to
               them for a minute that their old
               buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night
               and goes out looking for --

                              VICKI
               This is pointless. I'm leaving.

                              KNOX
                     (grabbing her arm)
               Your little chum is out of his mind.
                     (relaxing his grip)
               Next time you call him up and he
               can't go out Friday night -- think
               it over.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - DAY

     LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above 
     the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing 
     production like a demented middle manager.

     INT. STOREROOM - DAY

     A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical, 
     which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-
     LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.

     CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping 
     manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.

     More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-
     seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the 
     initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.

     Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS: 
     RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title 
     page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'

     And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and
     orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing 
     HIDEOUS, CHEMICAL-INDUCED GRIMACES.

     ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.

     ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic 
     reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half 
     HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.

     The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the 
     floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.

                              JOKER
               How's that first shipment coming?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Right on schedule. Oh, we got that
               address for you -- 79 East End,
               #12-C.

                              JOKER
               Mmm. How'd you find it?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Called her agent.

     The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the 
     floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and 
     scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible 
     scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.

     One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of 
     Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a 
     massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.

     We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in 
     Corto Maltese.

     INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

     In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion: 
     mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN 
     BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.

     In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend, 
     CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.

                              CLAIRE
               ... of course, after Corto Maltese,
               this must all seem pretty tame.

                              VICKI
               Not to me. I need a job.

                              CLAIRE
               Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've
               got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.

                              VICKI
               Then "everyone" must know something
               I don't.

                              CLAIRE
                     (cattily)
               Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on,
               dear, Tony's dying to see you.

     In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, 
     is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They 
     all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around 
     hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.

                              TONY
               Yes, ladies, smiles, show me
               those smiles, fabulous, tropical
               smiles, think Tahiti, I want to
               see teeth, yes, those glorious
               teeth --

     As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place 
     simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

                              TONY (cont.)
               My God no, don't stop now, those
               smiles, I need those smiles --

     Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is 
     unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is 
     terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.

     The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH 
     SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.

                              TONY (cont.)
               Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
                     (beat)
               No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
               pull back!
                     (dropping the camera)
               OH MY GOD!

     The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering 
     convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN, 
     LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

     The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and
     DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead 
     SUPERMODELS.

                              PATSY
               The fashion world was stunned today
               by the sudden deaths of top models
               Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg.
               Cause of death has been attributed
               to a violent allergic reaction,
               although authorities have not yet
               ruled out the possibility of drug
               use. Dave?

     Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in 
     canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.

                              DAVE
               In Gotham, plans continue for the
               city's 300th birthday celebration.
               The four-day event will conclude
               with the unveiling, in Gotham
               Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady
               Gotham'... 

     A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               This bulletin just in. Nine more
               mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor
               in --

     Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               Patsy! This is hardly the --
                     (his eyes widen)
               PATSY!!

     An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat, 
     mouth agape in horror.

     PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY 
     RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS 
     UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

     TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy. 
     PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the 
     newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
     grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

     DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:

                              DAVE (cont.)
               KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --

     Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A 
     moment later, we're looking at:

     SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

     Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as 
     a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up 
     underneath.

                              MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)
               ... Love that Joker!

     INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

     THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- 
     THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The 
     shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK 
     HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.

     INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

     PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has 
     been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.

                              DIRECTOR
               WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

                              TECHNICIAN
               I DON'T KNOW!

     CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

                              JOKER
               ... new improved Joker brand. With
               the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL!
                     (a sweep of the hand)
               Let's go to our blind taste test.

     TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied 
     to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before 
     him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE 
     reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of
               sorts.
                     (wagging a finger)
               He's been using Brand X! But with
               new improved Joker brand... 

     ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his 
     chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!

     EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY

     THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before 
     him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH 
     DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               -- and the world smiles with you!
               Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --

     He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as 
     he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react 
     to the JOKER's maniacal promo.

                              JOKER
               I know what you're saying. Where can
               I buy these fine, fine products?
               Well, that's the gag, folks, you
               never know. Chances are... you've
               bought 'em already!!!

     As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:

     -    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for 
          a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under 
          one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can, 
          suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?

     -    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable 
          as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then 
          FREEZE with their forks in midair.

     -    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, 
          she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We 
          FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.

          On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE. 
          Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal 
          GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

     ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.

                              ALFRED
               ... Sir!

     HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT 
     begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.

                              JOKER
               Baby's got a tummyache? Here's
               something that'll fix him quick!

     He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering -- 
     he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Now on your grocer's shelf. So
               remember -- use Joker brand -- and
               put on a happy face!!

     MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed 
     transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.

                Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives
                WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?

     -    An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is 
          curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  ... sixteen new deaths, with no clues
                  as to the Joker's identity or
                  demands. The list at potentially
                  lethal products now includes:
                  perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --

     -    The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY 
          GUARDS rush to the scene as THREE MATRONLY CUSTOMERS
          go into simultaneous smiling fits.

     -    An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

                              ANCHORMAN
                  Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
                  -- underarm deodorant --

     -    A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF 
          SWEAT under every arm. The doors slide open; ONCOMING 
          PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.

     -    The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100% 
          natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing 
          altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly 
          visible.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --
                  moisturizing cream --

     -    A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers. 
          The store is utterly devoid of customers.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     From across the street we see VICKI headed down the 
     sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay 
     phone.

                              VOICE
               She's outside the Fluegelheim.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

     A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is 
     at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying 
     pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered 
     cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.

     In all the city, he's the only person still using 
     cosmetics.

     A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:

                              ALICIA
               Jack? Who was that?

     As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of 
     ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are 
     unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is 
     COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.

                              JOKER
               Get dressed. We're going out.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING

     A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something 
     Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open 
     atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along 
     the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You 
     walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING

     The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
     filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly 
     matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI 
     enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in 
     hand.

                              VICKI
               I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?

                              MAITRE D'
               No, but your table is ready.

     INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING

     VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A 
     WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, 
     bearing a single word: URGENT.

                              WAITER
               Miss Vale, this just arrived for
               you.

     As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is 
     a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

               DEAR V. VALE,
                    PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

     Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find 
     a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

     She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN 
     SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.

     TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART 
     LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

     VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. 
     Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

     INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT

     GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN 
     toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS 
     lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.

     The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open 
     and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
     street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.

     A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are 
     carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a 
     "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE 
     CANS OF BLACK PAINT.

     The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with 
     an appreciative eye.

                              JOKER
               Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.

     He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a 
     pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT 
     RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.

     He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, 
     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water 
     lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. 
     Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING 
     BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.

     He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I kinda like this one. Leave it.

     INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as 
     hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. 
     The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.

                              JOKER
               I think it's safe to take that off.

     VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes 
     the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're quite beautiful.

                              VICKI
               ... Thank you.

                              JOKER
               Unfortunate, but I think we can work
               around it.

     He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches 
     for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry 
     Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
               who I am. -- Is this your
               portfolio?

     She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of 
     VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
     Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. 
     Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... 
               Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.

     He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               The panic. The bloody skulls. The
               armless screaming fellows... you
               know, the atrocities.
                     (smirking)
               Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
               comes out so clean, so lovely.

     VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate 
     the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I guess I'm just an old cornball,
               but... I live for beauty. I look
               around at my little city, it gets me
               down.
                     (indicating the photos)
               We don't have anything like this.
               Well, it came to me that what this
               city needs... is beautification. Kind
               of a big makeover.
                     (enraptured)
               Miss Vale, I finally realized that
               one man can make a difference. You
               know the saying. "In his image... 
               created he them"?

     VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, 
     getting more frightened by the minute.

                              VICKI
               And you want a --

                              JOKER
               A visual record, yes. A before-and-
               after kind of thing.
                     (leaning closer)
               This could make your reputation.

     Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the 
     impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
     on film. She reaches for her camera bag.

                              VICKI
               Maybe we should start with a
               portrait of the artist. People might
               like to see the face behind the
               makeup.

                              JOKER
                     (momentarily puzzled)
               ... Behind the makeup?

     Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened 
     restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse 
     job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
     looking at his real face!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.

     He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very 
     carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- 
     suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
               you ANYWHERE!

     He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly 
     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.

     He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
     got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he 
     POINTS at the WATER GLASS:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Well? What are you waiting for??

     Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS 
     ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.

     His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked 
     Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to 
     wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.

     His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the 
     running makeup, he LEERS at her.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
               makeup.
                     (leaning forward)
               What do you think?

     VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.

                              VICKI
               I've seen worse. Much worse.

                              JOKER
               Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
               a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
               after all.

     He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's 
     coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind 
     them... and a VOICE intrudes:

                              VOICE
               Jack?

     The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and 
     moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing 
     the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

                              JOKER
                     (to VICKI)
               Christ, it's my girlfriend.
                     (to ALICIA)
               WHAT?

                              ALICIA
               You said I could look at the
               pictures before you -- before you --

                              JOKER
               Shucks, honey, I forgot.
                     (rolling his eyes at
                      VICKI)
               I'm in trouble now.
                     (to ALICIA)
               This is business, sweetie. Why don't
               you go outside and see how the boys
               are coming?

     VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting 
     eerily through the abandoned tea room.

                              VICKI
                     (hesitantly)
               ... Why the mask?

                              JOKER
               Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
               Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

     ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
               One in a million. A work of art. In 
               fact... 

     We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off. 
     The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the 
     side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               She makes you look sick.

     VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE 
     FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a 
     weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.

                              VICKI
               You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
               THAT to her!

                              JOKER
               What? I improved her a little... 

     VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE 
     BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.

                              VICKI
               I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
               -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!

                              JOKER
               Miss Vale, was it something I said?
                     (brightly)
               Do you want to sniff my flower?

     There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds 
     it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.

                              VICKI
               NO!

     The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID 
     spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

     She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from 
     the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.

                              JOKER
               Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
               THE ROSES!!

     He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --

     A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW 
     DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face 
     to face with... 

     THE BATMAN!

     On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER 
     like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM 
     THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --

     -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP 
     OUTSIDE!!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... YOU!!

     On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt. 
     In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT 
     OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR 
     STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!

     The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!

     His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp, 
     still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN 
     FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL

     He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it. 
     As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a 
     BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!

     TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up 
     short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI 
     drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.

     The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign 
     on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.

     VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.

     EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK

     VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET 
     into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

                              BATMAN
               GET IN THE CAR!

                              VICKI
               WHICH CAR?

     VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there 
     are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only 
     one BATMOBILE.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Oh.

     The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, 
     indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the 
     passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning 
     array of electronic gadgetry.

                              BATMAN
               Ignition!

     As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the 
     dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, 
     synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the 
     cockpit alongside VICKI.

     Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the 
     Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE 
     FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of 
     the alley at ninety miles an hour.

     THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.

                              JOKER
               I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!

     The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH 
     PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind 
     him, the other half into a second car nearby.

     EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

     SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.

                              VICKI
               Look! Police!

                              BATMAN
               I called them.

                              VICKI
               Shouldn't we --

     A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The 
     COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the 
     BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out 
     from the front of the van.

                              GOON
               There they are! Dead ahead!

     THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.

                              JOKER
               ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian 
     restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, 
     BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the 
     streets, eager to join the chase.

     SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS

     COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an 
     intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN 
     makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE 
     PAVEMENT.

                              VICKI
               What about her? What about the girl?

                              BATMAN
               He won't kill her.
                     (gritting his teeth)
               GODDAMMIT!

     They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION 
     TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and 
     inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.

     BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. 
     And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on 
     collision with a lamppost.

     He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE 
     JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

     ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a 
     crowd around them.

                              VICKI
               Can't we --

                              BATMAN
               Too many people. Come on!
                     (as she scrambles out)
               SHIELDS!!

     The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields.

     With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into 
     place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the 
     BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.

     BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, 
     vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.

     INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S 
     VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.

                              GOON AT WHEEL
               Are they ours?

                              JOKER
               ... I don't know. We'd better get out
               of here.
                     (into RADIO MIKE)
               Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??

     The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately 
     down the street.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, 
     dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.

     INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off 
     the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:

                              GOON I
               We got 'em!

                              JOKER (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Take 'em! I want his head!

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining 
     on them; and then, from behind --

     BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They 
     dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.

     They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.

     INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the 
     mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still 
     alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her 
     arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width 
     of the alleyway five stories up.

                              BATMAN
               How much do you weigh?

                              VICKI
               ... A hundred and eight?

     He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the 
     CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue 
     of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, 
     and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.

                              BATMAN
               HANG ON!

     The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches 
     on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL 
     on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.

     BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. 
     One story; two stories; and then... 

     They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's 
     goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward 
     another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.

     Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
     stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

     In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own 
     waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a 
     chance to protest, he LETS GO.

     VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the 
     way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

     VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the 
     line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row 
     of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per 
     limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam 
     two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --

     -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.

     BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off 
     and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.

     The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and 
     fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black 
     INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.

     They move closer. And stop.

                              GOON I
               ... No blood.

                              GOON II
               Jesus.

                              GOON III
               Wait a minute.

     GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the 
     body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.

                              GOON IV
               ... What is that?

                              GOON III
               Some kind of body armor.

                              GOON I
               He's human after all. -- Take that
               mask off.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

     Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the 
     roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as 
     the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this 
     height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a 
     sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.

     ANGLE ON GOONS

     peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE 
     WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.

                              GOON I
               Well?... Who is this guy?

                              GOON II
               I dunno. You seen him before?

                              GOON III
               Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.

                              GOON IV
               Good idea. Let's check his wallet.

                              GOON I
               We'll worry about it later. Plug
               him.
                        (beat)
               In the head.

     GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A 
     FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

     Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.

                              GOON III
               Goddam, it's the redhead!

     ON VICKI

     A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the 
     GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds 
     the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.

     ON BRUCE

     HIS EYES WINK OPEN.

     ON VICKI

     momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP 
     SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds 
     it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and 
     then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a 
     TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... 

     ON THE THUGS

     No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.

                              GOON II
               Did you hit her?

                              GOON I
               Who cares? Wax that freak.

     They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes 
     out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL 
     and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas 
     pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.

     In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body 
     THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage 
     can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.

     GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the 
     way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

     Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the 
     alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at 
     BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.

     BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

     Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised 
     on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH 
     GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.

     ON VICKI

     She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons 
     everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, 
     grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet 
     her.

     VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S 
     FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the 
     roll, then drops it down her blouse.

     But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens 
     her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the 
     alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.

     It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI 
     clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous 
     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.

     Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out 
     how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.

                              BATMAN
               ... Not even a 'thank you'?

                              VICKI
               Well -- I think you might consider
               thanking me. You were good as
               dead.

                              BATMAN
               That's because you lied about your
               weight.
                     (a long pause)
               Thank you.

     VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               I'll have to ask you for that film.

                              VICKI
               I just wanted to distract them. I
               wasn't trying to get a picture of
               you.

     BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The 
     telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.

                              BATMAN
               Please.

                              VICKI
               I won't let you have it.

     THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I know you can break my neck and
               take it. But the Joker's on that
               same roll. I --

                              BATMAN
               The Joker is a murderer. And you
               were as good as dead. So --

                              VICKI
               Look, I appreciate what you did for
               me. But this is my job. And I'm
               keeping those pictures.

                              BATMAN
               All right, here's a compromise. I'll
               develop the photos. You keep the
               Jokers and I'll keep the rest.

                              VICKI
               How do I know you won't keep them
               all?

                              BATMAN
               Because I'll take you with me.

     He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His 
     voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy 
     from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to 
     him.

     Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands 
     over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
     shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Thank you, Vicki.

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you going to take me?

     No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her 
     closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand 
     delicately along the line of her cheek... 

     ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS 
     into BATMAN's arms.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in 
     his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at 
     the BATMOBILE two blocks down.

     The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. 
     But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL 
     OVER the fearsome machine.

     BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON 
     CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the 
     Batmobile.

     He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
     from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.

                              BATMAN
               Shields open.

     EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

     TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From 
     within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields open.

     The steel plates begin to retract.

                              BATMAN (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Ignition.

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.

                              COP
               There's somebody in there!

     They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO 
     LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

     COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there 
     stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances 
     toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes 
     dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

     PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless 
     BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting, 
     dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of 
     COP CARS in hot pursuit.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and 
     approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms 
     and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING 
     HEADLIGHTS.

                              BATMAN
               STOP!

     BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN 
     and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.

     SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible 
     behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's 
     powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL 
     THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

     A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on 
     either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

     VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.

                              VICKI
               ... How long have I been out?

                              BATMAN
               Quite a while. I took the scenic
               route.

                              VICKI
                     (gazing around her)
               Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
               What's that?

     He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.

                              BATMAN
               Garage door.

     EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by 
     underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a 
     SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.

     Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds 
     later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.

     INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S 
     FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.

                              VICKI
               I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
               -- how did you know my name?

     BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I'm serious. How did you know?

     No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and 
     SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL 
     LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

     Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE 
     GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

     ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

     One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES 
     ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF 
     AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

     The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL 
     -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- 
     winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

     INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

     We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to 
     acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant 
     penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of 
     blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the 
     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.

     BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips 
     off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are 
     TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.

     VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and 
     picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to 
     examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.

                              VICKI
               What is this stuff? Kevlar?

                              BATMAN
               Better. It's not on the market yet.

                              VICKI
               It doesn't protect your head,
               though.

                              BATMAN
               That's why I wear a target on my
               chest.

     THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his 
     futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost 
     flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more 
     carefree, than some guys we could name... 

     ... like Bruce Wayne.

     VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping 
     at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.

                              VICKI
               How'd you find this place?

                              BATMAN
               Stumbled across it when I was a boy.

     VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses 
     overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               They don't come down here. They're
               afraid of the lights.

                              VICKI
               I don't like bats. Not that kind.

                              BATMAN
               They used to terrify me. But I
               forced myself to keep coming back,
               and --
                     (smiling)
               -- I guess I became the thing I
               feared the most. I'll do your photos
               now.

     He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the 
     kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the 
     roll.

     VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She 
     kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.

     She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair 
     of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.

                              VICKI
               Who pays for all this?

                              BATMAN
               I have sponsors.

                              VICKI
               The computers?

                              BATMAN
               I'm running a check on the tainted
               products. There is a pattern.
               Beauty products. Personal hygiene.

                              VICKI
               No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
               all be showing our true faces now.

     She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. 
     But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.

                              BATMAN
               I've tracked all the records. Every
               shipment, every warehouse, every
               loading dock. Nothing. No
               opportunities for tampering. Somehow
               the Joker is supplying tainted
               ingredients... at the source.

                              VICKI
               Wait. You can just tap into any
               corporate database you want?
               Anywhere?

                              BATMAN
               Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
               I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
               are ready.

     He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out 
     the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

                              VICKI
               You could've killed him, you know.
               You could have killed the Joker.

                              BATMAN
               I had to save you, Vicki.
                     (turning to face her)
               Here you go. I think I'll let you
               keep the whole set.

     She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four 
     shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but 
     there's no clean angle on his face.

     VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Care for an autograph?

     He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her 
     with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."

     Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is 
     trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto 
     roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind 
     him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.

                              VICKI
               ... Bruce?

     HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:

                              BATMAN
               Are you talking to me?

     He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a 
     SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw 
     on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Maybe we've had enough for one
               night. I'll take you home.

     Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the 
     BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his 
     utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Do you want to do it this time?

     VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as 
     he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Don't be afraid. I'm here.

     She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the 
     mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.

     FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
     burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW 
     fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

     The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: 
     liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless 
     cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays 
     underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters 
     emerge from the opening of a hit musical.

     In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, 
     his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son 
     BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, 
     head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.

     THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the 
     sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts 
     an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.

     IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES 
     are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and 
     MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle 
     BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF 
     JOY. And then, without warning --

     A HANDGUN enters frame.

     The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps 
     protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, 
     begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.

     MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at 
     her throat.

     The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But 
     MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.

     The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.

     The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The 
     pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward 
     the sidewalk.

     A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.

     THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek 
     we cannot hear --

     -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.

     BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a 
     handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's 
     purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the 
     boy.

     Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his 
     parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny 
     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around 
     them.

     He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the 
     GUNMAN turns and runs.

     AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
     winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics 
     with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped 
     tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.

     There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away 
     from us. We can't see his face.

     And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's 
     hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name, 
     LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in 
     GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.

     But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. 
     Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
     face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death... 
     and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
     violate this most private and terrible of moments.

     At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the 
     sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN 
     is smiling prettily at BRUCE.

     The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.

     A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding 
     white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING 
     SOUND cuts through the silence.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught. 
     The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her 
     hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.

     Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her 
     amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a 
     VOICE at the other end of the line.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki... ?

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT

     BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined 
     study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
                     (long pause)
               I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
               Are you there?

     INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI

                              VICKI
               Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

                              BRUCE
               I'm sorry about the way things went
               between us. I'd very much like to
               see you again.

                              VICKI
               Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
               would be possible.

                              BRUCE
               I wish you'd reconsider.
                     (groping)
               I didn't stand you up today. The
               museum was closed when I got there.

                              VICKI
               I, uh... 

     ON VICKI

     Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki? Vi --

     She returns the receiver to its cradle.

     ON BRUCE

     He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and 
     sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror. 
     She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

     Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into 
     the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe, 
     still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across 
     from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.

                              KNOX
               Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
               telling me -- the car, the equipment
               -- somebody's paying for it.

                              VICKI
               I just can't --

                              KNOX
               The FBI. You know who's got the FBI
               computer contract? Wayne
               Technologies.
                     (shaking his head)
               The guy's bats all right. He's bat
               shit crazy. This is gonna be the
               most incredible --

                              VICKI
               But he's not.

                              KNOX
               Not what?

                              VICKI
               He's not crazy.

     KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his 
     chair.

                              KNOX
               Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
               here... who dresses up like a bat. He
               goes out at night and swings around
               -- in his cape -- on a rope.
                     (throwing up his hands)
               Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.

                              VICKI
               Allie... he wants to tell me.
               That's why he took me there. Because
               he's trying to tell me.

                              KNOX
               Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
               he can talk to his car.

     The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in 
     utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her 
     loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               He has to tell someone. And I'm the
               one. He's trying to tell me.

     KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up 
     and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:

                              KNOX
               Well, when he does you know my
               number.

     EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the
     Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline:

                       WAR OF THE FREAKS
             Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout

     In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, 
     dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. 
     "WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-
     hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing 
     news:

             Product Scare Drops Dow to 1100
             Biggest One-Day Decline in History

     INT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY

     BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his 
     broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a 
     fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can 
     wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.

                              BRUCE
               Don't sell. It won't last. We'll
               ride it out.

     With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver 
     to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a 
     squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the 
     hook.

     INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is 
     shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. 
     The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.

                              WAILING COLLEAGUE
               ... a nine-million-dollar bath!

     BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the 
     door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank 
     of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to 
     make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a 
     number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:

                              BRUCE
                     (the familiar rasp)
               Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought
               I'd call and see how you're doing.

               going to talk to you unless we can
               discuss it.

               Who's this "Bruce"? Are you trying
               to make me jealous?

               Hi, Bruce.

     BRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His 
     face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE 
     still squeaking on the other end of the line.

               the next Gallup Poll.

                              REPORTER II
               Hey Knox, cheer up. It ain't the
               Batman but it's pretty choice.

     KNOX, who has recently taken up smoking, responds with a 
     grunt. SUDDEN HUBBUB from the ONLOOKERS as a wave of VIDEO 
     NOISE wipes half the screen away.

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     Split-screen. On one side is the MAYOR. On the other -- 
     sitting in a director's chair with a big yellow HAPPY-FACE 
     BACKDROP behind him -- is the JOKER, grinning fiendishly.

                              JOKER
               Joker here. Can we talk?

     The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.

                              MAYOR
               "While this administration remains
               vehemently opposed to terrorism in
               any form, we are prepared to
               negotiate any reasonable demands
               which will guarantee the safety of
               the populace."

                              JOKER
               Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is
               kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having
               such a swell time, I just haven't
               thought any up.

     He shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But I'm a reasonable fella. If you
               want to make me an offer... 

     Panicked, the MAYOR and co. go into a quick huddle.

                              MAYOR
               All right, all right. Here's the
               deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of
               ten million dollars, payable in --

                              JOKER
               Ten million dollars. Ten million
               dollars.
                     (flying off the handle)
               Ten mi-- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just
               wiped out the stock market. I've
               cost you billions!
                     (petulantly)
               I want ten million and one.

                              MAYOR
               No, wait, please! We'll talk. Just
               tell us what you expect.

                              JOKER
               Goddammit, I expect to be treated
               like an ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!

     MORE VIDEO STATIC sweeps across the screen, pushing the 
     MAYOR clean out of frame. The JOKER leers at the camera.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I might just think up some demands.
               And I'm gonna talk to all my
               friends, and see what they want,
               too. And then maybe we'll get
               together -- have a little party --
               exchange presents.
                     (waving goodbye)
               Happy Birthday, Gotham.

     "The Shadow of Your Smile" comes up UNDERNEATH as the 
     JOKER's transmission ends and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

     INT. GLOBE CITY ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     FRANTIC ACTIVITY as REPORTERS rush to their telephones and
     typewriters. KNOX strolls slowly back to his desk. He's 
     sitting on the biggest story of his career... and now, as 
     he realizes grimly, nobody knows or cares.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - DAY

     A tiny island in Gotham Harbor, homesite of LADY GOTHAM -- 
     the huge, newly restored stone statue that welcomes 
     incoming ships. Her upper half is draped in a huge TARP 
     prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this Sunday.

     At the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big 
     wooden platform, complete with microphones, amplifiers and 
     spotlights. They raise a gigantic BANNER which reads: 
     "GOTHAM CITY -- 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION."

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A TAXI pulls away from the wrought-iron gate at the 
     entrance to the estate. KNOX ambles up to a stone pillar, 
     glances up at a VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the gate, and 
     hits a BUZZER.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
                     (through loudspeaker)
               Yes?

                              KNOX
               Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               Mr. Wayne is out for the day.

                              KNOX
               Actually, I wanted to talk to
               Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne,
               would you?

     KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. 
     Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY

     KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big 
     leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him.

                              BRUCE
               I've been expecting to hear from
               you.

                              KNOX
               Well, that's how it is, chum. She
               tells me everything.

                              BRUCE
               What is it you want?

                              KNOX
               Simple. You know the score. One
               column -- and I can bring all this
               tumbling down. I can take you off
               the streets once and for all.
                        (a shaky pause)
               I want you to hang up the suit. And
               I want you to stay away from Vicki.

                              BRUCE
               I can't do that. Not while the
               Joker's still out there.

                              KNOX
               Then stay away from Vicki. That's
               all I want, man. I just want your
               word.

     BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his 
     jacket for a cigarette.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               See, I don't know how it happened --
               she's a smart girl and you are an
               extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but
               she's in love with you.

                              BRUCE
               There's something I don't
               understand. If you've got the story,
               why haven't you printed it?

                              KNOX
               Because I --
                     (beat)
               Because she'd never speak to me
               again.

     KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs 
     out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
               have you got to offer? You gonna
               marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
                     (laughing bitterly)
               Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be
               Best Rodent?

     BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even 
     put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking 
     at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.

                              BRUCE
               Do you want a drink?

                              KNOX
               Yeah, a drink. "Civilized."  Man-to-
               man, right?

                              BRUCE
               Alfred, bring something for Mr.
               Knox. -- I'll have one too.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

     The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and 
     Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE 
     CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in 
     everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, 
     representing the King in progressive stages of 
     deterioration.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK

     She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               ... So we just pretend none of this
               ever happened. We never met. We --
                     (frightened)
               You're going to get yourself killed,
               Bruce. You know that, don't you?

                              BRUCE
               It wouldn't matter much.

                              VICKI
               I don't understand it. You can do so
               much good for people. As Bruce
               Wayne.

     He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the 
     same argument with himself a thousand times.

                              BRUCE
               Money makes money, Vicki. The
               foundation runs itself. -- I'm
               extraneous to the process.

                              VICKI
               You're one man. You can't save
               everybody.

                              BRUCE
               What it I could save a handful?
               -- What if I could save one?

     VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands 
     up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:

                              VICKI
               Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
               can't even save yourself.

                              BRUCE
                     (staring right at her)
               Sometimes... I don't know if there's
               enough of me left to save.

     VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               Oh, God. I've got to have some
               coffee or something.

     A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. 
     Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.

     VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on 
     his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.

                              BRUCE
               Are you expecting anyone?

     She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Who's there?

     THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.

                              DELIVERY BOY
               Package tor Miss Vale.

                              BRUCE
               Set it down by the door. On the
               left-hand side.

     The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, 
     tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a 
     moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick 
     up the mysterious package.

     Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!

     He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets 
     it down on the kitchen counter.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               It's just like the last time. He
               sent me a present before he --

                              BRUCE
               Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

     As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds 
     his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a 
     LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then 
     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
               it around with you.

                              BRUCE
               I feel naked without it.

     He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a 
     stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the 
     earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
               Wait in the next room.

     He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then 
     SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.

     Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is 
     full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into 
     the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.

     In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.

     BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the 
     counter.

                              BRUCE
               ... They're wax.

     VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.

                              VICKI
               "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make
               up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.

                              BRUCE
                     (lost in thought)
               That does it. It's going to be this
               weekend.

     The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. 
     Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.

                              ALICIA
               I thought you ought to know -- he's
               coming for you... 

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the 
     mouthpiece with one hand.

                              BRUCE
               Keep her on the line!

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you calling from?

     As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE 
     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP 
     COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up 
     a telecommunications program.

     A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --

                              BRUCE
               Finding out where she is.

                              VICKI
               How can you do that if she's already
               off the line?

                              BRUCE
               I've had an automatic tracer on this
               number ever since he tracked you to
               the museum.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

     MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding, 
     INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name -- 
     ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.

                              BRUCE
               Got it!

                              VICKI
               What now!

                              BRUCE
               Hang on. I have to leave a message.

     HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key 
     to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on 
     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.

     The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the 
     elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas. 
     The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall 
     and march toward VICKI's apartment.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

     BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing 
     dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the 
     DOOR unlocking behind her.

     She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.

                              THUG I
               Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
               fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
               to --

     BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single 
     sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS 
     at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the 
     shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick 
     succession.

                              BRUCE
               There's a garage in this building?

     VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his 
     element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.

     She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK 
     NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is 
     full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I've got to take him out now.

     He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key 
     off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Pick an apartment and stay there.
               And listen: call the police. Give
               them that address. Every available
               man.

     He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a 
     dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.

     INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO 
     ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the 
     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.

     BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the 
     thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van, 
     his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING 
     DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.

     He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels 
     around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
     forgotten something.

                              BRUCE
               Oh, hell!

     The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the 
     elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that 
     something is amiss.

                              GOON
               Hey, boss, something's up. The
               elevator's working.

     INT. VAN - ON JOKER

     Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.

                              JOKER
               DAMMIT! You can't get good help
               these days. -- Let's move out.

     EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling 
     out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE. 
     He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL 
     LIGHT begins to flash.

     BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the 
     BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's 
     BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.

     EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual. 
     But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky, 
     staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.

     Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow 
     belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the 
     intersection on a ROPE.

     INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER

     The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on 
     either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:

                              JOKER
               Slow down, you maniac!

     EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. 
     His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just 
     about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING 
     MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands 
     directly behind him on the horse's back.

     BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. 
     The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through 
     the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, 
     UNMARKED CARS are converging.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They 
     see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.

                              DRIVER
               Boss! Jesus! They've --

                              JOKER
               They'll be sorry. They'll be
               sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, 
     drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the 
     FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.

     EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

     INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

     We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat 
     beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the 
     city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect 
     sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

     BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING 
     TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its 
     hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --

     -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, 
     neatly tied in string.

     BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick 
     salute -- and the BUG is gone.

     INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING

     The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the 
     southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are 
     everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for 
     the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.

                              JOKER
               MOVE! Can't you do something??

                              DRIVER
               It's some kind of detour. They're
               backed up for blocks!

     The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view 
     mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.

                              JOKER
               Oh my God. How does he do it... ?

     EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT

     THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET 
     ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around 
     the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, 
     RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first 
     opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO 
     GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.

     BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on 
     the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from 
     overhead.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING

     CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the 
     FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:

                              EMCEE
               -- the most spectacular, most death-
               defying aerial stunt ever devised.
               Tonight -- for the first time
               anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!

     He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying 
     side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the 
     twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING 
     GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled 
     red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other 
     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL

     PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the 
     crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.

     On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He 
     lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly 
     against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- 
     driving it off the access road down into the brush, where 
     it nearly topples over sideways.

     ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS

     GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, 
     landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're 
     swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make 
     the return leap back to his own trapeze.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, 
     compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, 
     he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's 
     got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.

                              PILOT
               Ready to go, Dick?

                              DICK
               What's all the ruckus down there?

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding 
     trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its 
     side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER - 
     FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."

     The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.

                              JOKER
               Head for the truck!

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the 
     JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back 
     of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER

     THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a 
     massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of 
     BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!

     THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an 
     expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.

                              JOKER
               I love fireworks!

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past. 
     One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON 
     falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER 
     plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.

     MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and 
     weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a 
     wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER 
     veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously 
     close to the tall buildings along the avenue.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a 
     canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings 
     into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.

                              DICK
               NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!

     His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT 
     struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding 
     a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before 
     THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED 
     OUT OF THE COPTER.

     ANGLE ON DICK

     With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A 
     FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a 
     nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down. 
     And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --

     -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended 
     target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun 
     and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the 
     chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF 
     A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.

     ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists 
     his chrome spear over the windshield.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT 
     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES 
     CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up 
     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads 
     "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken 
     off!

     ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across 
     the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over 
     a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet, 
     ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm 
     around his waist.

                              DICK
               LET ME GO! LET ME --

     THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with 
     MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the 
     GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.

                              DICK (cont.)
               YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--

     DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his 
     hands full restraining the kid.

                              JOKER
               Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
               hot.
                     (glowering at BATMAN)
               Hands off the belt.

                              BATMAN
               Take me. Let the boy go.

                              JOKER
               Gosh, I could kill you, but then
               you'd miss my party. And I'd be
               real, real sad if you couldn't make
               it.

                              BATMAN
               What are you talking about?

                              JOKER
               Batman! Don't you even recognize
               your old pal Jack? After all... 
                     (cackling insanely)
               You made me what I am today.

     BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS 
     BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the 
     crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the 
     night.

     DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to 
     the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.

                              DICK
               HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
               MY --

     BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into 
     his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE 
     under DICK's nose.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. 
     COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.

                              REPORTER
               ... on a tip attributed to the
               mysterious Batman. The apartment was
               booby-trapped with the Joker's
               laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
               dead.
                     (beat)
               Also found dead at the scene was
               Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --

     CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of 
     BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other 
     screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.

     We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, 
     showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER 
     and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate 
     transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads 
     into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, 
     as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
     Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.

     Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
     flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE 
     CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.

     And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head 
     in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
     responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
     he would just as soon be dead.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, 
     unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.

     Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his 
     unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.

                              DICK
               ... Where am I?

                              BRUCE
               My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
               welcome to stay here as long as you
               want.

     BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast 
     tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on 
     here?

     INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT 
     march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.

                              DENT
               We'll send a team into Ace the
               moment the warrant comes through.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be ready when you do. Remember
               what happened at the apartment.

                              DENT
               All right, Bruce, what do you
               suggest?

                              BRUCE
               I suggest a nice big bomb.

                              DENT
               Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
               Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.

                              BRUCE
               Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
               the anniversary celebration.

                              DENT
               We've told him we'll deal. What
               could he possibly have to gain by --

                              BRUCE
               Do you still think the Joker cares
               about money??

                              DENT
               I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
               don't have access to all your
               expert sources.

     Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back 
     a moment, then turns down the hall.

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long 
     driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED 
     INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, 
     then climbs out and towels himself off.

     He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable 
     in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could 
     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray 
     bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and 
     tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's 
     costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway 
     behind him.

                              DICK
               ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
               so I figured I'd hoof it.

                              BRUCE
               Sorry. I can't let you leave.

                              DICK
               You can't keep me here, man. That's
               kidnapping.

                              BRUCE
               If I let you leave, you'll do the
               same thing again. You'll go after
               the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
                     (turning to go)

                              DICK
               Hey, man. Look at you. You're
               rich. You got everything you want.
               How do you know what's in my mind?

     BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are 
     filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.

                              BRUCE
               I don't care what's in your mind.
               You're staying.

     BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the 
     kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding 
     speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up 
     spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.

     DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a 
     move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.

     A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with 
     a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of 
     motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's 
     chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up 
     curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle 
     royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. 
     He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. 
     Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... 
     who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.

     A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:

                              DICK
               ... You're him.

     No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly... 

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               FREEZE!

     DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler 
     stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance, 
     a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.

                              BRUCE
               It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
               under control.

                              ALFRED
               ... Very good, sir.

     ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

     CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift 
     STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.

                              JOKER
               Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
               I'm here to tell you... we have had
               one helluva quarter.

     He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable 
     easels.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
               fear's gone straight through the
               roof. You guys should be proud --
               'cause I couldn'ta done it without
               each and every one of you!

     MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I feel it's time to expand the
               Joker line. I was askin' myself,
               what are the products that every
               consumer wants most? And that's when
               it hit me: the water you drink, and
               the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
                     (strutting across stage)
               Now, some of you have your eye on
               the profit margin. You're thinkin':
               this boy's too ambitious. You
               don't approve. In fact, some of you
               have been talking about turning me
               in to the cops. Or knocking me off.

     He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But that's okay. I understand. Not
               everyone shares my eye for beauty.
               And just to show there's no hard
               feelings, I'm throwin' a little
               shindig tonight -- and you're all
               invited!

     THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the 
     Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins, 
     no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
     living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling 
     corpses.

     One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.

                              JOKER
               Look at that, folks. We got 'em
               rolling in the aisles!

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK

     VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on 
     the pillows. BRUCE is in his robe over by the window, 
     looking out at his estate.

                              BRUCE
               All this apparatus, Vicki... this
               house, and the money, and the
               power... it was never mine. It was
               something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
               was something I inherited.
                     (pause)
               All I ever hoped for was someone who
               could see through Bruce -- who could
               see me -- and not be frightened.

                              VICKI
               I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
               I'm frightened for you.

                              BRUCE
               In all these years... why couldn't I
               see how it would turn out?

     He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now 
     she's truly afraid.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
               for me, there'd be no Joker.

     INT. BATCAVE - EVENING

     TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel 
     casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER. 
     BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver, 
     hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30. 
     29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
     countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his 
     utility belt.

     He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape 
     and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the 
     shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.

                              BRUCE
               Where's the boy?

                              ALFRED
               Upstairs. He's quite docile.

                              BRUCE
               I know that feeling. It won't last.

     BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks 
     on tremulously.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               He's a long way ahead of where I was
               at his age.
                     (taking ALFRED's
                      shoulders)
               I want you to treat him just as if
               he were me. Promise.

                              ALFRED
               Yes, sir.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be taken care of financially.
               Beyond that... you know what to do.
               Don't let all this go to waste.

     Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to 
     speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long 
     circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne 
     Manor. On the third step he pauses:

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Alfred? -- Thank you.

     As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies 
     himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

     BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current 
     time is 7:09 PM.

     He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, 
     and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep, 
     regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later, 
     BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.

     Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.

     At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing 
     closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME, 
     twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of 
     R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.

     HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the 
     clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with 
     its grating electronic WHINE.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

     The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage 
     point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out 
     the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up 
     the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights 
     off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's 
     forces.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge 
     shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with 
     a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot 
     outside.

                              DISPATCHER
               Boston, Philly: loading bay one.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR 
     and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and 
     taking half the chain-link fence with it.

     In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the 
     BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A 
     ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the 
     factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole 
     in the door.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and 
     SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are 
     everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and 
     PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

     CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass 
     dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and 
     COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It 
     doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving.

     TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny 
     voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:

                              COMPUTER
               ... Detonate.

     A beat. Then: BLAM.

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing 
     to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS 
     dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.

     All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.

                              COP
                    Good Lord!

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking 
     lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. 
     For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

     All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble 
     and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT

     DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham 
     Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming 
     stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, 
     ready to be unveiled.

     THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of 
     Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
     talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the 
     Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as 
     the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's 
     just another part of the celebration.

     At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a 
     microphone:

                              GOVERNOR GILROY
               As Governor of this great state, it
               is now my honor to unveil for you a
               very special lady -- a lady who
               stands tall for life and liberty --
               America's favorite lady... LADY
               GOTHAM!

     The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY 
     GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's 
     Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair 
     of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: 
     hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the 
     canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... 

     ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
     WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!

     Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE 
     SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS 
     ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: 
     the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the 
     stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD 
     stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.

     And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS 
     GOING DARK.

     EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT

     QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different 
     points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a 
     PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:

                              JOKER (V.O.)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
               little token of my esteem. HAVE
               FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!

     INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S 
     HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to 
     earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS 
     try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another 
     in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT 
     DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb 
     out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.

     DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED 
     COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, 
     DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled 
     subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.

     On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a 
     field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless 
     against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.

     FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats 
     and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of 
     an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... 
     only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a 
     SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild 
     street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
     her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.

                              KNOX
               VICKI!

     VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's 
     wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
               girl could get hurt this way.

                              VICKI
               Yeah. Deja vu.

                              KNOX
               What do you say? Let's head for the
               lights.

     In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS 
     are sweeping the sky.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
     huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
     portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.

     On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the 
     street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if 
     nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block  
     intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS 
     BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical 
     figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.

     The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN -- 
     smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We 
     TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT... 

     ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
     queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily 
     at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like 
     some demented parade marshal.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints 
     on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the 
     legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."

     Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT

     The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously 
     TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A 
     STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.

     THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift, 
     sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS 
     EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to 
     release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER

     The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the 
     reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and 
     wonder what to do next.

     They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a 
     sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they 
     HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE 
     TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and 
     destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN

     in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the 
     wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham 
     skyline.

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT

     FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE 
     FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.

     Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character 
     UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on 
     itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the 
     street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts 
     downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon 
     blimp EXPLODES.

                              KNOX
               So much for Underdog.

     THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all 
     at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK 
     SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to 
     engulf the entire block!

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

                              KNOX
               WHAT HAPPENED?!?

     VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up 
     the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!

                              VICKI
               Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
               got the balloons rigged with
               compressor tanks!!

                              KNOX
               Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets. 
     He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES. 
     At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling 
     to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT 
     streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.

                              VICKI
               LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
                     (frantically)
               Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
               find some way to tell him!

                              KNOX
               Great. How??

     They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS 
     SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES 
     and SKIDS TO A HALT.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               COME ON!

     EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT

     Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from 
     the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He 
     flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.

     It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in 
     party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that 
     current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.

     As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy 
     out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And 
     DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.

     Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT 
     TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.

                              KNOX
               GIMME A HAND UP HERE!

     VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of 
     the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel 
     assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... 

     ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its 
     massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in 
     the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.

     BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.

     EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing 
     MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on 
     the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE 
     CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.

     He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints 
     bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed 
     inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is 
     BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... 

     ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! 
     The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE 
     TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring 
     through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to 
     the ground!

                              JOKER
               No... NOOOOO!!!

     ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON

     as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in 
     the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it 
     now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it 
     disperses harmlessly in the wind.

     EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the 
     rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds 
     it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; 
     hits a button repeatedly... 

     ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The 
     damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
     fit of pique.

     A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back 
     for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of 
     twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.

     CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS 
     sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on 
     helplessly, in stunned disbelief.

     As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON 
     THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.

                              JOKER
               There. There. -- GET 'EM!!

     ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK

     A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX 
     throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the 
     spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.

                              KNOX
               GET THE CAR!

     The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the 
     Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps 
     off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of 
     rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.

     GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.

     INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

     KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL 
     LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally 
     exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.

                              KNOX
               HOLY SHIT!!

                              VICKI
               You okay?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
               SEE THAT?!

                              VICKI
                     (laughing wildly)
               God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
               that was the ballsiest move I
               ever --

                              KNOX
                     (ecstatic)
               Holy shit. Holy --

     He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between 
     his lips -- and BURSTS.

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!!

     His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He 
     looks down in genuine bewilderment.

                              KNOX
               Jesus, Vicki.

     That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and 
     slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the 
     street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

     EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

     In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, 
     past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the 
     one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear 
     through a CONCEALED HATCH.

     WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE 
     mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the 
     parade decorations. And one moment later... 

     A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a 
     burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, 
     leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops 
     low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he 
     streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
     SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The 
     JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
     him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips 
     through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and 
     BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN 
     stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's 
     clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.

     He's coming back for more!

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.

                              JOKER
               He'll be back... he'll be back!!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING

     The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full 
     speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either 
     side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The 
     REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO 
     FLAME!

     The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the 
     tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps 
     the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF 
     THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of 
     the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.

     And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as 
     the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE 
     OPEN!

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in 
     the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS 
     groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and 
     the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE 
     SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A 
     hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and 
     pulls himself up to the street.

     He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the 
     BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt 
     SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the 
     tunnel.

                              JOKER
               You do him. I'm outta here.

     The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They 
     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the 
     Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN... 
     inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.

     A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for 
     their guns, move in warily... 

                              VOICE
               Yo.

     The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of 
     motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and 
     green --

     -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only 
     one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a 
     red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS 
     and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot 
     or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the 
     plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.

     TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in 
     place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
     like haze, A HAND extended toward him:

                              DICK
               HEY! COME ON!

     And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming 
     wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an 
     extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in 
     agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath 
     him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.

                              DICK
               Now we're even, huh? Even up.

                              BATMAN
               How did you... 

                              DICK
               I hitched. MOVE IT!

     DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO 
     FLAME behind them.

                              BATMAN
               The Joker. Is he --?

                              DICK
               Forget it. Relax.
                     (beat)
               ... He's mine now.

     DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.

                              BATMAN
               DICK!

     THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is 
     unendurable. His body has finally failed him.

     He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as 
     DICK races off with murder in his eyes.

     EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky, 
     piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is 
     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old 
     abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.

                              JOKER
               Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.

     HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER 
     forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, 
     hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
     glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all 
     forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders 
     about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.

     DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear 
     pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS 
     at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS 
     DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.

     In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER 
     finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden 
     stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and 
     starts up.

     DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back 
     of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor, 
     unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA 
     WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.

     Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED 
     BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center 
     aisle of the old cathedral.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

     A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the 
     wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.

     The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on 
     the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:

                              JOKER
               I'm in the belltower. Don't land.

     INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT

     A PILOT replies through his radio headset.

                              PILOT
               E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.

     The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.

     INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls 
     himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
     Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.

     Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps 
     against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his 
     utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule 
     back onto his dry, swollen tongue.

     Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and 
     TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten 
     wood of the belltower stairs.

     THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. 
     And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN 
     MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.

     It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the 
     fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, 
     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.

     Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. 
     His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN 
     INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.

     For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED 
     WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, 
     trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last 
     ounce of strength.

     The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. 
     BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.

     He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility 
     belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making 
     earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at 
     his side.

     THE BATMAN is out like a light.

     INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering 
     what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves 
     cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... 
     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.

                              JOKER
               ... Batman?

     No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little 
     snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of 
     his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on 
     his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS 
     BATMAN up into the belltower.

     He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. 
     The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- 
     pats his face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Batman? Batman?

     THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I thought you'd be more comfortable
               here in the belfry.
                     (chuckling to himself)
               Before I kill you I'd like to see
               who you are. Would that be okay?

     BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes 
     and reaches over to undo his cowl.

     BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The 
     JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, 
     moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh my, aren't we pretty.
                     (brightening suddenly)
               I know you! You're the rich boy!!

     The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps 
     his hands together in sheer glee.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               My goodness, what in the world made
               you do it? It must've been
               something pretty terrible!

     He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You know, we should've sat down and
               had us a little heart-to-heart. I
               bet we would have got on famously.

                              BATMAN
               Mad... man... 

                              JOKER
               Well now, you're not exactly the
               picture of mental health, are you.

                              BATMAN
               ... Murderer... 

                              JOKER
               Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
               how many people you've killed by
               letting me live.

     A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his 
     helicopter approaching in the distance.

     BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his 
     utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.

     The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens 
     it gingerly.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
               won't even hurt. Now relax. The
               bat's in his belfry, all's right
               with the world... 

     He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE 
     reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER 
     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Why, Bruce... 

     Then he hears ticking.

     Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 
     0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.

     He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.

     BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch 
     convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

     BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!

                              BRUCE
               No... sense... of humor?

     The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks 
     better of it and retracts his shaking hand.

     He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the 
     clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his 
     signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.

     The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on 
     the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down 
     the stairs in a frenzy.

     There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and 
     counting.

     Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and 
     makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly 
     overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.

     EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT

     The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a 
     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD 
     LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost 
     losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures 
     wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.

     EXT. BELLTOWER

     A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves 
     -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of 
     the old cathedral --

     -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air 
     like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
     blind uncomprehending fury --

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, 
     cackles in mad triumph --

     -- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING 
     SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE 
     ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER --

     -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

     -- and plunges into the night.

     TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if 
     he makes his choice now.

     Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body 
     working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches 
     into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.

     It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.

     INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT

     The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just 
     enough to see what's going on.

                              CO-PILOT
               PULL UP!! PULL --

     EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly 
     silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies 
     splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the 
     churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in 
     the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE 
     FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.

     Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. 
     Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.

     POV JOKER

     Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, 
     bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the 
     sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE

     It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost 
     childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, 
     though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins 
     to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness 
     sets in.

                                               FADE THROUGH TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               As the details of the Joker's
               heinous plan become known, a city's
               gratitude goes out to the mysterious
               Batman. His whereabouts remain
               unknown, but Batman -- if you're
               alive -- if you're listening --
               thank you.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT 
     in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine 
     it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping 
     flowers.

                              VICKI
               I loved you too.

     As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she 
     gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.

     The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY

     ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.

                              ALFRED
               No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm
               afraid he's quite unreachable.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized 
     SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.

     In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. 
     Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping 
     him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.

                              VICKI
               I don't know why I'm doing this. I
               half wish you'd stay a cripple.

                              BRUCE
               Ohhhh... you don't mean that.

                              VICKI
                     (grasping for words)
               I don't, but... I do. It's just... I
               love you, Bruce. I --

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or
               all of me?

     A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for 
     several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.

                              VICKI
               I guess you did it, didn't you. You
               saved everyone.
                     (pause)
               Almost.

     For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls 
     her over, takes her in a tight embrace.

                              BRUCE
               I don't know how to explain this so
               it makes sense... but you saved
               me.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and 
     looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets 
     his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation -- 
     LEAPS INTO THE VOID.

     His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE 
     AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the 
     rings on his way down.

     Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the 
     pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOFTOP - GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

     A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the 
     distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling 
     finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at 
     the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.

     A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his 
     RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN 
     SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through 
     the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a 
     BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.

     We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN 
     vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new 
     adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

     It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
     uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has
     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation
     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as
     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
     "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
     Christmas."

     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
     wants more.

     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
     BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this
     winter, Batmania is everywhere...

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,
     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
     the few passersby.

     They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent
     Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides
     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
     of year.

     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

     EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows
     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
     into a drift.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give
     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
     Salvation Army SANTA...

     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The
     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
     burdened with LOOT.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid
     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of
     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

     EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple
     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,
     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are
     obviously going to get away clean -- unless...

     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes
     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

                               COP
               What the hell -- ?

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the
     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's
     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A
     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio
     mike:

                               COP WITH MIKE
               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!
                    (pause)
               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the
     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
     stopping...

     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second
     later...

     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS
     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of
     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

                               COP I
               ...That was Batman.

                               COP II
               NO SHIT!!

     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
     a path, they might as well join in the chase...

     EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
     horizon...

     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they
     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the
     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

     EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES
     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the
     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
     COPS race past him on foot.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up
     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
     left and right...

     ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
     disappear.

     ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
     hill...

     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

     ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
     explodes harmlessly.

     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
     ITSELF into a distant TREE.

     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
     heels into a drift.

     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

     EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They
     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
     disappear over a crest of a hill...

     EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
     of the lake.

     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
     sliding forward.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

     EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on
     the dashboard...

     EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost
     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
     know what's hit them.

     ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of
     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
     clearing...

     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
     to build up speed.

     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
     the Batmobile rises half a foot --

     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
     tracks.

     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
     almost atop him --

     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
     frame.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up
     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a
     dull ROAR in the distance...

     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
     colleague and SHRUGS:

                               COP I
               ...Merry Christmas.

     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

                               COP II
               Gift-wrapped and everything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER
     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

                               GORDON
               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
               in precious jewels were recovered intact
               by the police force -- working in concert
               with Batman.

     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
     crowd:

                               VOICES IN CROWD
               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE
               STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

     GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group
     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're
     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
     saw in the park.

     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
     over the din.

                               GORDON
               I would like to stress -- that while this
               city enjoys a special relationship with
               Batman --
                    (louder)
               -- we do not condone vigilantism --
                    (practically screaming)
               -- IN ANY FORM.

     It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
     continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he
     returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
     huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
     Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
     RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
     BAT."

                               SEKOWSKY
               And hey!  Where does this --
                    (BLEEP; expletive deleted)
               -- Gordon get off calling us ?
               We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a
               group of concerned citizens, that's all --
               just like Batman.

 WOMAN IN CROWD                You people are nothing but hoodlums!

 SEKOWSKY                Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
               riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
               like you.
                    (into mike)
               If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --

     MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a
     minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
     breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
     screen, placing us in:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
     with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of
     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
     the mike...

                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)
               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
               alive in this city.  We're gonna take back
               the streets!

     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
     chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
     flicks it off.

     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
     "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
     Sterling silver tea service.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
     side drawer.

     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."  ALFRED digs
     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
     the rear of the drawer.

     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

     INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
     "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
     wrapped in a tarp.

     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
 BRUCE. 
 ALFRED                Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
 A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. 
 BRUCE                I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly
     regains his composure:

 ALFRED                I took the liberty of preparing tea.
                    (indicating tbe monitors)
               I take it you've been watching the news?

     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
     and nods.

 BRUCE                Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off
     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops
     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

 ALFRED                I should inform you...Christmas is
               approaching, and we've received our annual
               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
                    (eyeing the equipment)
               If I may inquire...?

 BRUCE                Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
     like the skeleton of an umbrella.

 ALFRED                Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly it? BRUCE What does it look like? ALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. BRUCE Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right. BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. ALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... BRUCE We can do better than that. ALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on, concerned: ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir? BRUCE Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki. ALFRED (anxiously) Miss Vale, sir...? BRUCE Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas. BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED heaves an audible sigh of relief as we CUT TO: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS with quick, birdlike strokes. MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars -- and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door... GUARD Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy? MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname. GUARD (cont.) Boniface... MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out. INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD. PAROLE OFFICER You want to return the money you stole. BONIFACE Intact. The map will show you where it's buried. The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP. PAROLE OFFICER All of it. Forty-two million dollars. MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear. PAROLE OFFICER II Why this sudden change of heart? MR. BONIFACE Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full. I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people. PAROLE OFFICER II Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars?? MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type... WARDEN His record's clean. Thirteen years without an incident. ATTORNEY I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals... The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg. MR. BONIFACE Birds, yes. My only source of solace. PAROLE OFFICER In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole. BONIFACE Thank you, sir. You won't regret it. MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office: MYNAH CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES NOT PAY. CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board: ATTORNEY Personally trained by my client. INT. PRISON CELL - DAY Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE: MR. BONIFACE -- Where are my birds?!? T-BONE Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go. MR. BONIFACE Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of winter! T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR. BONIFACE's profound distress. T-BONE They were all cooped up. With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do. BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile... MR. BONIFACE I see. -- You might as well have this. I won't be needing it... He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the earphones... T-BONE Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours. T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: MR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and "business managers." FRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. PENGUIN Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning are about to pay off. INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. PENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? FRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. $42,271,009... PENGUIN How much have we got left? FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. FRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- PENGUIN Fine, fine. How much? FRICK Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the sum we buried. THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. PENGUIN Speaking of burials... EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the headphones... The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. T-BONE HEY -- ! He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird bird, bird is the word... EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. VICKI Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present for Bruce. She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... VICKI (cont.) Skis. -- Don't let on, okay? ALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. VICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for. -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? ALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree... VICKI Not so fast. She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. ALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! VOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI waves frantically. VICKI Don't look. It's your present. VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny box -- BRUCE What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against him. WHISPERS in his ear: VICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly, huddling against the cold. An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens, half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME." The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw Construction, Inc. A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby... INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the demonstration. VICKI Homeless. (beat) I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like there's more every day. BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to say. VICKI (cont.) Christmas time. And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park already. BRUCE -- Yeah. The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park. EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as BRUCE'S CAR pulls up. A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience -- as they enter. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park. VICKI They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown. These people don't have anyplace else to go. (beat) If the city starts selling off the park... BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings. HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance... BRUCE -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert. VICKI (taking his hand) Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of. BRUCE Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes -- VICKI That's not what I meant. They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with BRUCE. BRUCE -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. (long pause) I'm just a Band-Aid. VOICE FROM BEHIND Bruce! It's been ages! VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder. Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE. BRUCE Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's the construction business? SHAW The park tower? All systems go. If we can get the junkies and winos cleared out... (a big grin) Not too late to get in on the deal. BRUCE I'll think about it. SHAW Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe. We should all get together at the club. (clapping him on the shoulder) Nice to see you again, Miss Veal. "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth: VICKI What a pig. BRUCE I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too. VICKI Now he wants to gobble up the park... (shivering) Bruce -- isn't there something you can do about people like that? BRUCE What, tie him up with a bat-rope? VICKI No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce. BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the lot outside... The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS, in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS. BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a little closer -- within eavesdropping range: RED BERET I We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing. JOGGER I was attacked. Three men in ski masks -- COP I (indicating the RED BERETS) And these two broke it up? JOGGER These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never saw anybody take off so -- RED BERET II Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops. COP II You. SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? JOGGER A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: RED BERET I Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you. It's fulla bums. BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. BRUCE Nice outfit. RED BERET I Piss off, geek. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: ANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: RICKY Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps? In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back. RICKY (cont.) Midnight. No sweat. See you then. He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. SELINA Well. "Ricky," is it? RICKY How'd you know that? SELINA I heard you on the phone. Talking to your girlfriend. RICKY Girlfriend? No, no. That was business. SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. SELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. RICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. SELINA Why wouldn't they be? RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare. RICKY You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. SELINA Oh, they're real, all right. So are these. She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood. RICKY is hypnotized. She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. CUT TO: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major is about to happen... The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to a colleague: DOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? DOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid. And here we are freezin' our balls off... EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck. BOAT THUG I You pick. The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM -- revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER. POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the merchandise. LIEUTENANT It's pure. REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof. The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY EARS... CHIEF GOON (O.S.) Let's do it. He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook. BOAT THUG I Hold it. Let's see the money. Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the CRANE. ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the air. ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic. ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range. BOAT THUG I YOU SON OF A BITCH! (to another BOAT THUG) Go after it. Get the money. GO!! He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys -- diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the pilothouse: BOAT THUG I Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!! ANOTHER BOAT THUG LOOK! BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. She bares her teeth and HISSES. It's a woman. BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps to the deck, lifeless. The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the moonlight. The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS. PUNK Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!! CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL. ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water. Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the Gotham Zoological Gardens. A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN -- and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK standing in the open doorway. FRICK Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived. PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in. The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water. INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. FRICK opens a door and ushers her into... INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. PENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet. SELINA At last we meet. -- Pigeons? PENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. May I? She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. SELINA I've located the others. All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. PENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees. Germs find me inhospitable. SELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. PENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once. Champagne? She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. PENGUIN (cont.) My dear. Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. CUT TO: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. BULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio. El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! GORDON What's that he keeps saying? BULLOCK "Murcielago." -- Bat. GORDON Nonsense. That dock looked like a slaughter-house. Batman's never committed murder. BULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: POLICEMAN Commissioner? We've got Barrett. INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. BARRETT Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- GORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. BARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in attendance... GORDON Book the son of a bitch. GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away... BARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. CUT TO: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: SHAW Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour behind as it is!! A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily... HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly. His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been personally betrayed. SHAW Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo! He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly. He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT signals to him: HARDHAT Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's urgent. SHAW (to tbe SURVEYOR) Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash. He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a CELLULAR PHONE. INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his one phone call to contact the construction magnate. BARRETT It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I want you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last night. SHAW Jesus, Walter, I -- (suddenly puzzled) Why are you calling me?? BARRETT It's worse than that. Somebody took my raven. SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief. ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the facade of the tenement. SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued, gets it all on film... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the SQUATTER FAMILY. SCHULTZ Great stuff, but we're looking at a shitfight with our beloved publisher. He and Shaw... (crossing his fingers) Old money sticks together. VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his car. VICKI I'd sure like to know what shook him up so. He was out of there like a scared rabbit... Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to SCHULTZ's desk. WILK Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that massacre on the docks? Batman. VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is hot. EDITOR Whoa! Is this on the level? WILK Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" (grinning; to VICKI) Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a notch. VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the face: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead. VICKI Seen the late edition? ALFRED I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the library. They pause in front of the television -- which is tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot issue of the day. ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV) Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years. If he is mixed up with drugs... PUNDIT (on TV) That's not the issue. The issue is, do we entrust our public safety to some...masked vigilante. Does Batman have a license to kill? ALFRED (shaking his head) Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle. VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV) Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO WHAT? They deserved it! End of discussion. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker... GORDON (O.S.; filter) Anyone could've written that note. INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS -- blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping. CITY OFFICIAL I And I suppose anyone could've taken out a boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim -- murdered in cold blood -- GORDON Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds of lives! CITY OFFICIAL II He's still a vigilante. We don't know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it... CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES." INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE as he LISTENS through his concealed bug. CITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning. It would sure help if we could get that mask off... BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and VICKI -- BRUCE Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... COP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat 10-78. VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37. Backup on the way. EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: BATMAN Evasive. SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. CUT TO: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... WOMAN It's a fake. SHAW Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? WOMAN Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. SHAW I guess you'd know. I have some "friends" in the art world. They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. WOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. SHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. WOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you hear? SHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it. SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... SELINA I find that the old methods work best. Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single finger. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS, twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost. SHAW Hey, what are you doing -- ? He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across the face. SELINA You're very inquisitive. You'll just have to be disciplined. An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- SHAW You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before. -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems perfectly appropriate in this context. SELINA I think people should indulge their fantasies. Don't you? Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX- INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile fades... SHAW Hey, what are those -- what are you -- He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we CUT TO: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel nearby. INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE -- concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles over a nearby intercom: GUARD (O.S.; filter) Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? -- Mr. Shaw? Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place. EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and streak off toward SHAW's building. EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter) -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall Shaw. Repeat, all units -- BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo. But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS. He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise past far below. INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed -- -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT. COP JESUS! EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber -- -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street... EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the intersection. EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed... ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her... She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... LOOKING FOR LOVE? He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. COP Hey. You see what I saw...? This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. BULLOCK It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. -- We just made Batman up on the roof. GORDON Oh God. EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. VICKI Please, just one. It's important for people to see what's happening. HOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady. They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better. It always does. VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with astonishment. It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light out again when -- VICKI WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank you. I -- KID (cautiously) Twenty. VICKI What? KID Twenty bucks. VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other for a long moment -- VICKI ...Who are you? KID Dick. -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb... For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE -- BRUCE's great-grandfather. As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. Home sweet home. EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the homeless are entitled to their privacy... CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor, cradles it in her arms... WOMAN'S VOICE Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny little bird -- It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He bares his teeth: PENGUIN Do you want me to wring that creature's neck? SELINA You try it, I'll do the same to you. (as he grumbles; bemused) I saw him, you know. PENGUIN Saw who? SELINA Batman. He was dreamy. She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his polishing cloth, startled. PENGUIN Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God -- (sputtering wildly) Are you sure it was him? What did he do? SELINA He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. (smiling) But he was definitely interested. This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or waddling.) PENGUIN This scheme of yours is backfiring. We don't need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake here? SELINA Money isn't everything. (casually) What's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves? She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and SQUAWKS. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9 shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is walking VICKI to work. VICKI Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then vanished into a drainage pipe -- right next to the statue of General Wayne. BRUCE My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it's the same kid we heard about? VICKI Must be. He reminded me of you. BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM: NEW BAT-MURDER? Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI: BRUCE -- You work for this rag? (snatching up a paper) Your boss is calling for Gordon's resignation -- unless he brings Batman in for questioning... VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the street. THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't approve... BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage: BRUCE I need a good PR man. NEWS VENDOR Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'? With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack. VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe. VICKI That's what happens when you go after the rich and powerful. BRUCE Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich and powerful -- As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS." Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps walking... VICKI Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way. I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people like that were really scared, maybe they'd -- She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at his sleeve. VICKI (cont.) Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that later. BRUCE Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad. Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were too." VICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? BRUCE It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..." VICKI What does she want -- a date? BRUCE She's trying to contact me. Says she's gonna leave me another ad... The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury... INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: VICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? PROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead -- VICKI But the project's still going ahead! If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- PROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens! That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His family is in mourning. And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. VICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? PROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark. For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He tears it open -- -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. REPORTER I Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the arraignment? REPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? ATTORNEY Stand back! My client has nothing to say at this time! The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around it... As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. BARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society. Get back to me... Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later -- another SPLAT. BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. DRIVER Just washed it, too. The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. CUT TO: INT. BATCAVE - DAY TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. ALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. BRUCE Cancel. ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. SEKOWSKY Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !! At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of the Batcave. BRUCE Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted man. (beat) "New evidence"...I've gotta find that woman. Did you check the personals? As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a microphone: ALFRED Who's there? GORDON Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see Bruce. A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in. ALFRED Mr. Wayne will see you, sir. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no. He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be here. GORDON Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get right down to it. You knew Shaw and Barrett -- BRUCE I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim... GORDON Did you have any...dealings with them, or -- BRUCE No. I never liked the way they did business. GORDON The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind -- the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of thing -- and, uh... (taking a card from his pocket) Harrison Provost got this in the mail. BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest... BRUCE Then Batman is behind all this. GORDON Batman or a damned good imitation. BRUCE Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he. GORDON (shrugging; at a loss) Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a druglord, major polluter -- they weren't exactly model citizens. Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing. BRUCE You mean he's going after...the root of the problem. GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the card. GORDON Let me know if you get one of these. We'll put all our resources at your disposal. BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears. BRUCE Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS, MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has been set up as a wet bar. On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall, rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE. The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains, statuary and all. Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess... VICKI What is it? BRUCE I just had a weird sense of deja vu. He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate -- the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't quite make out... TIPTREE Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce. We owe him that much. BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them. PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of nonchalance. PROVOST (cont.) The man's a space cadet. Let him look out for himself. (as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully) Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise. BRUCE Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. (looking around) In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now -- TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused. PROVOST Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce? BRUCE Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards. TIPTREE PROVOST Oh, that's absurd. I already have. The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake from The Newlywed Game. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face: BRUCE Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you? PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of CHAMPAGNE... SELINA You two look like you need a drink. -- And is this who I think it is? She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless. PROVOST Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne. SELINA Our absentee board member! I've been wanting to meet you forever. TIPTREE Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block -- SELINA You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: SELINA (cont.) Major contributor. -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising... BRUCE I can't imagine why. SELINA Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads. BRUCE They're proccupied. This string of murders -- SELINA I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused... ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown crosses her face... ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue. SELINA -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess. BRUCE I think we've already met. -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. SELINA I'm glad you think so. I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. BRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. SELINA Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just that I'd always heard you were... BRUCE What? SELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... BRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No. Come on. What? BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. BRUCE Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. SELINA The photographer. I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. VICKI The Globe. SELINA Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. -- What an original dress! VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. BRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. VICKI Really. She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? SELINA It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah. She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have some boring museum business to talk about. VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. SELINA (cont.) I. Short leash. BRUCE Pull in the claws, okay? She's really terrific. SELINA I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you. Come by sometime. I'll give you the private tour. BRUCE Wait. Let me explain about Vicki -- SELINA (shushing him) I understand. Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. VICKI How's "business"? BRUCE Relax, okay? I like you better. He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No luck. VICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. CUT TO: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER." INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, sotto voce, into the phone: PROVOST Don't worry about that. I've had the office swept for bugs. No one's listening... INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His VOICE QUAVERS: TIPTREE It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was over a century ago. It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know? How could Batman know about the Raven Society?? INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT PROVOST Who knows and who cares. The point is, it's happened... He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes his conversation -- PROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me. I suggest you do the same. INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE taped to its leg. PROVOST (O.S.) I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't repeat this to anyone. CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat: SELINA He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned. PENGUIN Then he is an idiot. SELINA He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed. PENGUIN How do you plan to do that? SELINA How do you think! A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself, lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the doorway. FRICK It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation. PENGUIN Good! That should save us a trip to the bank. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens... BRUCE What have we got here? SELINA Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis. -- Oh, careful! BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape, jackal, man, falcon. SELINA (cont.) Canopic jars. In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine -- BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder. BRUCE You're in a gruesome line of work. SELINA Keeps me interested. And that's not easy to do... BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON. BRUCE This one I know. It's a gryphon, right? SELINA Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice. BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long moment and CHUCKLES. BRUCE Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. SELINA Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression. BRUCE What was it you wanted to talk to me about? SELINA Your collection. I'd love to see it. I mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE braces himself... SELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again. Does she know you're here -- Vicki? BRUCE (shrugging) No. SELINA It must be strange. Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to. BRUCE What are you attracted to? SELINA I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life. Having everything you want. No variety, no...danger. And every once in a while you need to take a risk. Shake it all up. BRUCE How? SELINA Maybe by...coming here today. She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's letting him have it with both barrels. SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- SELINA Are you okay? BRUCE Is there a cat in here? Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. BRUCE (cont.) Get it away! She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes. SELINA Poor thing. You're allergic! BRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. He glances at the building directly across the square from him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back to wait. INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the fleet... INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. PROVOST Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? LEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight from the bank vault. GUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. GUARD II We'll check the stairs. See you on the roof. The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: PROVOST No -- my private elevator. It's safer. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like, swooping and gliding among the gears and cables... EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He smiles back at his pal. GUARD No way. They don't pay us enough to tangle with Batm-- A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The car stops with a lurch. PROVOST What is it?? What's happening?? Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs. Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the music... EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades. He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon sign... EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling, but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with stiffs... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points up at the LIGHT: GUARD There. Mr. Provost. See? The generator's kicked in. It's just an electrical problem. PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them... PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move. GUARD There. See? It's moving. We're fine. PROVOST It's going down. We're going DOWN!!! INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR. They're patiently riding it down as it descends... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM. GUARD Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look through the trap door. But I need you to help me. Okay? You have to help. PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't reach it... He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the panel slightly. More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness. GUARD Probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to give me a boost. The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door. GUARD (cont.) Okay, help me out...steady... PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and tries to hoist him upward. INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls himself upward. He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling. PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees. All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on -- even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome... Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond recognition, his eyes gone altogether. PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and SHRIEKS AGAIN. The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage, PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares, ladies' lingerie! PROVOST W-who is this?? INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. PENGUIN Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. PROVOST Who are you?? Why are you doing this?? INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader. And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN PENGUIN Going down! He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post -- -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: CROWD Ten! Nine!... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: CROWD ...Three! Two! One! The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... NEWS VENDOR Hey! No! I aleady got a -- He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door -- The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders. ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant Christmas tree. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES. They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM TOO. A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as the BATS converge on him. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their hairdos. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at the chaos, TAUNTING him. EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN. EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a shaky hand... BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE SCULPTURE... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead. Finish 'em off... His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof. CATWOMAN (O.S.) You might as well. You're going to get blamed for it anyway. He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof, clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a Batarang. CATWOMAN (O.S.) Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it! BATMAN Who are you? He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up, but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS, knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat. He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and lands on her feet. Cats always do... CATWOMAN My, aren't we frisky tonight. He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows -- CATWOMAN I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one... He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still turning... BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free -- FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and KICKS UPWARD with startling force. This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER. He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on him. She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward, toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the helicopter! The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can -- With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees them poised directly above his EYES -- -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and circle each other... SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant -- a sudden CRACK -- -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT- O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the door is louder... CATWOMAN Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat. She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, DISAPPEARING -- -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof. CUT TO: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door. Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all the ruckus -- -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS A TRIGGER. ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across the glass. The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW... EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. PENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- CATWOMAN Ooh. Where have you been all my life? He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down. A sudden CRACK -- The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see the RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore. Nevermore! Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. CATWOMAN Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships. Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm just playful... BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to you! Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. ANGLE ON BATMAN He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. ANGLE ON CATWOMAN She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. CATWOMAN Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... CATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you. And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! CATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten feet... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the CORNICE -- -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down... ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his cape begin to INFLATE... Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge. Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS. Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street... ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES. Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION. EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the street: DRIVER What the hell is this? CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches over -- TRAFFIC COP Awright, what's the problem here? (spotting BATMAN) Jesus. He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN rush up to join him. They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back. The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters... PATROLMAN Good God. Cowan -- get to the car -- radio the commissioner!! By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection, all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to beat them back. TRAFFIC COP Is he dead? What do we do? PATROLMAN The mask. Get the mask off. They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask -- but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels around -- TRAFFIC COP Some kinda seam here on the neck... The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open -- -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward, shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes. Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced. One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion. On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF -- TRAFFIC COP DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd -- Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living. SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back -- Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the pavement. Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles -- EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam, drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars... Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount. BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels, maneuvering through traffic... EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK grabs the radio mike: BULLOCK Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We'll have to go in on foot... As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN. Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park. INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to the park. RED BERET I This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens around here anymore. The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now, SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park... INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than twenty yards away. He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough getting out of here... Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather, GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI and gets an inspiration. He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must be where the boy vigilante holes up... He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose and crawls inside. INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in the floor. RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train tracks below. Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the costume abruptly -- -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: DICK It's MINE! He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. DICK NO. WAIT! BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: COP Dumb son of a bitch!! The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. CUT TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. BRUCE Great. What'd you tell him? ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. BRUCE It's just a few bruises. ALFRED One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire body. BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block, munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks up his RADIO MIKE: PLAINCLOTHESMAN Mailman's coming. EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone, sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside -- unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in for the long haul. The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON: GORDON Anything suspicious! In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open. COP Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills. He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the kitchen. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.) Commissioner -- ? INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown- paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE TIN. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT It's a fruitcake. He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look. GORDON ...Have it analyzed. INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an extended vacation. POLICEMAN Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here. TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's sleeve. LITTLE GIRL I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy. MRS. TIPTREE She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can. LITTLE GIRL She's old. She doesn't even have cable. LITTLE BOY What about our presents? He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the parlor. TIPTREE Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's hand. GORDON Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along. MRS. TIPTREE Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye... Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON aside. TIPTREE They'll be safe, won't they? GORDON As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about. TIPTREE I told you. I... TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is convinced he's holding something back. GORDON You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns to go. GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas. GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move... ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly, then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver... TIPTREE Hello...? VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth -- The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment. TIPTREE Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New Year's. TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt. INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE. A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK. He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in. He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. CUT TO: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. SELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- SELINA (cont.) Bruce! BRUCE Selina. What are you doing here? ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a barnacle. SELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable. How long have you had him? INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. BRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. SELINA It's incredibly awful. It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. BRUCE Same here. SELINA It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused. Don't you think? BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of aroused. INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop. SELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? BRUCE Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste. SELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind. I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. ALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. BRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... ALFRED What exactly are you -- BRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. ALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- BRUCE Could be. Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? ALFRED Raven, sir? BRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. ALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- BRUCE What, Alfred? ALFRED Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk. This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. BRUCE What happened to it? ALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. BRUCE Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree? ALFRED George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's father. CUT TO: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell... INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a battery of COPS pat him down. BRUCE What are you looking for -- Batarangs? TIPTREE Bruce! Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone. The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs. INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him. BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX. BRUCE I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on, and he obliges... TIPTREE ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. BRUCE I think you may have something that belonged to my father. TIPTREE -- You know? He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his hands. TIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him the last two ravens. He's already got the others. BRUCE What are you talking about? Who? TIPTREE Batman. I don't know how he found out, but -- TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands. BRUCE It's time you told me what's going on here. TIPTREE Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune. BRUCE Whose fortune? TIPTREE Gotham City's. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming, POLICE rushing to the scene... TIPTREE In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted. It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision. The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion... A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a GATLING GUN into the crowd. POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE. TIPTREE (V.O.) The city was going under. Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out. In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE BRUCE The Five Families. TIPTREE Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City -- carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps. And in all this time no one's ever suspected -- BRUCE -- that they were the ones behind the robbery? FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne Manor, raising a celebratory toast. CAMERA PANS OVER to a nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES. TIPTREE (O.S.) They had five ravens made. Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it. They never needed to. It's still there to this day. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE TIPTREE The ravens, and the secret -- have been passed down through generations. Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you. BRUCE So they stole his piece of the puzzle. TIPTREE Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over. He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up. BRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott. My father was a decent man -- an honorable man. He would never have taken part in a scheme like this. TIPTREE It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was -- BRUCE That doesn't matter. If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to -- TIPTREE Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it out for you?!? BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine. TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man. He was an honorable man. That's why they had him killed. CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace. THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. TIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due. Now the bill's come due. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun. A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down. Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS. He makes no move to answer it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee. ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. ALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. VICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must be something we can do. ALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate -- or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone. BRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. BRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. ALFRED I see, sir. When shall we expect you back? BRUCE Get your cap. You're driving. INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE. The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA." With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... STAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. COP Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you -- HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. COP We've gotta get back to the radio. INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: DEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face. Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK -- glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands it over anyway. Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen. BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently. ALFRED's up front, at the wheel. BRUCE According to this, he's directly below us. ALFRED The subway, sir? BRUCE Yeah. Take a right. INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as they scan the crowd. Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold the SUITCASE out of view. INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the train lurches forward... False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again. INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations. As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious suitcase. He sits there panting... Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line! Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin -- FRACK... WIPE TO: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a WOMAN in a long fur coat. TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell, STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face. It is, of course, SELINA... TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform, and STRUTS in front of him. MYNAH FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME. The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of the tunnel: MYNAH (O.S.) FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to walk... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer. BRUCE He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park. ALFRED How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token. BRUCE I know another way in. (beat) Step on it. They're down there waiting for him. ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse... INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes, we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot intervals. He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel... ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with the suitcase who's invaded their domain. TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows. His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the park. INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of the bird's shrill voice to guide him: MYNAH AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME. TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE... VOICE STOP THERE. The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA. TIPTREE I've cooperated. I've done everything you said. PENGUIN Open the case. TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. PENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? TIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want. There's no need to -- PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go. TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily. TIPTREE My family. You won't -- PENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. TIPTREE We -- ?!? (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman. PENGUIN No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out. INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. CATWOMAN That idiot. Another six feet -- PENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought two ravens. We've got a complete set! CATWOMAN What?? PENGUIN Yeah! They're in the suitcase -- An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... CATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK watching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the scene of the melee... INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a hand: no mas... He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train passes -- -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN... A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated... CATWOMAN God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot? PENGUIN Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot. That was exhausting. CATWOMAN No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're not out of here yet. She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him... As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back -- past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF TUNNELS -- -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his gaze falls on DICK. He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL... INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT. The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City Hall was erected. He shouts up: PENGUIN LETS DO IT! INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony. Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families... The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust with a RAVEN. When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up: PENGUIN Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn. His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its recessed socket, in quick succession... INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing happens. CATWOMAN What happens now? PENGUIN I don't know. That's all...! He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING, flapping his arms like wings. PENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's a -- He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass case... The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into view... INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to get at the box. FRICK That's the treasure? CATWOMAN No. It's a map... She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER. INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him. He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps over to his side: PENGUIN Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this. It's right under Wayne Manor. It's been there all along! Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES -- an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION... PENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave. FADE THROUGH TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a yelp. VICKI No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings. VICKI (cont.) It's all right. You're safe. You can stay here as long as you need to. DICK I don't belong here. You can't keep me here. Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. VICKI It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer "Richard"? He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the breast. VICKI "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? DICK It's none of your business. What is this, some kind of home? VICKI No, not that kind. There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. DICK Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How the hell would you know what I want? VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- DICK I'm not staying. You can't make me -- -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. BRUCE I can make you. DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm in Batman's house. BRUCE (cont.) Come on. Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room. INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall. ALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? BRUCE I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about. ALFRED The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. BRUCE He hasn't got any parents. ALFRED How do you know that, sir? BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. BRUCE ...I know. The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the mouthpiece: ALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. SELINA Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still on for tonight? INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his look we DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. ALFRED Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is Christmas eve. BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. BRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. ALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. BRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to take her out tonight. INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird household he's landed in... INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand. BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly: SELINA You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite dressed. BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts. The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it, yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out. SELINA (cont.) If you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners. BRUCE Christmas eve. No tree? SELINA No presents. I've been a bad girl this year. BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby wet bar. BRUCE I'm surprised you kept this date. I thought you would've lost interest by now. SELINA What makes you say that? BRUCE You've got what you want, don't you? SELINA I do now. (smiling) We've had this date for a long, long time. With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny look. BRUCE How much is it going to cost me? SELINA What? BRUCE ...To get the ravens back. He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion. SELINA You're the oddest man I've ever met. (moving in on him) Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of a short fuse... BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way downward, kissing him around his neck and throat... HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it -- He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him... Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand. SELINA Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll start to enjoy it. BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen. SELINA (cont.) Bruce, you look faint. It must be the cats. BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem to work. SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form -- purring and stretching... BRUCE'S POV A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus. BRUCE What di-- what did you d-- She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright red. SELINA I guess I've...gotten under your skin. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG. He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually going slack. The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on schedule. INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's boys. ALFRED Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour. Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven o'clock. INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a window and throws the bundle outside. There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS. INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. PENGUIN Try his mag card. FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED CAPSULES. FRICK Look at this. He's a pillhead. Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. VICKI Ohh. Am I glad to -- To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. PENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. VICKI What did you do to him?? SELINA gives her a catty little smile. SELINA First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. PENGUIN You'd be the butler. Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. ALFRED Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ? PENGUIN You know how it is. Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. PENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? VICKI I don't know what you're talking about. PENGUIN The cave. Under the house. How do I get there? The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head. VICKI (cont.) I don't know! I swear, I would tell you -- PENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. ALFRED You're no more than a common thief. PENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- ALFRED I...don't...know... PENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he can speak -- SELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself. So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK. PENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. PENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of disgust. PENGUIN (cont.) I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think I'm...nouveau. ALFRED I think you're a dirty little man with a -- The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK reappear. PENGUIN See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. (smirking) I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money too -- when the statute of limitations runs out. SELINA (O.S.) Hey! -- Guess what I just found. Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of... SELINA (cont.) Christmas cookies! The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with limited enthusiasm. PENGUIN Let's spread out and see what we can find. (to FRICK and FRACK) You two -- keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to. FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE -- -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands STRUGGLING against his bonds. SERIES OF SHOTS QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out of frames, etc. Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on ALFRED and VICKI. INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and fumbles for the lock -- INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED... FRICK Better check it out. FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself. FRICK (cont.) What is it? What's going on?? VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a clear view of DICK and BRUCE. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds -- and SHOUTS: FRACK Some kind of security system -- INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and crumples in a heap. DICK Can you move, man? BRUCE Library -- got to get me to the library -- DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch the situation develop. INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway: PENGUIN What is that ungodly racket? FRACK A security alarm. It went off in the kitchen. PENGUIN My God! Is someone in here? He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are still poised in the doorway. It looks bad... INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat -- -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and vanish -- -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor. FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point- blank range. VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying. INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret switch. He's CRYING. BRUCE Alfred... DICK I'll go back. BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. VICKI SHUT UP. Help me with him. The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? FRICK Yes sir. PENGUIN Oh, good. That does relieve my mind -- He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face. PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. INSERT - MONITOR The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. PENGUIN Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly -- -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal. You know what to do. DICK nods yes and bolts off. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI! RUN! NOW! She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. DICK Here. You might need it. ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a dial tone -- VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other end, reeling her closer. SELINA You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch -- VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: CLANG. VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in the wood. VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose. INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI. SELINA I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off. VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA, who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up. INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her and LOCKING IT. SELINA HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty... She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there paralyzed as SELINA advances. SELINA So this is where you earn your keep. She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA kneels atop her... SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly section of bra -- SELINA Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham? She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK uncontrollably. SELINA Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep... She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the moonlit bed. SELINA tenses -- -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair -- BATMAN Miss me, "Angel"? He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges. INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself up. SELINA Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me... all the way this time. She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long stairway. She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner. BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN -- slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out cold. A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side -- VICKI Come on. We'll be safe in the cave. INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously... ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him. But then -- -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again. It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES, knocking over another -- and another -- -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering PENGUIN. SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA. SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around enough to dig himself out. INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open... INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to DICK: VICKI Come on. Come with us. DICK No. I can still help... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. WIPE TO: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: PENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move. I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. PENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to be stolen twice. ALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. PENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we? You go first. He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. SELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. BATMAN It's over. I don't want to hurt you any more. SELINA Tell me something -- one thing. If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good answer. She sighs. SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares up at him. BATMAN Nine lives. CATWOMAN I can't move. I can't move. Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still cautious... CATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want. Please? BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. BATMAN No. BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another gruesome WHINE. CATWOMAN COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch. You're all alike... Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to slit her own throat. He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. DICK You should've done it, man. You should've killed her. BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. BATMAN There's a radio in the cave. We'll send for help. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. PENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you now. Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a cautious step backward. CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks. PENGUIN No sudden moves. It's a long way down. Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto... HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down, above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them -- their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN... He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto... ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM. VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life. BATMAN VICKI! An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down across the rocks. With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her -- -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN. THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE RAILING. VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand. Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip. The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then -- BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares down at it, and two beats later -- -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there, PARALYZED. He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM -- -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether... BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace on the edge of the abyss. On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted, clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs, flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an ambulance. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g., a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound. GORDON ...and then Batman showed up? BRUCE He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders. GORDON God -- I pray you're right. (beat) One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the kid? BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are righting the fallen Christmas tree. BRUCE Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in town for the holidays. GORDON Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. (turning to go) Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up. GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR. BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front parlor. INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to BRUCE: VICKI What are you going to do with all that gold? BRUCE I dunno. Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one. She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve. VICKI It's Christmas. BRUCE Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your present. She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly. VICKI Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None of it matters. We're all safe. We're together. BRUCE ...You might as well. He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside. She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back. CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them; ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace. And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we FADE OUT. THE END
BATMAN 2

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

     It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
     uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has
     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation
     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as
     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
     "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
     Christmas."

     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
     wants more.

     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
     BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this
     winter, Batmania is everywhere...

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,
     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
     the few passersby.

     They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent
     Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides
     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
     of year.

     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

     EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows
     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
     into a drift.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give
     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
     Salvation Army SANTA...

     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The
     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
     burdened with LOOT.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid
     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of
     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

     EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple
     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,
     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are
     obviously going to get away clean -- unless...

     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes
     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

                               COP
               What the hell -- ?

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the
     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's
     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A
     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio
     mike:

                               COP WITH MIKE
               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!
                    (pause)
               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the
     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
     stopping...

     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second
     later...

     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS
     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of
     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

                               COP I
               ...That was Batman.

                               COP II
               NO SHIT!!

     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
     a path, they might as well join in the chase...

     EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
     horizon...

     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they
     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the
     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

     EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES
     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the
     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
     COPS race past him on foot.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up
     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
     left and right...

     ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
     disappear.

     ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
     hill...

     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

     ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
     explodes harmlessly.

     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
     ITSELF into a distant TREE.

     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
     heels into a drift.

     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

     EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They
     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
     disappear over a crest of a hill...

     EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
     of the lake.

     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
     sliding forward.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

     EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on
     the dashboard...

     EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost
     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
     know what's hit them.

     ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of
     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
     clearing...

     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
     to build up speed.

     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
     the Batmobile rises half a foot --

     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
     tracks.

     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
     almost atop him --

     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
     frame.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up
     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a
     dull ROAR in the distance...

     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
     colleague and SHRUGS:

                               COP I
               ...Merry Christmas.

     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

                               COP II
               Gift-wrapped and everything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER
     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

                               GORDON
               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
               in precious jewels were recovered intact
               by the police force -- working in concert
               with Batman.

     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
     crowd:

                               VOICES IN CROWD
               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE
               STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

     GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group
     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're
     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
     saw in the park.

     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
     over the din.

                               GORDON
               I would like to stress -- that while this
               city enjoys a special relationship with
               Batman --
                    (louder)
               -- we do not condone vigilantism --
                    (practically screaming)
               -- IN ANY FORM.

     It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
     continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he
     returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
     huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
     Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
     RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
     BAT."

                               SEKOWSKY
               And hey!  Where does this --
                    (BLEEP; expletive deleted)
               -- Gordon get off calling us ?
               We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a
               group of concerned citizens, that's all --
               just like Batman.

 WOMAN IN CROWD                You people are nothing but hoodlums!

 SEKOWSKY                Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
               riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
               like you.
                    (into mike)
               If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --

     MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a
     minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
     breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
     screen, placing us in:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
     with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of
     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
     the mike...

                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)
               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
               alive in this city.  We're gonna take back
               the streets!

     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
     chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
     flicks it off.

     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
     "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
     Sterling silver tea service.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
     side drawer.

     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."  ALFRED digs
     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
     the rear of the drawer.

     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

     INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
     "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
     wrapped in a tarp.

     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
 BRUCE. 
 ALFRED                Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
 A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. 
 BRUCE                I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly
     regains his composure:

 ALFRED                I took the liberty of preparing tea.
                    (indicating tbe monitors)
               I take it you've been watching the news?

     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
     and nods.

 BRUCE                Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off
     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops
     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

 ALFRED                I should inform you...Christmas is
               approaching, and we've received our annual
               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
                    (eyeing the equipment)
               If I may inquire...?

 BRUCE                Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
     like the skeleton of an umbrella.

 ALFRED                Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly it? BRUCE What does it look like? ALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. BRUCE Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right. BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. ALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... BRUCE We can do better than that. ALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on, concerned: ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir? BRUCE Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki. ALFRED (anxiously) Miss Vale, sir...? BRUCE Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas. BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED heaves an audible sigh of relief as we CUT TO: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS with quick, birdlike strokes. MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars -- and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door... GUARD Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy? MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname. GUARD (cont.) Boniface... MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out. INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD. PAROLE OFFICER You want to return the money you stole. BONIFACE Intact. The map will show you where it's buried. The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP. PAROLE OFFICER All of it. Forty-two million dollars. MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear. PAROLE OFFICER II Why this sudden change of heart? MR. BONIFACE Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full. I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people. PAROLE OFFICER II Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars?? MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type... WARDEN His record's clean. Thirteen years without an incident. ATTORNEY I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals... The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg. MR. BONIFACE Birds, yes. My only source of solace. PAROLE OFFICER In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole. BONIFACE Thank you, sir. You won't regret it. MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office: MYNAH CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES NOT PAY. CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board: ATTORNEY Personally trained by my client. INT. PRISON CELL - DAY Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE: MR. BONIFACE -- Where are my birds?!? T-BONE Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go. MR. BONIFACE Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of winter! T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR. BONIFACE's profound distress. T-BONE They were all cooped up. With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do. BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile... MR. BONIFACE I see. -- You might as well have this. I won't be needing it... He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the earphones... T-BONE Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours. T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: MR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and "business managers." FRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. PENGUIN Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning are about to pay off. INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. PENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? FRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. $42,271,009... PENGUIN How much have we got left? FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. FRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- PENGUIN Fine, fine. How much? FRICK Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the sum we buried. THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. PENGUIN Speaking of burials... EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the headphones... The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. T-BONE HEY -- ! He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird bird, bird is the word... EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. VICKI Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present for Bruce. She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... VICKI (cont.) Skis. -- Don't let on, okay? ALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. VICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for. -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? ALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree... VICKI Not so fast. She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. ALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! VOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI waves frantically. VICKI Don't look. It's your present. VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny box -- BRUCE What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against him. WHISPERS in his ear: VICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly, huddling against the cold. An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens, half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME." The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw Construction, Inc. A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby... INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the demonstration. VICKI Homeless. (beat) I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like there's more every day. BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to say. VICKI (cont.) Christmas time. And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park already. BRUCE -- Yeah. The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park. EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as BRUCE'S CAR pulls up. A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience -- as they enter. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park. VICKI They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown. These people don't have anyplace else to go. (beat) If the city starts selling off the park... BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings. HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance... BRUCE -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert. VICKI (taking his hand) Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of. BRUCE Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes -- VICKI That's not what I meant. They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with BRUCE. BRUCE -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. (long pause) I'm just a Band-Aid. VOICE FROM BEHIND Bruce! It's been ages! VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder. Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE. BRUCE Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's the construction business? SHAW The park tower? All systems go. If we can get the junkies and winos cleared out... (a big grin) Not too late to get in on the deal. BRUCE I'll think about it. SHAW Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe. We should all get together at the club. (clapping him on the shoulder) Nice to see you again, Miss Veal. "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth: VICKI What a pig. BRUCE I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too. VICKI Now he wants to gobble up the park... (shivering) Bruce -- isn't there something you can do about people like that? BRUCE What, tie him up with a bat-rope? VICKI No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce. BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the lot outside... The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS, in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS. BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a little closer -- within eavesdropping range: RED BERET I We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing. JOGGER I was attacked. Three men in ski masks -- COP I (indicating the RED BERETS) And these two broke it up? JOGGER These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never saw anybody take off so -- RED BERET II Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops. COP II You. SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? JOGGER A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: RED BERET I Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you. It's fulla bums. BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. BRUCE Nice outfit. RED BERET I Piss off, geek. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: ANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: RICKY Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps? In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back. RICKY (cont.) Midnight. No sweat. See you then. He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. SELINA Well. "Ricky," is it? RICKY How'd you know that? SELINA I heard you on the phone. Talking to your girlfriend. RICKY Girlfriend? No, no. That was business. SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. SELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. RICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. SELINA Why wouldn't they be? RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare. RICKY You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. SELINA Oh, they're real, all right. So are these. She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood. RICKY is hypnotized. She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. CUT TO: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major is about to happen... The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to a colleague: DOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? DOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid. And here we are freezin' our balls off... EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck. BOAT THUG I You pick. The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM -- revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER. POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the merchandise. LIEUTENANT It's pure. REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof. The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY EARS... CHIEF GOON (O.S.) Let's do it. He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook. BOAT THUG I Hold it. Let's see the money. Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the CRANE. ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the air. ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic. ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range. BOAT THUG I YOU SON OF A BITCH! (to another BOAT THUG) Go after it. Get the money. GO!! He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys -- diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the pilothouse: BOAT THUG I Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!! ANOTHER BOAT THUG LOOK! BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. She bares her teeth and HISSES. It's a woman. BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps to the deck, lifeless. The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the moonlight. The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS. PUNK Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!! CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL. ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water. Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the Gotham Zoological Gardens. A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN -- and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK standing in the open doorway. FRICK Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived. PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in. The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water. INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. FRICK opens a door and ushers her into... INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. PENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet. SELINA At last we meet. -- Pigeons? PENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. May I? She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. SELINA I've located the others. All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. PENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees. Germs find me inhospitable. SELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. PENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once. Champagne? She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. PENGUIN (cont.) My dear. Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. CUT TO: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. BULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio. El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! GORDON What's that he keeps saying? BULLOCK "Murcielago." -- Bat. GORDON Nonsense. That dock looked like a slaughter-house. Batman's never committed murder. BULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: POLICEMAN Commissioner? We've got Barrett. INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. BARRETT Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- GORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. BARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in attendance... GORDON Book the son of a bitch. GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away... BARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. CUT TO: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: SHAW Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour behind as it is!! A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily... HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly. His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been personally betrayed. SHAW Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo! He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly. He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT signals to him: HARDHAT Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's urgent. SHAW (to tbe SURVEYOR) Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash. He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a CELLULAR PHONE. INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his one phone call to contact the construction magnate. BARRETT It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I want you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last night. SHAW Jesus, Walter, I -- (suddenly puzzled) Why are you calling me?? BARRETT It's worse than that. Somebody took my raven. SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief. ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the facade of the tenement. SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued, gets it all on film... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the SQUATTER FAMILY. SCHULTZ Great stuff, but we're looking at a shitfight with our beloved publisher. He and Shaw... (crossing his fingers) Old money sticks together. VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his car. VICKI I'd sure like to know what shook him up so. He was out of there like a scared rabbit... Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to SCHULTZ's desk. WILK Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that massacre on the docks? Batman. VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is hot. EDITOR Whoa! Is this on the level? WILK Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" (grinning; to VICKI) Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a notch. VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the face: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead. VICKI Seen the late edition? ALFRED I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the library. They pause in front of the television -- which is tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot issue of the day. ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV) Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years. If he is mixed up with drugs... PUNDIT (on TV) That's not the issue. The issue is, do we entrust our public safety to some...masked vigilante. Does Batman have a license to kill? ALFRED (shaking his head) Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle. VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV) Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO WHAT? They deserved it! End of discussion. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker... GORDON (O.S.; filter) Anyone could've written that note. INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS -- blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping. CITY OFFICIAL I And I suppose anyone could've taken out a boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim -- murdered in cold blood -- GORDON Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds of lives! CITY OFFICIAL II He's still a vigilante. We don't know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it... CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES." INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE as he LISTENS through his concealed bug. CITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning. It would sure help if we could get that mask off... BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and VICKI -- BRUCE Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... COP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat 10-78. VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37. Backup on the way. EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: BATMAN Evasive. SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. CUT TO: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... WOMAN It's a fake. SHAW Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? WOMAN Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. SHAW I guess you'd know. I have some "friends" in the art world. They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. WOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. SHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. WOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you hear? SHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it. SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... SELINA I find that the old methods work best. Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single finger. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS, twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost. SHAW Hey, what are you doing -- ? He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across the face. SELINA You're very inquisitive. You'll just have to be disciplined. An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- SHAW You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before. -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems perfectly appropriate in this context. SELINA I think people should indulge their fantasies. Don't you? Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX- INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile fades... SHAW Hey, what are those -- what are you -- He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we CUT TO: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel nearby. INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE -- concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles over a nearby intercom: GUARD (O.S.; filter) Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? -- Mr. Shaw? Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place. EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and streak off toward SHAW's building. EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter) -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall Shaw. Repeat, all units -- BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo. But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS. He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise past far below. INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed -- -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT. COP JESUS! EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber -- -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street... EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the intersection. EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed... ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her... She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... LOOKING FOR LOVE? He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. COP Hey. You see what I saw...? This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. BULLOCK It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. -- We just made Batman up on the roof. GORDON Oh God. EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. VICKI Please, just one. It's important for people to see what's happening. HOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady. They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better. It always does. VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with astonishment. It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light out again when -- VICKI WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank you. I -- KID (cautiously) Twenty. VICKI What? KID Twenty bucks. VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other for a long moment -- VICKI ...Who are you? KID Dick. -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb... For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE -- BRUCE's great-grandfather. As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. Home sweet home. EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the homeless are entitled to their privacy... CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor, cradles it in her arms... WOMAN'S VOICE Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny little bird -- It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He bares his teeth: PENGUIN Do you want me to wring that creature's neck? SELINA You try it, I'll do the same to you. (as he grumbles; bemused) I saw him, you know. PENGUIN Saw who? SELINA Batman. He was dreamy. She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his polishing cloth, startled. PENGUIN Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God -- (sputtering wildly) Are you sure it was him? What did he do? SELINA He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. (smiling) But he was definitely interested. This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or waddling.) PENGUIN This scheme of yours is backfiring. We don't need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake here? SELINA Money isn't everything. (casually) What's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves? She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and SQUAWKS. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9 shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is walking VICKI to work. VICKI Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then vanished into a drainage pipe -- right next to the statue of General Wayne. BRUCE My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it's the same kid we heard about? VICKI Must be. He reminded me of you. BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM: NEW BAT-MURDER? Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI: BRUCE -- You work for this rag? (snatching up a paper) Your boss is calling for Gordon's resignation -- unless he brings Batman in for questioning... VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the street. THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't approve... BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage: BRUCE I need a good PR man. NEWS VENDOR Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'? With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack. VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe. VICKI That's what happens when you go after the rich and powerful. BRUCE Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich and powerful -- As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS." Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps walking... VICKI Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way. I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people like that were really scared, maybe they'd -- She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at his sleeve. VICKI (cont.) Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that later. BRUCE Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad. Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were too." VICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? BRUCE It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..." VICKI What does she want -- a date? BRUCE She's trying to contact me. Says she's gonna leave me another ad... The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury... INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: VICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? PROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead -- VICKI But the project's still going ahead! If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- PROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens! That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His family is in mourning. And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. VICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? PROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark. For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He tears it open -- -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. REPORTER I Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the arraignment? REPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? ATTORNEY Stand back! My client has nothing to say at this time! The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around it... As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. BARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society. Get back to me... Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later -- another SPLAT. BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. DRIVER Just washed it, too. The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. CUT TO: INT. BATCAVE - DAY TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. ALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. BRUCE Cancel. ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. SEKOWSKY Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !! At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of the Batcave. BRUCE Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted man. (beat) "New evidence"...I've gotta find that woman. Did you check the personals? As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a microphone: ALFRED Who's there? GORDON Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see Bruce. A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in. ALFRED Mr. Wayne will see you, sir. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no. He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be here. GORDON Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get right down to it. You knew Shaw and Barrett -- BRUCE I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim... GORDON Did you have any...dealings with them, or -- BRUCE No. I never liked the way they did business. GORDON The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind -- the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of thing -- and, uh... (taking a card from his pocket) Harrison Provost got this in the mail. BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest... BRUCE Then Batman is behind all this. GORDON Batman or a damned good imitation. BRUCE Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he. GORDON (shrugging; at a loss) Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a druglord, major polluter -- they weren't exactly model citizens. Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing. BRUCE You mean he's going after...the root of the problem. GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the card. GORDON Let me know if you get one of these. We'll put all our resources at your disposal. BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears. BRUCE Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS, MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has been set up as a wet bar. On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall, rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE. The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains, statuary and all. Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess... VICKI What is it? BRUCE I just had a weird sense of deja vu. He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate -- the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't quite make out... TIPTREE Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce. We owe him that much. BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them. PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of nonchalance. PROVOST (cont.) The man's a space cadet. Let him look out for himself. (as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully) Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise. BRUCE Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. (looking around) In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now -- TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused. PROVOST Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce? BRUCE Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards. TIPTREE PROVOST Oh, that's absurd. I already have. The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake from The Newlywed Game. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face: BRUCE Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you? PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of CHAMPAGNE... SELINA You two look like you need a drink. -- And is this who I think it is? She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless. PROVOST Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne. SELINA Our absentee board member! I've been wanting to meet you forever. TIPTREE Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block -- SELINA You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: SELINA (cont.) Major contributor. -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising... BRUCE I can't imagine why. SELINA Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads. BRUCE They're proccupied. This string of murders -- SELINA I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused... ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown crosses her face... ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue. SELINA -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess. BRUCE I think we've already met. -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. SELINA I'm glad you think so. I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. BRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. SELINA Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just that I'd always heard you were... BRUCE What? SELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... BRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No. Come on. What? BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. BRUCE Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. SELINA The photographer. I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. VICKI The Globe. SELINA Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. -- What an original dress! VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. BRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. VICKI Really. She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? SELINA It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah. She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have some boring museum business to talk about. VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. SELINA (cont.) I. Short leash. BRUCE Pull in the claws, okay? She's really terrific. SELINA I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you. Come by sometime. I'll give you the private tour. BRUCE Wait. Let me explain about Vicki -- SELINA (shushing him) I understand. Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. VICKI How's "business"? BRUCE Relax, okay? I like you better. He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No luck. VICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. CUT TO: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER." INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, sotto voce, into the phone: PROVOST Don't worry about that. I've had the office swept for bugs. No one's listening... INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His VOICE QUAVERS: TIPTREE It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was over a century ago. It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know? How could Batman know about the Raven Society?? INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT PROVOST Who knows and who cares. The point is, it's happened... He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes his conversation -- PROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me. I suggest you do the same. INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE taped to its leg. PROVOST (O.S.) I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't repeat this to anyone. CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat: SELINA He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned. PENGUIN Then he is an idiot. SELINA He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed. PENGUIN How do you plan to do that? SELINA How do you think! A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself, lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the doorway. FRICK It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation. PENGUIN Good! That should save us a trip to the bank. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens... BRUCE What have we got here? SELINA Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis. -- Oh, careful! BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape, jackal, man, falcon. SELINA (cont.) Canopic jars. In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine -- BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder. BRUCE You're in a gruesome line of work. SELINA Keeps me interested. And that's not easy to do... BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON. BRUCE This one I know. It's a gryphon, right? SELINA Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice. BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long moment and CHUCKLES. BRUCE Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. SELINA Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression. BRUCE What was it you wanted to talk to me about? SELINA Your collection. I'd love to see it. I mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE braces himself... SELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again. Does she know you're here -- Vicki? BRUCE (shrugging) No. SELINA It must be strange. Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to. BRUCE What are you attracted to? SELINA I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life. Having everything you want. No variety, no...danger. And every once in a while you need to take a risk. Shake it all up. BRUCE How? SELINA Maybe by...coming here today. She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's letting him have it with both barrels. SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- SELINA Are you okay? BRUCE Is there a cat in here? Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. BRUCE (cont.) Get it away! She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes. SELINA Poor thing. You're allergic! BRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. He glances at the building directly across the square from him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back to wait. INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the fleet... INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. PROVOST Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? LEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight from the bank vault. GUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. GUARD II We'll check the stairs. See you on the roof. The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: PROVOST No -- my private elevator. It's safer. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like, swooping and gliding among the gears and cables... EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He smiles back at his pal. GUARD No way. They don't pay us enough to tangle with Batm-- A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The car stops with a lurch. PROVOST What is it?? What's happening?? Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs. Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the music... EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades. He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon sign... EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling, but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with stiffs... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points up at the LIGHT: GUARD There. Mr. Provost. See? The generator's kicked in. It's just an electrical problem. PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them... PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move. GUARD There. See? It's moving. We're fine. PROVOST It's going down. We're going DOWN!!! INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR. They're patiently riding it down as it descends... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM. GUARD Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look through the trap door. But I need you to help me. Okay? You have to help. PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't reach it... He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the panel slightly. More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness. GUARD Probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to give me a boost. The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door. GUARD (cont.) Okay, help me out...steady... PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and tries to hoist him upward. INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls himself upward. He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling. PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees. All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on -- even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome... Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond recognition, his eyes gone altogether. PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and SHRIEKS AGAIN. The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage, PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares, ladies' lingerie! PROVOST W-who is this?? INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. PENGUIN Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. PROVOST Who are you?? Why are you doing this?? INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader. And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN PENGUIN Going down! He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post -- -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: CROWD Ten! Nine!... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: CROWD ...Three! Two! One! The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... NEWS VENDOR Hey! No! I aleady got a -- He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door -- The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders. ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant Christmas tree. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES. They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM TOO. A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as the BATS converge on him. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their hairdos. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at the chaos, TAUNTING him. EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN. EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a shaky hand... BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE SCULPTURE... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead. Finish 'em off... His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof. CATWOMAN (O.S.) You might as well. You're going to get blamed for it anyway. He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof, clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a Batarang. CATWOMAN (O.S.) Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it! BATMAN Who are you? He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up, but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS, knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat. He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and lands on her feet. Cats always do... CATWOMAN My, aren't we frisky tonight. He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows -- CATWOMAN I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one... He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still turning... BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free -- FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and KICKS UPWARD with startling force. This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER. He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on him. She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward, toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the helicopter! The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can -- With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees them poised directly above his EYES -- -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and circle each other... SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant -- a sudden CRACK -- -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT- O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the door is louder... CATWOMAN Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat. She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, DISAPPEARING -- -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof. CUT TO: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door. Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all the ruckus -- -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS A TRIGGER. ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across the glass. The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW... EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. PENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- CATWOMAN Ooh. Where have you been all my life? He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down. A sudden CRACK -- The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see the RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore. Nevermore! Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. CATWOMAN Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships. Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm just playful... BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to you! Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. ANGLE ON BATMAN He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. ANGLE ON CATWOMAN She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. CATWOMAN Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... CATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you. And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! CATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten feet... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the CORNICE -- -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down... ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his cape begin to INFLATE... Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge. Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS. Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street... ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES. Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION. EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the street: DRIVER What the hell is this? CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches over -- TRAFFIC COP Awright, what's the problem here? (spotting BATMAN) Jesus. He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN rush up to join him. They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back. The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters... PATROLMAN Good God. Cowan -- get to the car -- radio the commissioner!! By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection, all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to beat them back. TRAFFIC COP Is he dead? What do we do? PATROLMAN The mask. Get the mask off. They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask -- but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels around -- TRAFFIC COP Some kinda seam here on the neck... The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open -- -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward, shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes. Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced. One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion. On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF -- TRAFFIC COP DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd -- Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living. SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back -- Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the pavement. Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles -- EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam, drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars... Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount. BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels, maneuvering through traffic... EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK grabs the radio mike: BULLOCK Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We'll have to go in on foot... As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN. Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park. INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to the park. RED BERET I This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens around here anymore. The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now, SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park... INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than twenty yards away. He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough getting out of here... Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather, GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI and gets an inspiration. He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must be where the boy vigilante holes up... He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose and crawls inside. INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in the floor. RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train tracks below. Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the costume abruptly -- -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: DICK It's MINE! He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. DICK NO. WAIT! BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: COP Dumb son of a bitch!! The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. CUT TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. BRUCE Great. What'd you tell him? ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. BRUCE It's just a few bruises. ALFRED One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire body. BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block, munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks up his RADIO MIKE: PLAINCLOTHESMAN Mailman's coming. EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone, sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside -- unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in for the long haul. The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON: GORDON Anything suspicious! In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open. COP Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills. He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the kitchen. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.) Commissioner -- ? INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown- paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE TIN. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT It's a fruitcake. He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look. GORDON ...Have it analyzed. INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an extended vacation. POLICEMAN Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here. TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's sleeve. LITTLE GIRL I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy. MRS. TIPTREE She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can. LITTLE GIRL She's old. She doesn't even have cable. LITTLE BOY What about our presents? He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the parlor. TIPTREE Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's hand. GORDON Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along. MRS. TIPTREE Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye... Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON aside. TIPTREE They'll be safe, won't they? GORDON As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about. TIPTREE I told you. I... TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is convinced he's holding something back. GORDON You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns to go. GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas. GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move... ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly, then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver... TIPTREE Hello...? VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth -- The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment. TIPTREE Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New Year's. TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt. INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE. A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK. He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in. He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. CUT TO: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. SELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- SELINA (cont.) Bruce! BRUCE Selina. What are you doing here? ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a barnacle. SELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable. How long have you had him? INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. BRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. SELINA It's incredibly awful. It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. BRUCE Same here. SELINA It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused. Don't you think? BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of aroused. INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop. SELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? BRUCE Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste. SELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind. I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. ALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. BRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... ALFRED What exactly are you -- BRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. ALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- BRUCE Could be. Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? ALFRED Raven, sir? BRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. ALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- BRUCE What, Alfred? ALFRED Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk. This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. BRUCE What happened to it? ALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. BRUCE Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree? ALFRED George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's father. CUT TO: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell... INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a battery of COPS pat him down. BRUCE What are you looking for -- Batarangs? TIPTREE Bruce! Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone. The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs. INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him. BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX. BRUCE I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on, and he obliges... TIPTREE ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. BRUCE I think you may have something that belonged to my father. TIPTREE -- You know? He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his hands. TIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him the last two ravens. He's already got the others. BRUCE What are you talking about? Who? TIPTREE Batman. I don't know how he found out, but -- TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands. BRUCE It's time you told me what's going on here. TIPTREE Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune. BRUCE Whose fortune? TIPTREE Gotham City's. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming, POLICE rushing to the scene... TIPTREE In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted. It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision. The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion... A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a GATLING GUN into the crowd. POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE. TIPTREE (V.O.) The city was going under. Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out. In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE BRUCE The Five Families. TIPTREE Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City -- carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps. And in all this time no one's ever suspected -- BRUCE -- that they were the ones behind the robbery? FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne Manor, raising a celebratory toast. CAMERA PANS OVER to a nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES. TIPTREE (O.S.) They had five ravens made. Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it. They never needed to. It's still there to this day. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE TIPTREE The ravens, and the secret -- have been passed down through generations. Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you. BRUCE So they stole his piece of the puzzle. TIPTREE Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over. He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up. BRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott. My father was a decent man -- an honorable man. He would never have taken part in a scheme like this. TIPTREE It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was -- BRUCE That doesn't matter. If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to -- TIPTREE Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it out for you?!? BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine. TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man. He was an honorable man. That's why they had him killed. CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace. THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. TIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due. Now the bill's come due. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun. A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down. Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS. He makes no move to answer it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee. ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. ALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. VICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must be something we can do. ALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate -- or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone. BRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. BRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. ALFRED I see, sir. When shall we expect you back? BRUCE Get your cap. You're driving. INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE. The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA." With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... STAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. COP Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you -- HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. COP We've gotta get back to the radio. INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: DEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face. Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK -- glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands it over anyway. Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen. BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently. ALFRED's up front, at the wheel. BRUCE According to this, he's directly below us. ALFRED The subway, sir? BRUCE Yeah. Take a right. INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as they scan the crowd. Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold the SUITCASE out of view. INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the train lurches forward... False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again. INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations. As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious suitcase. He sits there panting... Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line! Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin -- FRACK... WIPE TO: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a WOMAN in a long fur coat. TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell, STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face. It is, of course, SELINA... TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform, and STRUTS in front of him. MYNAH FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME. The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of the tunnel: MYNAH (O.S.) FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to walk... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer. BRUCE He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park. ALFRED How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token. BRUCE I know another way in. (beat) Step on it. They're down there waiting for him. ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse... INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes, we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot intervals. He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel... ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with the suitcase who's invaded their domain. TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows. His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the park. INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of the bird's shrill voice to guide him: MYNAH AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME. TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE... VOICE STOP THERE. The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA. TIPTREE I've cooperated. I've done everything you said. PENGUIN Open the case. TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. PENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? TIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want. There's no need to -- PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go. TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily. TIPTREE My family. You won't -- PENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. TIPTREE We -- ?!? (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman. PENGUIN No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out. INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. CATWOMAN That idiot. Another six feet -- PENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought two ravens. We've got a complete set! CATWOMAN What?? PENGUIN Yeah! They're in the suitcase -- An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... CATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK watching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the scene of the melee... INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a hand: no mas... He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train passes -- -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN... A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated... CATWOMAN God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot? PENGUIN Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot. That was exhausting. CATWOMAN No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're not out of here yet. She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him... As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back -- past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF TUNNELS -- -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his gaze falls on DICK. He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL... INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT. The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City Hall was erected. He shouts up: PENGUIN LETS DO IT! INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony. Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families... The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust with a RAVEN. When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up: PENGUIN Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn. His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its recessed socket, in quick succession... INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing happens. CATWOMAN What happens now? PENGUIN I don't know. That's all...! He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING, flapping his arms like wings. PENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's a -- He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass case... The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into view... INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to get at the box. FRICK That's the treasure? CATWOMAN No. It's a map... She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER. INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him. He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps over to his side: PENGUIN Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this. It's right under Wayne Manor. It's been there all along! Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES -- an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION... PENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave. FADE THROUGH TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a yelp. VICKI No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings. VICKI (cont.) It's all right. You're safe. You can stay here as long as you need to. DICK I don't belong here. You can't keep me here. Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. VICKI It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer "Richard"? He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the breast. VICKI "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? DICK It's none of your business. What is this, some kind of home? VICKI No, not that kind. There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. DICK Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How the hell would you know what I want? VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- DICK I'm not staying. You can't make me -- -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. BRUCE I can make you. DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm in Batman's house. BRUCE (cont.) Come on. Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room. INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall. ALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? BRUCE I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about. ALFRED The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. BRUCE He hasn't got any parents. ALFRED How do you know that, sir? BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. BRUCE ...I know. The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the mouthpiece: ALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. SELINA Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still on for tonight? INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his look we DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. ALFRED Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is Christmas eve. BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. BRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. ALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. BRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to take her out tonight. INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird household he's landed in... INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand. BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly: SELINA You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite dressed. BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts. The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it, yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out. SELINA (cont.) If you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners. BRUCE Christmas eve. No tree? SELINA No presents. I've been a bad girl this year. BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby wet bar. BRUCE I'm surprised you kept this date. I thought you would've lost interest by now. SELINA What makes you say that? BRUCE You've got what you want, don't you? SELINA I do now. (smiling) We've had this date for a long, long time. With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny look. BRUCE How much is it going to cost me? SELINA What? BRUCE ...To get the ravens back. He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion. SELINA You're the oddest man I've ever met. (moving in on him) Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of a short fuse... BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way downward, kissing him around his neck and throat... HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it -- He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him... Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand. SELINA Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll start to enjoy it. BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen. SELINA (cont.) Bruce, you look faint. It must be the cats. BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem to work. SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form -- purring and stretching... BRUCE'S POV A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus. BRUCE What di-- what did you d-- She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright red. SELINA I guess I've...gotten under your skin. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG. He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually going slack. The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on schedule. INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's boys. ALFRED Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour. Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven o'clock. INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a window and throws the bundle outside. There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS. INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. PENGUIN Try his mag card. FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED CAPSULES. FRICK Look at this. He's a pillhead. Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. VICKI Ohh. Am I glad to -- To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. PENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. VICKI What did you do to him?? SELINA gives her a catty little smile. SELINA First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. PENGUIN You'd be the butler. Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. ALFRED Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ? PENGUIN You know how it is. Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. PENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? VICKI I don't know what you're talking about. PENGUIN The cave. Under the house. How do I get there? The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head. VICKI (cont.) I don't know! I swear, I would tell you -- PENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. ALFRED You're no more than a common thief. PENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- ALFRED I...don't...know... PENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he can speak -- SELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself. So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK. PENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. PENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of disgust. PENGUIN (cont.) I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think I'm...nouveau. ALFRED I think you're a dirty little man with a -- The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK reappear. PENGUIN See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. (smirking) I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money too -- when the statute of limitations runs out. SELINA (O.S.) Hey! -- Guess what I just found. Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of... SELINA (cont.) Christmas cookies! The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with limited enthusiasm. PENGUIN Let's spread out and see what we can find. (to FRICK and FRACK) You two -- keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to. FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE -- -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands STRUGGLING against his bonds. SERIES OF SHOTS QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out of frames, etc. Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on ALFRED and VICKI. INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and fumbles for the lock -- INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED... FRICK Better check it out. FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself. FRICK (cont.) What is it? What's going on?? VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a clear view of DICK and BRUCE. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds -- and SHOUTS: FRACK Some kind of security system -- INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and crumples in a heap. DICK Can you move, man? BRUCE Library -- got to get me to the library -- DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch the situation develop. INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway: PENGUIN What is that ungodly racket? FRACK A security alarm. It went off in the kitchen. PENGUIN My God! Is someone in here? He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are still poised in the doorway. It looks bad... INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat -- -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and vanish -- -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor. FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point- blank range. VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying. INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret switch. He's CRYING. BRUCE Alfred... DICK I'll go back. BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. VICKI SHUT UP. Help me with him. The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? FRICK Yes sir. PENGUIN Oh, good. That does relieve my mind -- He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face. PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. INSERT - MONITOR The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. PENGUIN Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly -- -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal. You know what to do. DICK nods yes and bolts off. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI! RUN! NOW! She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. DICK Here. You might need it. ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a dial tone -- VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other end, reeling her closer. SELINA You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch -- VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: CLANG. VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in the wood. VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose. INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI. SELINA I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off. VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA, who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up. INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her and LOCKING IT. SELINA HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty... She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there paralyzed as SELINA advances. SELINA So this is where you earn your keep. She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA kneels atop her... SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly section of bra -- SELINA Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham? She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK uncontrollably. SELINA Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep... She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the moonlit bed. SELINA tenses -- -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair -- BATMAN Miss me, "Angel"? He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges. INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself up. SELINA Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me... all the way this time. She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long stairway. She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner. BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN -- slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out cold. A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side -- VICKI Come on. We'll be safe in the cave. INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously... ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him. But then -- -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again. It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES, knocking over another -- and another -- -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering PENGUIN. SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA. SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around enough to dig himself out. INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open... INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to DICK: VICKI Come on. Come with us. DICK No. I can still help... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. WIPE TO: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: PENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move. I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. PENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to be stolen twice. ALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. PENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we? You go first. He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. SELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. BATMAN It's over. I don't want to hurt you any more. SELINA Tell me something -- one thing. If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good answer. She sighs. SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares up at him. BATMAN Nine lives. CATWOMAN I can't move. I can't move. Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still cautious... CATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want. Please? BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. BATMAN No. BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another gruesome WHINE. CATWOMAN COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch. You're all alike... Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to slit her own throat. He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. DICK You should've done it, man. You should've killed her. BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. BATMAN There's a radio in the cave. We'll send for help. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. PENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you now. Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a cautious step backward. CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks. PENGUIN No sudden moves. It's a long way down. Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto... HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down, above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them -- their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN... He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto... ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM. VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life. BATMAN VICKI! An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down across the rocks. With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her -- -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN. THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE RAILING. VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand. Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip. The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then -- BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares down at it, and two beats later -- -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there, PARALYZED. He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM -- -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether... BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace on the edge of the abyss. On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted, clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs, flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an ambulance. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g., a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound. GORDON ...and then Batman showed up? BRUCE He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders. GORDON God -- I pray you're right. (beat) One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the kid? BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are righting the fallen Christmas tree. BRUCE Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in town for the holidays. GORDON Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. (turning to go) Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up. GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR. BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front parlor. INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to BRUCE: VICKI What are you going to do with all that gold? BRUCE I dunno. Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one. She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve. VICKI It's Christmas. BRUCE Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your present. She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly. VICKI Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None of it matters. We're all safe. We're together. BRUCE ...You might as well. He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside. She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back. CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them; ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace. And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we FADE OUT. THE END

          An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall
          oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling
          metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that
          surely no one lives here.

          A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed
          on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a
          baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an
          unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of
          unmistakable wisdom.
                         
          Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen
          on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice.
          Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by
          DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention.

          Hushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife-
          beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature. She studies it,
          wonderful, is this the source of the thunder?
                         
          With the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly.
          We hear his HUGE BEATING HEART.

          A series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method. She
          chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a

          Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear. A TINY
          HEARTBEAT. She listens with focused wonder and intensity.
                         2
                         
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           All the time, everywhere,
           everything's organs be beatin' and
           squirtin' and talkin' to each other
           in ways I can't understand. Mosta
           the time they probably just sayin'
           "I'm hungry," or "I gotta poop,"
           but sometimes they talkin' in
           codes.
                         
           Hushpuppy's eyes dart up as a MAN'S VOICE yells-
                         
           MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           Get up, get out of here!
                         
           We hear a YOWL as a cat is flung across the room.
                         
           A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson
           Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris
           and discarded appliances.
                         
           A wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and
           brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This
           is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK (39).
                         
                          WINK
           Get your pants on, man!
                         
           Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into
           a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15
           feet down to the ground. The net is overflowing with beer
           cans.
                         
                         
           EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger
           and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder, up to the
           door of her house.
                         
                         
           EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
                         
           We now see Wink in his morning ritual. He opens a cooler
           with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the
           grill.
                         
           He goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food.
                         
           He pulls a clothesline that leads to Hushpuppy's trailer. A
           BELL RINGS.

                          WINK
           Feed up time! Feed up!
                         
           Hushpuppy, now wearing pants and a slightly more proper T-
           shirt, comes running down the oil barrels to her house. She
           echoes her Daddy.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Feed up time! Feed up!
                         
                         
           INT. ABANDONED BUS - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands,
           getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks
           really yummy.
                         
           Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around
           her.
                         
           A hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of
           the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws
           corn to the chickens.
                         
                          WINK
           Share with the dogs.
                         
           Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a
           filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body.
           This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a
           handsome young pup.
                         
                         
           EXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - THE TURCK - EVENING
                         
           WIDE, we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh.
           They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil
           drums. A motor is strapped to the back. A sign on the boat
           reads "The Turck", Hushpuppy's spelling of "Truck".
                         
           They look out to where the water goes all the way to a
           monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the
           distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction
           we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from
           rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall.
                         
           Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with
           a peaceful and confident disdain.
                         
           Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression.
                         4
                         
                         
                          WINK
           Ain't that ugly over there?
                         
           He takes a long pull on his beer.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           We live in the prettiest place on
           earth.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks over the wall to the Dry Side. It's an
           endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree
           or bird in sight. This is the engine that runs the Northern
           world.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Daddy says, up above the levee, on
           the dry side, they're afraid of the
           water like a bunch of babies. They
           built the wall that cuts us off.
                         
                         
           EXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY
                         
           We fly over marsh and water, coming upon a tiny crop of
           shanties on an island perched at the very bottom of the land.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           They think we all gonna drown down
           here. But we ain't goin' nowhere.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
           EXT. CAUSEWAY - PRE-FLOOD - DAY
                         
           CLOSE ON Hushpuppy letting out a WARRIOR SCREAM in a mass of
           HOLLERING people.
                         
           They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both
           sides by water. The rag tag band of revelers charge forward
           WHOOPING and SHOUTING.
                         
           Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. "Isle de
           Charles Doucet" is crossed out and someone has graffitied
           "The Bathtub." Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and
           smack in wild, ritualistic fashion.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           The Bathtub's got more holidays
           than the whole rest of the world.
                         5
                         
                         
           EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY
                         
           The townspeople charge in a rousing parade. Everyone drags
           trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to
           themselves that makes a lot of noise.
                         
           They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives,
           downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a
           community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon.
                         
           We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern
           society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class,
           race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place
           of true and honest unity.
                         
           Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun
           band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass
           players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck
           bounces them down a dirt road.
                         
           They drive under a banner reading "Welcome to the Bathtub
           Storm Season!"
                         
           Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the
           front end of a pickup truck. Over the front cabin rears a
           giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes,
           metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs
           clamber on top.
                         
           Wink hollers and waves to people. He fires jets of beer into
           the mouths of the crowd.
                         
           Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float. Though she's the
           tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the
           thick of everything. No one is checking I.Ds Here.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Daddy always saying, that up in the
           dry world, they got none of what we
           got.
                         
                         
           EXT. LAFOURCHE SQUARE - DAY
                         
           The town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods.
           Everyone is bouncing to the music, smiling and joking with
           one another.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           They only got holidays once a year.
                         6
                         
                         
           Six babies, each with a racing number pinned to their diaper,
           are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting-line on
           a track marked by two adjacent crowds of onlookers. Bets are
           flying between the spectators as if they're about to watch a
           cock-fight.
                         
           ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
           All babies to the race! Come up to
           the starting line! The baby race
           is about to begin.
                         
           Hushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd, swigging a bottle of
           something she probably shouldn't have.
                         
           A STARTING GUN fires, and the babies make a crawl for it.
           Most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment, but one
           brave soul toddles towards victory.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           They got fish stuck in plastic
           wrappers, they got their babies
           stuck in carriages, and chickens on
           sticks and all that kind of stuff.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks up at Wink who is dancing with his best
           friend WALRUS (60), a slack jawed, white haired, pinked
           nosed, handsome devil.
                         
           A baby crosses the finish line, ahead of the rest,
           victorious. The crowd goes wild.
                         
                         
           EXT. MARINA PAUPIER NET - NIGHT
                         
           Wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a
           picking pan. There's food to feed a hundred in the haul. No
           one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night
           fishing in the Bathtub.
                         
           Shrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one
           another for dear life.
                         
           Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch. Winks's hands move with
           virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp. She
           studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her
           Dad's proficiency. He doesn't demonstrate or explain
           anything, but we sense there is a system of education in
           place here.
                         7
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking
           it's last breaths of air.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           One day, the storm's gonna blow,
           the ground's gonna sink, and the
           water's gonna rise up so high,
           there ain't gonna be no Bathtub,
           just a whole bunch of water.
                         
           She pick up a crab, pets its belly. The DIN of the party
           fades down around her as she listens to its HEARTBEAT.
                         
                         
           EXT. LADY JO'S CYPRESS FOREST - NIGHT
                         
           Explosions everywhere as Bathtubers rampage blasting
           fireworks down the street instead of into the air. Men
           dressed as women, women dressed as men, in some kind of
           reckless esoteric ritual.
                         
           The SCORE kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding.
           We sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy, the unbridled
           joy, that a cloud hangs over this community. The people are
           parting like it's there last day on earth, and we feel
           viscerally, that it could be.
                         
           Hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind Wink waving a
           fountain sparkler. Wink trips and falls.
                         
           Wink lies on his back on the ground. He sees his daughter
           watching him, holding the huge sparkler, and they both laugh
           with sheer joy.
                         
           Hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his
           face, the fuse burning. He nods his approval. They watch
           the fuse burn down to the last moment. She turns it upward,
           and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming
           mortars.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Wink's faces.
           He's momentarily peaceful, admiring the spectacular display.
                         
           Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride. He doesn't see her.
                         
           They run off into the crowd, which is pulsating at the
           pinnacle of mayhem. The OMINOUS MUSIC shifts gears into a
           BLASTING PATRIOTIC HYMN of the Bathtub. Throw your fist in
           the air! These are the survivors, those who fight for their
           joy and their history to the last man.

           here. We who the earth is for.
                         
           Hushpuppy runs right at us with detonating fireworks in both
           hands, engulfed by light. She swings them toward camera and
           the screen is engulfed in an inferno of sparks. A white out.
           Black letters slam down.

           MUSIC CUTS abruptly as a basket of crawfish is slammed in
           front of camera. The crawfish squirming and struggling for
           life engulfs the screen.

           Meat.
                         
           A fearsome, uncompromising leader, sexy like a lady
           bullfighter, peeks at Hushpuppy over a mass of squirming
           crawfish. This is MISS BATHSHEBA (36).
                         
           She points to three students, pushing their heads with her
           finger, each time announcing:
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           MEAT. MEAT. MEAT.
                         
           The twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures
           caged in mason jars, basins, and boxes with breathing holes-
           her educational tools.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           Every animal is made out of meat.
           I am meat, ya'll asses meat.
           Everything is part of the buffet of
           the universe.
                         
           Miss Bathsheba rolls up the leg of her skirt.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           This here, is an Aurochs.
                         
           Riding her thigh, is tattooed a scene much like a cave
           painting in Lascaux. In thick black ink, it depicts a battle
           between early men wielding spears, and giant bull-like
           animals bearing down over them.
                         9
                         
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           A fierce, mean creature that roamed
           the earth back when we all lived in
           caves. They would gobble the cave-
           babies down right in front of their
           cave-parents. And the cavemen
           couldn't do nothing about it,
           because they were too poor, too
           stupid, too small. Who here thinks
           the Cavemen were sitting around
           crying like a buncha pussies?
                         
           Children stare blankly, no one raises their hand.
                         
           Hushpuppy watches a heroic crawfish crest the basket, fall to
           the floor, and make a run for it.
                         
           Miss Bathsheba snatches up the rogue crawdad and flings it
           back into the vat.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           Y'all better think about that.
           Cause any day now, the fabric of
           the universe is coming unraveled.
           The ice caps gonna melt, the
           water's gonna rise, and everything
           south of the levee's going under.
                         
           She points to a map showing a ragged coastline. On the wrong
           side of a giant line marked "levee" is an island labeled "The
           Bathtub."
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a
           whole bunch of water. Y'all better
           learn to survive.
                         
           A mysterious COLD WIND fills the air. Hushpuppy stares into
           a wall poster of an ice cliff reading: THE SOUTH POLE.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Way back in the day, the Aurochs
           was king of the world.
                         
                         
           EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY
                         
           CRASH CUT to the PANORAMA of an ice cliff, but now it's real.
                         10
                         
                         
           We CUT CLOSER to overwhelming white light accompanied by
           intermittent FROZEN CRACKS that build in frequency and
           volume.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           If it wasn't for giant snowballs,
           and the iced age. I wouldn't even
           be Hushpuppy, I would just be
           breakfast.
                         
           The light dims in intensity to reveal, frozen deep inside the
           ice wall, barely visible- a fanged, hairy, bloated, stone
           aged creature, the same as on Miss Bathsheba's leg. This is
           an Aurochs.
                         
                         
           INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - EVENING
                         
           Hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing, up to
           Wink's shanty in the trees. Windell, her dirty Chihuahua,
           follows behind.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up?
                         
           Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           Daddy?
                         
           Nothing.
                         
           She goes inside.
                         
           The house is empty.
                         
           She checks the Shacko for food. Nothing.
                         
                         
           EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - EVENING
                         
           Several hours later, Hushpuppy stands on a metal bin looking
           into the distance.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           DADDY!?
                         
           Like some sort of animal call, she SHRIEKS.
                         11
                         
                         
           INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress...
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy
           and nobody. They got to live in
           the woods, and eat grass, and steal
           underpants.
                         
           Hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink.
                         
                         
           EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING
                         
           Windell, the Chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet
           the day.
                         
           Hushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Daddy? Daddy?
                         
           No response.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           If Daddy don't get home soon, it's
           gonna be time for me to start
           eating my pets.
                         
                         
           EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY
                         
           Kids walk home with their parents after a day at the
           Schoolboat, which we now see is big a yellow houseboat
           floating on the bayou.
                         
           Hushpuppy waits alone, no one has come to get her.
                         
           Miss Bathsheba locks up the door and heads for her small
           motor boat tied off on the side of the school.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           You need a ride, boo?
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           My Daddy's coming to pick me up.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           How about food or something, you
           hungry?
                         12
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'.
                         
           Miss Bathsheba's doesn't totally believe her, but she's not
           the type to coddle either.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           Alright, well suit yourself.
                         
           Miss Bathsheba motors away.
                         
           Hushpuppy waits until she's out of sight and starts walking.
                         
                         
           INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING
                         
           Playing don't-touch-the-floor, Hushpuppy navigates her house.
                         
           The room has with holes in the walls blocked with old clothes
           and paper towels. Homemade toys fill every surface. This is
           the domain of a child at loose ends.
                         
           Hushpuppy leaps over her bed- a nook piled with clothes- and
           plugs in the Christmas lights.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O)
           Everything we still got from Mamma,
           we keep in my house.
                         
           We push in on a shrine to her mother:
                         
           A red basketball jersey. An apron. A sawed-off shotgun. A
           child's drawing of a beautiful lady.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Daddy says, the first time she
           looked at me, it made her heart
           beat so big, that she thought it
           would blow up. That's why she swam
           away.
                         
           Hushpuppy takes the jersey down. She puts it over a chair in
           the dining area.
                         
           Hushpuppy gets a can of cat food. A pot. Water in a bowl.
           Her actions have a sad sense of routine to them- she's been
           left alone before, and has her own self-invented system for
           feeding herself.
                         
           She opens a can of cat food, takes it out with her hand and
           throws it in a pot. She licks the remnants off her finger.
                         13
                         
                         
                          MARIETTA'S VOICE
           Hi my sweet baby.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Hi momma.
                         
           MARIETTA, Hushpuppy's imaginary, invisible mamma, is speaking
           from the basketball jersey chair. Marietta functions like an
           imaginary friend- Hushpuppy is the only one who can see her.
           Hushpuppy takes the pot, puts it on the stove.
                         
                          MARIETTA'S VOICE
           Hushpuppy what you doing there?
           You being good like I taught you?
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Yes, mamma.
                         
           Hushpuppy turns on the gas.
                         
           Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a
           helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it.
                         
           She aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a
           cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant. A spray of
           flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
           MOMENTS LATER. Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove. She ties
           on an apron and sways to the music. She is dressing like her
           mom.
                         
           Marietta's Voice sings to her.
                         
                          MARIETTA'S VOICE
           You're good, you make me happy /
           you're good, you make me happy.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           That's pretty Mamma.
                         
                          MARIETTA'S VOICE
           You're pretty Hushpuppy.
                         
           Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying
           in fat, which in her POV is a surreal churning vision, like
           the bubbling lava at the center of the earth.
                         
           She's SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being flung
           across the yard.

           WINK (O.S)
           Get out of my way you fat animal!
                         
           Hushpuppy jumps down from the stove, grabs a bowl of water,
           and runs to greet Wink,
                         
                         
           EXT. WINK'S COMPOUND - MORNING
                         
           She clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water
           everywhere in her excitement.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
                         
           Wink doesn't turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the
           field toward his Shacko. He's wearing a hospital patient's
           smock and no shoes, it seems he checked himself out.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           I learned lots of stuff while you
           gone. If I drink all this here I
           can burp like a man.
                         
           Hushpuppy gulps down water, all of it. Wink keeps walking.
           Hushpuppy BURPS like a man, but he doesn't turn around.
                         
           Hushpuppy stops to examine the situation. Something's not
           right here.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           How come you wearing a dress?
                         
           Hushpuppy tugs his patient's smock and he shrugs her off
           violently.
                         
                          WINK
           Leave me alone, Man.
                         
           She sees his hospital I.D bracelet still on.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           You wearing a bracelet too?
                         
                          WINK
           Go in your house, you wouldn't
           understand.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I wanna come in your house.
                         15
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy whacks Wink's butt.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           I WANNA COME IN YOUR HOUSE!
                         
           Wink fakes like he's gonna smack her.
                         
                          WINK
           GO AHEAD!
                         
           Hushpuppy tears off.
                         
           Wink storms into the Shacko in the Backo.
                         
                         
           INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy stomps inside. Her cat food is burning, with steam
           jetting up to the ceiling. She thinks about it for a moment,
           and turns the burner up. Smoke billows.
                         
           Hushpuppy grabs her basketball jersey off the chair and jumps
           over the breakfront counter. Behind her A MASSIVE GREASE
           EXPLOSION.
                         
           Hushpuppy ducks down, panicking. She check over the median.
           The stove is on engulfed in flames.
                         
           Hushpuppy scrambles under a cardboard box.
                         
                         
           INT./EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S BOX - DAY
                         
           The walls of the box are decorated with years of her
           drawings. In here she feels a strange safety. The FLAMES
           and BREAKING WINDOWS feel distant and muffled.
                         
           She draws a hieroglyphic of herself sad and crying on an
           island with a sun and a palm tree.
                         
           She peeks out as Wink runs into the house, which is filled
           with black smoke, flickering flames.
                         
           WINK (O.S.)
           (panicking from inside)
           Hushpuppy!? Boss lady!? Hushpuppy
           where you at!?
                         
           Hushpuppy drops the box closed. Smoke billows into the box,
           filling it up.
                         16
                         
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O)
           If Daddy kill me, I ain't gonna be
           forgotten, I'm recording my story
           for the scientists of the future.
                         
           Hushpuppy draws a bigger figure giving her a hug as Wink's
           panicked fury intensifies outside.
                         
           WINK (O.S)
           HUSHPUPPY!? Where are you Boss!?
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O)
           In a million years, when kids go to
           school, they gonna know that once
           there was Hushpuppy and she lived
           with her Daddy in the Bathtub.
                         
           Wink pulls Hushpuppy's drawings off the walls, he flings them
           out the door to safety.
                         
           Hushpuppy coughs.
                         
           Wink has heard. He looks toward the box.
                         
                          WINK
           BOSS LADY?
                         
           Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it, flying out the door.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Don't you run away from me. I
           swear to GOD Hushpuppy!
                         
                         
           EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy runs out of Wink's compound into the woods, Wink on
           her trail. In the background, the house is a towering
           inferno.
                         
                         
           EXT. TRAIL BEHIND WINK'S COMPOUND - DAY
                         
           They run deeper into the swamp.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I'm tearing off!
                         
                          WINK
           You ain't tearing off nothin', I'll
           bust your ass!
                         17
                         
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I'm tearing off just like my Momma.
                         
                          WINK
           Come on!
                         
           Wink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses.
           She digs her heels in.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           See what happens. See what happens
           to you!
                         
           Hushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on.
                         
           Wink slaps Hushpuppy and she falls face down.
                         
           He looks away, disgusted with himself.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           See what you making me do? You're
           killing me!
                         
           He reaches down and tries to pick her up.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Get up and now come on.
                         
           Hushpuppy jumps up on her own.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I hope you do die! And after you
           die, I come to your grave and eat
           birthday cake all by myself!
                         
           Hushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly EVERYTHING
           GOES QUIET, as if all the insects in the forest have hushed.
                         
           All at once, we hear--
                         
           A HUMAN HEART, beating until there is a SONIC BOOM, an
           earsplitting CRACK of glacial ice.
                         
           Hushpuppy turns toward the sound. When she turns back Wink's
           face has transformed, wrenches with fear and pain.
                         
           Wink keels over clutching his arm.
                         
           Hushpuppy stares, her breath accelerating.
                         
           Wink's eyes roll back in his head, he begins to seizure.
                         18
                         
                         
           ANOTHER GLACIAL CRACK rings out. The SPLITTING builds to a
           DEAFENING ROAR. She covers her ears.
                         
                         
           EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF / WOODS - DAY
                         
           Fissures appear like lightning through the massive ice cliff
           from the opening of the movie.
                         
           Hushpuppy runs from the sound, hands over her ears. We
           INTERCUT with shots of falling glaciers. The universe is
           coming unravelled.
                         
           An ice shelf COLLAPSES into the ocean in a MASSIVE AVALANCHE,
           a wave rolls toward camera.
                         
                         
           EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY
                         
           The wave, now just a tiny ripple, hits Hushpuppy's feet.
           Suddenly, the water level rises around her. It overtakes her
           knees and keeps going. Hushpuppy backs up to shore,
           terrified.
                         
           Hushpuppy calls out to a distant beacon flashing on the
           horizon.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Momma!? Momma!? MOMMA!? I think
           I broke something.
                         
                         
           EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy runs out of the woods toward school in a total
           panic.
                         
           In front of the school parents pile their children into a
           pickup trucks and vans.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Miss Bathsheba! Miss Bathsheba!
           My Daddy fell down!
                         
           Miss Bathsheba takes Hushpuppy's hands as she tries to catch
           her breath to speak. Clutched in her hand is the hospital
           bracelet that Wink had been wearing.
                         
           Bathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it,
           her eyes widen in recognition and alarm.
                         19
                         
                         
           INT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba frantically pull herbs and
           roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it
           into a large medicine jar.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           It's gonna be OK baby.
                         
           Bathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           Ok, Hushpuppy, here's what I need
           you to do. You take this medicine
           and run as fast as you can. Go!
                         
                         
           EXT. SWAMP CLEARING - DAY
                         
           We see glimpses of nature protecting itself from the
           impending disaster. Flowers curl up, insects horde food
           underground, RUSTLING sounds fill the air. Black birds, and
           bats, and all manner of flying creatures fill the sky.
           They're all getting the hell out of dodge.
                         
           Hushpuppy, quaking with fear, runs through a menacing swamp
           clutching her medicine jar. The rising winds swirl the marsh
           grass all around her.
                         
           Hushpuppy runs to the spot where Wink collapsed.
                         
           He's gone.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks around the swamp, unable to understand.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Daddy could have turned into a
           tree, or a bug. There wasn't any
           way to know.
                         
           Hushpuppy hides her medicine jar in her storage unit- a
           leather flap laid over the hollow of an oak tree. The hollow
           is filled with trinkets and objects she's collected over the
           years.
                         
           Hushpuppy flinches as a shrieking animal calls out.
                         
           She looks up to see a leaf covered in writhing caterpillars.
           One of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting for
           it's life.
                         20
                         
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           The whole universe depends on
           everything fitting together just
           right. If one piece busts, even
           the smallest piece, the entire
           universe will get busted.
                         
                         
           EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY
                         
           Blocks of glaciers roll out of the avalanche and away from
           Antarctica like floating ice cubes. Embedded in each cube,
           is an Aurochs.
                         
           A single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead
           Aurochs' eye stares right at us. Its jaw wide, its fangs
           bared, the ferocious beast appears to have fossilized mid-
           pounce. THUNDER BOOMS.
                         
           We drift upwards into the cloud cover. As we rise above the
           white canopy, the spiral of a hurricane forms.
                         
                         
           EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY
                         
           STRINGS SWELL under HOWLING WINDS. We follow behind a little
           boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people of
           the Bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation.
                         
                          BOY
           The storm's coming! The storm's
           coming!
                         
                         
           EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy sulks out of the woods, feeling sorry for herself.
           She looks up and freezes like she's seen a ghost.
                         
           Wink hobbles down the road, looking shell-shocked. The
           traffic on the road moves in one direction: out. Wink walks
           back into town in the opposite direction.
                         
           In Hushpuppy's POV Wink arrives at Lady Jo's bar where a band
           of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions. They
           are watching the evacuation go by like it's a Veteran's Day
           parade. They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out to a
           family making their way to safety.
                         21
                         
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           Look at these assholes running
           around all over the damn place.
           C'est la vie assholes!
                         
                          WINK
           I know y'all with me. Y'all doin'
           the storm.
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey.
                         
                          WINK
           That's what I'm talking about.
           Walrus my big man, you staying?
                         
                          WALRUS
           Wrong number buddy. I'm outta here
           as soon as I finish my beer.
                         
           Wink dismisses him with a wave of his hand.
                         
                          WINK
           You ain't goin nowhere.
                         
                          WALRUS
           This ain't no sneeze comin' out the
           gulf. I'm gone brother.
                         
                          WINK
           I'll see you tomorrow Walrus.
           Lookit there, Winston's with me.
                         
           WINSTON is passed out on the stairs.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           What you doing about the storm
           Winston?
                         
           Without opening his eyes, Winston raises an umbrella over his
           head. Wink laughs.
                         
                          WALRUS
           Hey! It's Hushpuppy.
                         
                          EVERYBODY
           Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy's here.
                         
           They burst into a round of drunken applause.
                         22
                         
                         
                          WINK
           Hushpuppy? Where you been?
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           What happened to y-
                         
                          WINK
           Shut-up!
                         
           He lifts her up by the britches and carries her away.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           You don't talk!
                         
                         
           INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - GROUND FLOOR - DAY
                         
           Through the bus window, Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for
           the storm as branches and debris fly by him. He RANTS to
           himself and drinks. He ties the Turck onto the house.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks to where her animals lurch and freeze, run
           around in circles, pant heavily. They feel it coming.
                         
           Rain drops start to spatter the window and Wink trips and
           falls trying to catch a fleeing chicken.
                         
                         
           INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHT
                         
           Now, the full force of the storm HOWLS and CLATTERS the
           shutters. Rain screams against the corrugated metal roof.
                         
           Wink tapes padding over all sharp corners and plastic wraps
           the furniture. He's Hushpuppy-proofing everything.
                         
           He runs a piece of duct tape across the floor.
                         
                          WINK
           This side is still Wink's house.
           No toys, and no girl stuff over
           here.
                         
           Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppy's house across the
           line.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           So if I want to come over that side
           and smack you in the face, that's
           against the rules. So there's a
           plus for you.
                         23
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Now come on down here and get in
           the boat, man.
                         
           He points to a trunk on the floor. Hushpuppy hops down and
           gets in. Wink sits on his air mattress.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           If the water get real high, we
           gonna float to the top and we gonna
           bust through the roof and we gonna
           ride away, okay?
                         
           Wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           You never NEVER take these off.
           I'm your Daddy, and you do what I
           tell you to do, because it's my job
           to keep you from dying, ok? So sit
           back and just listen to me...
           Close your eyes and go to sleep.
           CLOSE YOUR EYES!
                         
           Hushpuppy watches Wink pretending to sleep. The THUNDER
           scares the bejesus out of him again.
                         
           She looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in
           steadily.
                         
           Looks back at Wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor
           bottle. He resumes his phony sleep.
                         
           A strong gust of wind JOLTS the entire room and he springs
           out of bed.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Why you starin' at me like that? I
           can't sleep with you starin' at me
           like that.
                         
           Wink paces the floor.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Listen. You need to understand,
           you're a kid and I'm a man.
                         
           She doesn't understand.
                         24
                         
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           What, you scared?
                         
           Hushpuppy nods. THUNDER BOOMS and Wink is the one who
           flinches.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Don't be scared, no storm can't
           beat no Doucet. I'm gonna show
           you. You watch.
                         
           But he can see she's still scared.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           I'm'll show you! We Doucets we're
           not scared of no damn storm.
                         
           Wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch in
           the floor into the storm.
                         
           Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out.
                         
           OUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full
           sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off
           and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy!
           Watch me kick butt.
                         
           Wink fires his shotgun at the heavens.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm
           right here I ain't going nowhere.
           AHHHHHH!!!
                         
           A THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam
           CRASHES down.
                         
           Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe.
                         
           Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS,
           panicking herself.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Mamma!? MAMMA!?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         25
                         
                         
           EXT. PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT
                         
           Still in the rainstorm, a glacial cube SHATTERS, flopping a
           mammoth body onto the shoreline.
                         
           It's chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard. The animal
           begins to roll over.
                         
           Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself
           up. We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she
           stares into the distance.
                         
           The massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands
           of years of sleep.
                         
           She looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR.
                         
           We sit close on one of her black eyes. There is something
           dangerously sad in her cold gaze. Her head moves from the
           frame as she starts forward on her journey.
                         
                         
           EXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY
                         
           Silence. The storm has passed.
                         
           The camera flies high over the Bathtub. The tops of houses
           poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond.
                         
                         
           EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING
                         
           A slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water.
                         
           Something under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges a
           roof panel. The axe twists and leverages off the slab.
                         
           Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof. Then Windell.
           Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too.
                         
           The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new
           world.
                         
                         
           EXT. FLOODED LAFOURCHE ROAD - TURCK - MORNING
                         
           Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded
           landscape where their town had once been. Neither he nor
           Hushpuppy can say a word. Everything is submerged. Every
           organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming.
                         26
                         
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           For every animal that didn't have a
           Dad to put it in a boat, the end of
           the world already happened.
           They're all down below, trying to
           breathe through water.
                         
           They pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on
           stilts have water up to the porches. Trees are bashed
           through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed.
                         
                         
           EXT. WINSTON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - MORNING
                         
           Wink uses a pole to open a door.
                         
                          WINK
           Yo Winston?
                         
           No one answers. They push off.
                         
                         
           EXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - THE TURCK - DAY
                         
           Wink enters an intact house with water up to the porch.
                         
           WINK (O.S.)
           Edison? Ow-Wee!
                         
           Wink leans against the door frame. From his POV we see
           Hushpuppy on the Turck. She picks a leaf and eats it. Wink
           shakes his head in dismay, realizing all too clearly his girl
           is not ready for survival.
                         
                         
           EXT. SWAMP - THE TURCK - DAY
                         
           The Turck passes through a net of Spanish moss into the belly
           of a swamp.
                         
                          WINK
           Some day when I'm gone, you gonna
           be the last man in the bathtub.
           You have to learn how to feed your
           house.
                         
           Wink goes to the edge of the turck and sticks his hand in the
           water.
                         27
                         
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Now, stick your left hand in this
           water, stick it in there.
                         
           Hushpuppy puts her right hand in the water.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Ok, what you do is you hold your
           hand steady and you just wait for
           your fish to come. You gotta ball
           your fist up, this is your punching
           hand. Ball your fist up in case
           you have to whack it when they come
           up.
                         
           Wink pulls a Catfish out with his bare hand.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           WHOOOOO YEA! Whooo lord, look what
           we got. I gotcha. Say "I gotcha!"
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I gotcha!
                         
           Wink slams the fish down on the floor of the Turck and pins
           it.
                         
                          WINK
           Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold
           it down like this, and whack him
           good with your fist.
                         
           Wink pins the fish and punches it in the face.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Go ahead whack him! You whack him
           good. Hold him like that and whack
           him!
                         
           Hushpuppy pins the fish. She tries to whack it and it cuts
           her.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           OW!
                         
           She hides her cut hand from Wink.
                         
                          WINK
           You OK? That's all a part of it.
                         28
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy winces in pain.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           You wanna try it again?
                         
           Hushpuppy shakes her head no, trying not to cry.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Come on. One more time.
                         
                         
           INT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a
           tablecloth on it. She's drawing on the floor with charcoal.
                         
           Something alive hits the roof and scurries across. We hear
           the entire house MOAN, or was it a distant ROAR?
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Daddy?
                         
           Wink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we
           heard it, fills the room. Hushpuppy tries to shake him
           awake.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt.
                         
           On Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web
           of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins
           covering his entire heart.
                         
           Hushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror.
                         
                         
           EXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
           The beacon pulses on the distant horizon.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Mamma? Is that you?
                         
           The beacon does not respond.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           I've broken everything.
                         29
                         
                         
           EXT. DESERT - DAY
                         
           A cloud of dust circulates particles. The Haze is blinding.
           A distant RUMBLING grows.
                         
           Dark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Strong animals, they know when your
           hearts are weak. That makes them
           hungry and they start coming.
                         
           We see one at first, then more join rank around it. The
           Aurochs are charging in a pack. They are a biblical terror;
           the horsemen of the apocalypse.
                         
                         
           EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY
                         
           The turck moves through the cypress forest, signs are strewn
           everywhere pointing to Lady Jo's bar. It appears abandoned.
                         
           Suddenly, the door SQUEAKS open. Walrus winces at the
           sunlight and pops a beer.
                         
           He steps out the door and SPLASHES into the water.
                         
                          WALRUS
           Holy bowlegged Sarah!
                         
                          WINK
           Hey partner! Hey Walrus!
                         
           Wink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing
           drunkard.
                         
           They leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck.
                         
                          WALRUS
           (gauging his surroundings)
           I musta passed out.
                         
           Wink starts chuckling silently. His chuckle builds to a
           laugh.
                         
                         
           INT. LADY JO'S BAR - FLOODED - DAY
                         
           They enter the bar, empty bottles, half eaten crabs, and
           general party debris are littered everywhere.
                         30
                         
                         
           Little Jo is sprawled on the floor under a table. Is she
           dead or just wasted?
                         
                          WINK
           Little Jo!
                         
           She awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table.
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           Wink!?
                         
           Wink and Walrus run to help her up.
                         
           LITTLE JO (CONT'D)
                          (TO WALRUS)
           You don't touch me you filthy
           bastard!
                          (TO WINK)
           Wink, you get me.
                         
           They both lift her.
                         
           LITTLE JO (CONT'D)
           Goin' on all night `bout how
           tonight's the last night on earth
           we gotta make it count. Talkin'
           dirty right in front of Peter T.
                         
                          WALRUS
           Sorry Peter T.
                         
           Peter T enters from the Bathroom.
                         
                          WINK
           Peter T, my man! I knew you wasn't
           gonna leave me man!
                         
           Peter T speaks in his polite, level-headed, soft sweet voice.
                         
                          PETER T
           Oh no, oh no.
                         
                          WALRUS
           (re: Peter T)
           That is one classic dude right
           there.
                         
                          WINK
           Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you
           stayed man! RHHAAAA!
                         31
                         
                         
           Wink jiggles Peter T's ample belly. Peter T giggles with
           glee.
                         
           Wink puts one arm around Walrus and the other around Peter T.
           He smiles to Hushpuppy.
                         
           She laughs too, the first smile in quite some days.
                         
                         
           INT. LADY JO'S BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
           The Bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages.
           There is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober
           creature in the room by far.
                         
                          WALRUS
           If I had wings, I know I could have
           flown in that bad boy. But I would
           have probably bounced off a tree,
           or...
                         
           Hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells.
                         
                          WINK
           Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the
           story of your conception?
                         
           The bar crowd chuckles.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first
           met we was so shy, we used to sit
           around, and drink beer, and smile
           at each other. One day we was so
           shy we just napped...
                         
           Wink's voice FADES DOWN as Hushpuppy's fantasy takes over.
           She closes her eyes.
                         
                         
           EXT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
           Wink, younger and prettier, naps in an uncharacteristically
           colorful lawn chair.
                         
           A LOW, GURGLING GROWL wakes him up.
                         
           There in the yard, crawling slow and lazy, is a massive 15-
           foot alligator, breathing the heavy, slutty way alligators
           breathe.
                         32
                         
                         
           A topless woman steps in front. Sweat beading on her perfect
           shoulder blades, down her perfect, back ending in a pair of
           boys' underpants- just like Hushpuppy's.
                         
           Throughout Hushpuppy's vision, we never see Marietta's face,
           it's always covered, shot from the back, or out of frame.
                         
           Marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand, Terminator 2 style.
                         
           Lowers it on the gator...
                         
           BLAM. Wink sits up in SLOW MOTION- her panties, and her long
           naked legs are covered with gator blood.
                         
           She turns to Wink, her head ABOVE FRAME.
                         
           CLOSE UP on her eye. She winks.
                         
                         
           INT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
           We follow behind Marietta's supple curves as she walks into
           the kitchen. Her white slip is almost see through...almost.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Back when Daddy used to talk about
           Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty
           she never even had to turn on the
           stove.
                         
           She runs her fingers along the counter and the burners IGNITE
           one by one as she passes.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           She just walk into a room and water
           start to boil.
                         
           Water starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption.
                         
           Marietta reaches into the frigidaire, and pulls out two ice-
           cold beers.
                         
           Ice melts down the bottles.
                         
           She opens them on the counter, flawlessly.
                         
           She walks over to Wink. Stands there. A hot mess.
                         
           Wink's voice FADES UP.
                         33
                         
                         
           WINK (V.O.)
           Your Momma battered that gator up,
           and set it to fry.
                         
                          CUT TO:

           Wink tips his drink.
                         
                          WINK
           ...and Hushpuppy popped into the
           universe maybe four minutes later.
                         
           He empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           I got it under control.
                         
           Wink looks away, lost in his own fantasy.
                         
                         
           INT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
           Over Marietta's shoulder, beads of sweat form along the strap
           of her slip. Good Lord.
                         
           Wink looks, and meets her eyes. The gaze of a proud and
           smitten man.
                         
           Grits fall through the chimney vent, into the boiling water.
           Dancing like all the invisible particles of the universe.
                         
                         
           INT. LADY JO'S BAR - NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy stares hard, her face locked in pride and
           determination. Filling with all the strength and heroism of
           her long-lost mother. She's ready to snap into action.

           ENERGETIC MUSIC drops and we move in a semi-montage through
           Hushpuppy's search for survivors.
                         
           Hushpuppy rows the Turck through the flooded Bathtub by
           herself. In the distance she sees a lone horse. It stands
           on an tiny island of land, the last high ground in an endless
           stretch of water.
                         34
                         
                         
           The horse holds Hushpuppy's gaze. She hears it's strong,
           resilient HEARTBEAT. They are one and the same.

           Hushpuppy approaches Schoolboat, which has weathered the
           storm relatively intact.

           Miss Bathsheba!?
                         
                         
           INT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy opens the door.
                         
           We hear RUSTLING and WHISPERING inside school.
                         
           It's three little girls left behind in the storm. JOY
           STRONG, a tall, wild-haired leader; LIZARD, a tiny thing in a
           giant man's tee shirt, and T-LOU, the muscle of this girl
           gang, looking very meek in her desperate condition.
                         
           The girls are huddled against each other, terrified, hungry,
           and alone.
                         
                         
           EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY
                         
           Miss Bathsheba, shell-shocked but steadfast, steers the boat
           toward the bar, the four girls now safely in her care. From
           the inside we hear CAROUSING, TOASTING, and RAUCOUS CAJUN
           MUSIC.
                         
                         
           INT. LADY JO'S BAR - FLOODED - NIGHT
                         
           Wink pours a mountain of crab and shrimp at a great communal
           table, assembled from many different tables.
                         
                          WINK
           Come on lets go! Time to eat!
           Come on children, feed up time!
                         
           He sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table,
           where Joy, T-Lou, and Lizard dig in.
                         
           Wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics of
           the Bathtub.
                         35
                         
                         
           The room is a shrine of people's chairs, umbrellas, clothing.
           We're late in the game, and the party has descended into
           utter debauchery.
                         
           Jean raises a glass.
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           To the last of the food!
                         
                          WALRUS
           To the last of the water!
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           You ain't drinkin' no water.
                         
           Miss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           Yea, tastes like more, alright!
                         
           Hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of
           the table.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           For the ones we'd never find, we
           make a funeral the Bathtub way,
           with no crying allowed.
                         
           Drunken Wink is giving drunken Walrus a bath as he eats.
                         
                          WALRUS
           When the water goes down, I'm gonna
           French kiss the dirt!
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           Water's not goin' down man.
                         
                          WINK
           Nah, that's my beautiful place
           under there.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           Man you know they got plenty of
           salt coming into that water,
           everything beautiful is gone.
           Trees are gonna dies first, then
           the animals, then the fish.
                         
                          WINK
           I got it under control.
                         36
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy picks up a crab. She tries to pound it open, tries
           yanking on a leg. She can't shell it.
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           Come on Hushpuppy, come over here
           lemme show you how.
                         
           Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil.
                         
           JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D)
           Here baby. You hold like this,
           then you turn it over like that.
                         
           Hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration, but a
           bit tentative.
                         
           We see Wink look away from Walrus and Jo's bawdy humor
           extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy. His disdain is
           palpable for this froufrou shelling technique.
                         
           JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D)
           Don't be scared of it now. Now,
           you take this knife, and you pop
           this off.
                         
           Jean holds Hushpuppy's hand and guides a knife to open the
           belly of the crab.
                         
           JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D)
           Atta girl.
                         
                          WINK
           NO! Hushpuppy--
                         
           Wink POUNDS the table. And the party falls suddenly silent.
                         
           Wink pushes the utensil away. He grabs a crab, opens it in
           three virtuosic hand motions.
                         
           Grease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face
           of the crab clean. It is beautiful to watch.
                         
           He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Beast it!
                         
           Hushpuppy looks to Miss Bathsheba for guidance.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           You heard your Daddy. Beast it.
                         37
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might. She
           doesn't have the power.
                         
                          EVERYONE
                          (CLAPPING ALONG)
           BEAST IT! BEAST IT! BEAST IT!
                         
           The kids jump out from under the table and chant.
                         
           Hushpuppy is turning blue, her eyes bulge with effort...
                         
           CRACK!
                         
           Hushpuppy opens the crab claw and sucks down the meat.
                         
           Everyone goes wild with applause! The kids too!
                         
           Hushpuppy stands up, ascending to the top of the table. She
           lets loose a WARRIOR CRY and flexes her muscles, deadly
           triumphant.
                         
           Little Jo gets so excited she starts dancing on the table.
           She CACKLES and jitterbugs wildly.
                         
           Walrus gets up to join her. Jean gets up and dances too.
           All the kids get up.
                         
           Wink glows with pride. Miss Bathsheba smiles.
                         
                          WINK
           Yea! You see what kinda family we
           got?! We got feeling!
                         
                         
           EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - FLOODED - VARIOUS
                         
           A DRIVING SCORE kicks in as we MONTAGE through the
           transformation of the Schoolboat into a ramshackle Ark.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           It wasn't no time to sit around
           crying like a bunch of pussies.
                         
           The survivors whittle sticks into spears, bend metal debris
           into spikes.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           We was gonna build a camp right on
           top of the Bathtub.
                         38
                         
                         
           Jean Battiste, cackling wildly, hauls a thrashing goat onto a
           floating animal pen. Chicken coops, snake cages, a pig pen
           are stacking precariously.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           We got enough animals to eat until
           the water goes down.
                         
           Rafts are lashed to the sides of the school. Every floating
           structure left in town is hauled in and added to the Ark.
                         
           Peter T ties on a floating vegetable garden.
                         
           In WIDE we see what looks like a small village of floating
           structures forming.
                         
                         
           INT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY
                         
           Miss Bathsheba puts Lizard's head in her lap, Lizard is
           playing as if she's unconscious after hyperventilating.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           (teaching a lesson)
           Come here, like this.
                         
           She takes Hushpuppy's hand and places it on Lizard's chest.
           She moves her hand in a circular motion.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           Like this. Tee-Lou get some water.
                         
           Tee-Lou runs to get a handful of water.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           Quick little circles. Good for the
           heart. Joy Strong?
                         
           Joy turns her back. Miss Bathsheba shakes her head.
                         
           Tee-Lou returns and pours water on Lizard's head, cooling
           her.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           This is most important thing I can
           ever teach y'all. You got to take
           care of people that's smaller and
           sweeter than you are.
                         
           Hushpuppy registers this advice, takes it to heart. She rubs
           Lizard's chest with delicacy and affection.
                         39
                         
                         
           Lizard's breathing returns to normal, and she sits up
           peacefully. Hushpuppy is awestruck. Bathsheba gets to her
           feet.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           That's better.
                         
                         
           INT. SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy watches Wink sleeping. His breathing has gotten
           worse.
                         
           She tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it
           down on Wink, tucking him in just right.
                         
           A DISTANT RUMBLING is heard. Cutting off suddenly as we...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
           EXT. BRAZILIAN FAVELLAS - DAY
                         
           A quiet town, not unlike the Bathtub, but with tangled power-
           lines, electrical towers, and layered hills.
                         
           A stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the
           street, denting the silence.
                         
           Slowly, the peaceful morning transitions into MORE RUMBLING,
           a distant CRACK.
                         
           Suddenly the house in the foreground explodes to smithereens
           and the head of an Aurochs drives through it.
                         
           Without breaking step, Aurochs maraud the village, trampling
           it into oblivion. We settle close on an Aurochs eye,
           emotionless and relentless in its calm.
                         
                         
           EXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - TURCK - MORNING
                         
           Wink, Hushpuppy, and the Bathtub crew pole the Turck through
           a lake blanketed with carcasses, pushing through the dead
           fish, dead porpoises, dead alligator garfish like they were
           lily pads. There is no wind, only dense wet heat searing on
           the faces of the characters. The once green foliage has gone
           brown and thirsty.
                         40
                         
                         
           HUSHPUPPY V.O.
           Two weeks later, everything started
           to die.
                         
                          WINK
           (to the water)
           Come on fishes, where y'at?
                         
           Wink empties his net- nothing but a pile of carcasses. He
           tips it back into the water. Wink pulls himself to the edge
           and sticks his head under to look for fish.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first
           time. Wink looks ridiculous, a dead fish drifts off his
           head.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
                          (WHISPERING)
           You wanna leave the Bathtub,
           Walrus?
                         
                          WALRUS
                          (WITHOUT THOUGHT)
           Nah.
                         
           Wink pulls his head back up.
                         
                          WINK
           I heard that.
                         
           Hushpuppy fidgets guiltily.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Nobody's leaving the Bathtub! You
           don't know nothing!
                         
           Wink lowers his net back in the water.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
                          (TO WALRUS)
           This water gonna kill us here. We
           gotta do something `bout this. I
           ain't starvin' to death while them
           people go grocery shopping up
           there.
                         
                         
           INT. SCHOOLBOAT - FLOODED - MORNING
                         
           The kids sleep on Miss Bathsheba in a big pile on the floor.
                         41
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy wakes hearing SHIFTING and a SNAP behind her.
                         
           Peter T is uncapping a shotgun shell and pouring black powder
           into a small jar.
                         
           She looks out the window where Jean Battiste is unhooking a
           propane container from Miss Bathsheba's burner. He opens her
           chest freezer and hefts out a 12-foot garfish, dropping the
           container in the water.
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           Shit!
                         
           Wink sneaks up and whispers to Hushpuppy.
                         
                          WINK
           Boss, Daddy's gotta take care of
           something.
                         
           Hushpuppy is instantly concerned, she's heard this line
           before, and it always leads to trouble.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna fix everything back how
           it was.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Everything gonna go right back?
                         
                          WINK
           Hell yeah, we gonna win.
                         
           Wink pounds his chest in solidarity. Hushpuppy matches his
           pound, but without confidence.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Boss, anything go wrong, Walrus is
           Daddy.
                         
           Wink and Hushpuppy look Walrus-- the face of doddering
           drunken bewilderment. A goat licks him.
                         
           Hushpuppy is not comforted.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           You're gonna be the king of the
           Bathtub, I promise that.
                         
           Wink can see he's getting nowhere.
                         42
                         
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Just sit here I'll be right back.
                         
           The DOOR CLOSING wakes Miss Bathsheba up. She scans the
           room, noticing the three missing people.
                         
                          WALRUS
           (an unconvincing lie)
           I think they be gone. I-I really
           can't say where.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           Walrus, don't make me slap your
           ass! They go to the levee!?
                         
           Walrus is intimidated into silence.
                         
           MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
           You so much as piss on that wall,
           you know what them people gonna do?
           They gonna smoke us out and stick
           us in a damn shelter.
                         
           Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba go for her boat keys.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Daddy says, brave men don't run
           from their home.
                         
           Hushpuppy scurries out the side window, escaping outside
           before Miss Bathsheba sees her.
                         
                         
           EXT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP - DAY
                         
           Wink, Jean Battiste, and Peter T keep their heads above water
           as they float under the tarp behind the truck bed. Peter T
           is wearing a life jacket and still has his top hat on.
                         
                          WINK
                          (WHISPERING)
           Peter T, don't hold onto me, hold
           onto the boat. You gonna be fine.
                         
           Jean Battiste duct tapes fireworks around the bomb: a propane
           tank with an igniter made from a battery and a pouch of black
           powder.
                         
           He inserts the bomb into the stomach cavity of a giant
           garfish carcass.
                         43
                         
                         
           Wink shoves two propane tanks inside the belly of the
           garfish.
                         
           He hands a rope attached to the igniter to Peter T.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Peter T, you hold the trip-line.
                         
                          PETER T
           (Soft and sweet)
           Ok then.
                         
                          WINK
           Just don't pull `til I say.
                         
                          PETER T
           Ok then.
                         
                          WINK
           You can do it. I have complete
           faith in you.
                         
                          PETER T
           Ok.
                         
           Jean Battiste is hesitant.
                         
           Wink gives Jean Battiste a confident nod.
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           Lock and load.
                         
           Jean Battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the
           fuse. He shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish.
                         
                         
           EXT. LEVEE WALL, IN THE WATER - DAY
                         
           The Turck pulls into an enclosed segment of the levee, Wink
           bobs out from under the Turck and latches a pre-made tether
           running out of the garfish to a handle on the wall. He bobs
           back under the boat.
                         
                         
           EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy dives under the fishing net on a motor boat just
           before Miss Bathsheba charges outside and keys the ignition.
                         
           Hushpuppy peeks out and the boat roars to life and rips
           across the water.
                         44
                         
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           The entire universe depends on
           everything fitting together just
           right. If you can fix the broken
           piece, it can all go right back.
                         
                         
           INT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP/SANTA MARIA - DAY
                         
                          WINK
           Peter T hand me the-
                         
           He looks, Peter T has both hands on the Turck.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Peter you didn't drop the trip-
           line?
                         
                          PETER T
           No I did not.
                         
           Peter T thinks a moment.
                         
           PETER T (CONT'D)
           Oh, yes I did.
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           Oh, Peter T.
                         
                          PETER T
           I'm sorry.
                         
           Wink dunks under water.
                         
                         
           EXT. LEVEE - DAY
                         
           Wink surfaces in front of the igniter rope.
                         
           As he grabs the rope, Bathsheba's snake catcher snares his
           hand and pulls his arm against the side of her Jon boat.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           Here's how we do with wild animals.
                         
                          WINK
           AHH! Get off me woman! I'm trying
           to save the Bathtub
                         
           Hushpuppy watches the struggle in hiding.
                         45
                         
                         
           Bathsheba wrenches the rope out of Wink's hand and chucks it.
                         
           The igniter rope lands in front of Hushpuppy under the net
           pile. She grabs it. She reels it in.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           Get in the Boat! I'm hauling
           you're ass back home, little boy.
                         
           Jean Battiste swims out of hiding.
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           Wink!?
                         
                          WINK
           Jean Battiste, get the trip line!
                         
           Suddenly, Hushpuppy pops out from under the nets, holding the
           rope taught. She stumbles and almost sets if off by
           accident.
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           Hushpuppy!?
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           She got it! Pull! Pull!
                         
                          WINK
           NOW BOSS!
                         
                          MISS BATHSHEBA
           No! Hushpuppy!
                         
           Hushpuppy, contemplates in an eerie peace.
                         
           The screaming chorus FADES and she is alone in her quiet,
           eyes darting between Bathsheba and Wink. Courage and
           certainly clench inside her her. You listen to your Daddy.
           She pulls the rope.
                         
                         
           EXT. LEVEE WALL IN THE WATER - DAY
                         
           The trip-line releases the detonator.
                         
                         
           EXT. LEVEE - NORTH SIDE - DAY
                         
           The levee DETONATES. Shattered wood and cement fire towards
           camera.
                         46
                         
                         
           Debris propels Hushpuppy backwards.
                         
           Her quiet resumes as she lands on the deck of the boat in
           slow motion. She watches in a daze as smoke, water, and
           flaming dust cycles above her. All the beauty of the
           universe.
                         
                         
           EXT. FLOODPLAIN - THE BATHTUB - DAY
                         
           Water recedes in the Bathtub, revealing the tragic, mud-
           soaked remnants of their paradise.
                         
           Hushpuppy slogs through the muck, each step going two feet
           down into the stinking filth.
                         
           The crew trudges behind her in silence.
                         
                         
           EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY
                         
           The blow-up crew crests a hill and sees the remains of the
           ark sprawled across an open field.
                         
           Wink's and Hushpuppy's eyes well up as they beholds the state
           of their island. The water has drained. Everything is dead.
                         
           More striking than the ripped-up houses, the land surrounding
           the island has disappeared. Trees are gone. Shards of marsh
           that had been attached float in the distance. What was a
           dense, green landscape is barren. The Bathtub is a scorched
           hell.
                         
                         
           EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - EVENING
                         
           Hushpuppy picks through the rubble of the Shacko in the
           Backo. She finds their grill, and a window made from a dryer
           door and brings them to Wink.
                         
           The Shacko has crash landed under the stilts of a house
           that's been entirely washed away. Wink has done some work
           reassembling the walls and broken parts into a semi-
           functional enclosure.
                         
                         
           EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy find nails and brings them to Wink, who leans wall
           panels against the stilts from the previous house.
                         47
                         
                         
           He hammers nails wearily. His strength is sapped. He HACKS
           out bile.

           It didn't matter that the water was
           gone. Sometimes, you can break
           something so bad, that it can't get
           put back together.
                         
                         
           INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - EVENING
                         
           Hushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to
           the top of the Shacko.
                         
           She looks down through the hole in the floor.
                         
           In her POV Wink climbs into bed, he painfully takes his shirt
           off. The bruise on his chest has extended all the way across
           his stomach.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that
           Marietta's still with her. The light shining on the water is
           off. She sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Mamma!?
                         
           Nothing.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           Mamma where you at!?
                         
           As if in response, we hear a HELICOPTER LOUDSPEAKER.
                         
                          PILOT

           Everyone in this area, has to

           EXT. DEAD FOREST - MORNING
                         
           Hushpuppy wades through the muck in what used to be a lush
           forest, now reduced to toothpick trees and mud.
                         
           She finds her storage unit in the tree hollow, and lifts out
           the medicine jar.

           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           When you're small, you gotta fix
           what you can.
                         
                         
           INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - NIGHT
                         
           She pours the crushed up roots into Wink's mouth, careful not
           to disturb him. Wink dooesn't move.
                         
           Hushpuppy gently folds in the orange fungus. Quiet, quiet--
                         
                          WINK
           GUUAAAHH!
                         
           Wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           God damn!
                         
           Wink grabs her medicine jar and threatens her with it.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           What you doing!?
                         
           He smashes it against the wall.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           What the hell's wrong with you!
                         
           Hushpuppy is so upset she doesn't know what to do. She
           screams in anger.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Raaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!
                         
           Raging, Hushpuppy breaks everything she can get her hands on,
           ruining everything Wink's reassembled, tipping shelves, pans,
           walls. She grabs a fishing pole and starts bashing Wink's
           grill over and over.
                         
                          WINK
           You wanna throw things? Come on!
           I can do that too. You want to
           play that game? Let's throw stuff!
                         
           Wink joins in, breaking stuff too, channeling all his anger
           into the destruction.
                         
           Wink throws himself into the wall. It breaks off and dumps a
           series of shelves all over the floor.
                         49
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy can't believe it.
                         
           Suddenly it's cathartic, they start throwing objects at each
           other and laughing.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Come on! Come on!
                         
           Wink pegs her in the face with a stuffed animal and she
           grins.
                         
           Hushpuppy throws a pillow!
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           AAAAH!!! COME ON! COME ON!
                         
           Hushpuppy throws a shoe.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           AAAAAHHHHH!!!!! YEAH!! COME ON!
                         
           Hushpuppy and Wink destroy everything in the house.
                         
           Something goes off in Wink chest. He grabs his heart and
           collapses on the floor.
                         
           Hushpuppy realizes something's not right. She throws a life-
           jacket at her father.
                         
           Wink continues to force a smile at her. Hushpuppy won't
           return the smile.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Man. You think I don't know.
                         
           Hushpuppy's bottom lip starts quivering.
                         
           Wink's smiles disappears.
                         
                          WINK
           Hey. No crying. Don't you cry
           man. Don't you cry!
                         
           He threatens her with a shoe. Hushpuppy hides behind an
           overturned chest.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           HEY! Don't cry damn it!
                         
           Wink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall.
                         50
                         
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Shit.
                         
           He pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine.
                         
           He sets up two cups on the table.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Come on get a drink.
                         
           Wink pours Hushpuppy a shot.
                         
           Hushpuppy sips. Winces. Looks suspiciously at her father.
           Sips again.
                         
           Wink takes one straight from the bottle.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           This counts as I'm sorry for a
           whole buncha things. Lord.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           You gonna be gone?
                         
                          WINK
           What? No!
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           You gonna leave me alone?
                         
                          WINK
           I ain't gon' leave nothing.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Cause if you be gone, I be gone
           too.
                         
                          WINK
           Hushpuppy, that is not how it
           works.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I will. Sometimes in the bed I
           start shaking and can't stop. I
           got what you got.
                         
                          WINK
           No man. That's just a side effect
           of being a stupid little girl.
                         51
                         
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I ain't gonna be dead?
                         
                          WINK
           No. You? No! You gonna live a
           hundred years more. You know what,
           show me the guns.
                         
           Hushpuppy shoves Wink.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Show me them guns man.
                         
           Wink clears everything off the table with one sweep.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Show me the guns! Guns! guns! guns!
           guns! guns!
                         
           Hushpuppy flexes her biceps. She begins to chant, fierce and
                          TRIUMPHANT--
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Guns! Guns! Guns! Guns!.....
                         
                          WINK
                          (OVERLAPPING)
           Guns man, give to me! Guns! Guns!
                         
           Wink holds up his hand to arm-wrestle. They SCREAM in tandem
           as Hushpuppy pins him hard.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Ooooo, Hushpuppy you the man. Who
           the man?
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I'm the man.
                         
                          WINK
           Who the man!?
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I'm the man!
                         
                          WINK
           TELL ME LOUDER WHO THE MAN!!!!
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I'm THE MAN!!!!!!!
                         52
                         
                         
                          WINK
           YOU THE MAN, RIGHT?!
                         
           Wink is overcome with love. It's too much for him to bear.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Fuck this table!
                         
           In a violent euphoria, Wink grabs the table and hurls it
           across the room.
                         
           This scares Hushpuppy. She stares silently at her wild
           animal father, longing for something more than rage.
                         
           Wink takes a step toward like he's going to comfort her, then
           stops, turning back.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           I gotta lay down hear? I gotta be
           strong. Don't be scared.
                         
           Wink lays down in the corner.
                         
           Hushpuppy doesn't go to bed, she just stands there.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
           Hushpuppy waits, not backing down.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)

           Come here.
                         
           Hushpuppy goes to Wink.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Lay down.
                         
           Wink pats his heart for her to put her head down on it.
                         
           A long beat.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           Hey.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Yea?
                         
                          WINK
           You ain't the one who's sick.
                         53
                         
                         
           She listens to his BIG HUGE HEART.
                         
                         
           EXT. WET SAND MUCK EXPANSE - DAY
                         
           The Aurochs move into a desolate, barren, wasteland, looking
           exhausted and starved.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Strong animals got no mercy.
                         
           Cold wind blows them backwards. An old Aurochs falls behind
           the pack. Its legs give out and it lays down. It's not going
           to make it.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)

                          CUT TO:
                         
           The Aurochs cannibalize their fallen comrade, ripping skin
           and organs in a storm of flesh and gore.
                         
           The CRIES of the screaming mother melt together with another,
           sound, more MECHANICAL...
                         
                         
           INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - MORNING
                         
           The SOUND becomes recognizable as a HELICOPTER PROPELLER.
                         
           Hushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm.
           Through the wall she sees FOUR WELL-DRESSED men. They are
           out of place like aliens exiting their space ship.
                         
           She rouses Wink, he hears the FOREIGN SOUNDING VOICES and
           yanks Hushpuppy up. He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy
           behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to
           defend them with.
                         
           EVACUATOR (O.S.)
           (from outside the door)
           This is a mandatory evacuation
           area. Everyone in this region has
           to leave.
                         
           Wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to
           enter.
                         54
                         
                         
                          WINK
           We ain't going nowhere!
                         
           Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff.
                         
                         
           INT. LADY JO'S HOUSE - POST FLOOD - MORNING
                         
           Three evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house.
                         
           Little Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife
           and civil war era pistol.
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           You gonna have to shoot me cause
           I'm not going.
                         
                          EVACUATOR 2
           Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you.
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           I ain't never left here and I won't
           never will.
                         
           She spits. They get closer.
                         
           LITTLE JO (CONT'D)
           Son, don't make me cancel your
           birth certificate.
                         
           The Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam
           her to the ground. It's horrible.
                         
                          EVACUATOR 2
           Relax, relax ma'am.
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           YOU SON OF A BITCH!
                         
           They drag Little Jo out of the house.

                          WINK
           Get your hands off of her! I'm
           gonna kill you! Let her go!

           EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - DAY
                         
           CRASH CUT TO an off-white monolithic community center
           surrounded by a cement parking lot. Stressed, amateur
           looking doctors from the real world move in and out of the
           glass doors.
                         
           A makeshift sign reads "Open Arms Processing Center."
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY
                         
           The interior of the refugee camp is violently, fluorescent-
           lit and painted white in an attempt to maintain a facade of
           sterility.
                         
           Hushpuppy stares at the strange and modern ceiling like
           they've descended from another planet.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           It didn't look like a prison, it
           looked like a fish tank with no
           water.
                         
           The Bathtub residents walk through the gymnasium which has
           been converted into a holding tank/hospital for refugees.
           Student doctors are examining, treating, feeding people. The
           abandoned souls, the sick, and the old are lined up waiting
           for assistance.
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - KITCHEN - DAY
                         
           A processed egg patty jiggles weirdly as it hits Hushpuppy's
           tray.
                         
                          WINK
           Don't eat that.
                         
           DR. MALONEY, a clean-cut, over-extended handsome young doctor
           hustles toward the lunch line.
                         
           DR. MALONEY
           Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with
           you, we found something in your
           test. It's-
                         
                          WINK
           Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my
           kid. Stay, Hushpuppy.
                         56
                         
                         
           Wink pulls Maloney out of earshot.
                         
           DR. MALONEY
           Mr. Doucet, there's no easy way to
           say this...
                         
           Hushpuppy struggles to hear more, only a couple words come
           through the din of refugees.
                         
           DR. MALONEY (CONT'D)
           ...require surgery
           immediately...you need to think
           about what you want for your
           daughter...you could die.
                         
           In Hushpuppy's POV: Maloney puts a sympathetic hand on Wink's
           shoulder and Wink pushes it off violently. Maloney puts up
           his hands in peace and Wink shoves him through one of the
           curtains and is assaulted by a flood of orderlies.
                         
                          WINK
           I don't need nothing from you! You
           keep your hands off her! I don't
           need nothing from y'all! Let me
           go!
                         
           Hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Daddy!
                         
           They tackle Wink to the ground. He goes limp as he falls.
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY
                         
           We TRACK with Wink as he comes to consciousness rolling
           through the cots. He is sedated and being pushed in a
           wheelchair.
                         
           He looks through an open door.
                         
           In Wink's POV- Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and the rest of
           Bathsheba's original school class play in a room with a
           BABYSITTER.
                         
           She tickles Hushpuppy, who has been given new clothes and
           looks like a normal little girl for the first time. Her
           boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate
           blue dress. The image is jarring.
                         57
                         
                         
                          BABYSITTER
           Hushpuppy needs a hug.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I don't want your hug!
                         
           The Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tries to squirm
           away.
                         
                          BABYSITTER
           Hushpuppy, that's not how nice
           girls act. Say "I'm sorry ma'am."
           Hey! Say it. Say it or you're
           going to corner time.
                         
           Hushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his
           horrifying appearance.
                         
           Wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls
           by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to
           scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth.
           He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm.
                         
                          ORDERLY
           (gently moving Wink's hand
                          AWAY)
           There there, sir.
                         
           Hushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away.
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber
           glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar; it looks
           infected and mishandled.
                         
           The same hand puts pills in Wink's mouth.
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator.
           She's creeps closer, examining him. She puts her head on his
           chest. His heart is beating.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           When an animal gets sick here, they
           plug it into the wall.
                         
           She whispers in his ear.
                         58
                         
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           They're coming for you.

           She repeats the process with another vegetable.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Daddy says, if he ever got so old
           he couldn't drink beer, or catch
           catfish, that I had to put him in a
           boat, and set him on fire, so no
           one could come plug him into the
           wall.
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy peeks through the curtains at another terminal bed.
                         
           She sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth. He's
           regaining his strength and is able to hold them off
           momentarily before submitting, and going limp.
                         
           Hushpuppy bolts, unable to take it.
                         
           We stay in the room as the orderlies walk away.
                         
           Wink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on
           the floor.
                         
           Wink stares at the ceiling for a long beat. Then, with a
           burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples
           himself onto the floor. He pulls his wires out.
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - KID'S ROOM - MORNING
                         
           Hushpuppy lies asleep in a pile with Tee-Lou, Lizard, and
           Joy. Wink enters and jostles her awake.
                         
                          WINK
           Boss. Let's go.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Where we goin'?
                         59

           Wink and the girls hustle to the entrance of the Refugee
           center.
                         
           Walrus comes running down the hall, pushing Peter T on a
           gurney.
                         
           Wink looks bewildered, the rest of the team seems to have
           their own plan afoot.
                         
                         
           INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - MORNING
                         
           Jean Battiste and Little Jo charge through the cots riling
           refugees into revolt as the orderlies chase them trying to
           maintain decorum.
                         
                          JEAN BATTISTE
           Go home! Everybody get up! Don't
           you want to go home? Lets go!
           These people don't care about you!
                         
           Little Jo fights off an orderly with a syringe.
                         
                          LITTLE JO
           You live in this hell hole!
                         
                         
           INT/EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - EVACUATION BUS - DAY
                         
           Wink runs the kids toward the bus, they pass two busses
           labeled for Salt Lake City, Des Moines.
                         
           Wink helps Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard get on. Then Hushpuppy.
                         
           Suddenly Wink's hand slips out of Hushpuppy's. He steps away
           from the evacuating bus. Hushpuppy turns and the bus door
           slams between them.
                         
                          WINK
           (from outside the door)
           Make sure you put her somewhere
           good ok? 
                         
           Wink sags. He's giving her away. He turns to leave..
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           (banging on the door)
           NO! I ain't running! No!
                         60
                         
                         
           Wink walks away from the bus, his chest heaving, his face
           clutched in the horror of what he's done.
                         
           Behind him, the bus pulls forward, then veers violently.
                         
           Hushpuppy charges the driver clawing at her face, punching
           and kicking.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           Let me go!
                         
           The driver pulls the break and Hushpuppy bangs the doors
           open.
                         
           She charges Wink from behind, gives him a diving shove.
                         
           He topples over.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           You trying to get rid of me! You
           trying to get rid of me!
                         
                          WINK
           No!
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Why you trying to get rid of me?
                         
                          WINK
           I ain't trying to get rid of you.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           You is.
                         
                          WINK
           No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care
           of you no more.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Yes you can.
                         
           Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing.
                         
                          WINK
           Daddy's dying!
                         
           Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           My blood is eating itself. You
           know what that means?
                         61
                         
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Don't be sayin' about dying.
                         
                          WINK
           Everybody's Daddy dies.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Not my Daddy.
                         
                          WINK
           Yes, your Daddy!
                         
           Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in.
           It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)
           I didn't want you to watch that,
           ok? You understand?
                         
           Wink doubles over hacking. He COUGHS horribly.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass,
           dripping from his mouth.
                         
           The Bathtub gangs charges out the door!
                         
           Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming
           to a halt around Wink.
                         
           Hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking
           lot.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Come on! Come on!
                         
           Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him.
                         
                          WINK
           Walrus, get me home.
                         
                         
           EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY
                         
           The Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town.
           His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able
           to help walk.
                         
           We sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been
           a long journey home.
                         62
                         
                         
           INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
                         
           They drag Wink through the Shacko entrance.
                         
           Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door
           as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to
           watch.
                         
           Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood
           bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then
           looks away as fast as he can.
                         
           Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door.
                         
                         
           EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy walks down the road in an almost eerie state of
           calm. She takes in the remnants of rusting houses and
           flipped boats, her lifeless ghost town.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           Everybody looses the thing that
           made them, it's even how it's
           supposed to be in nature.
                         
                         
           EXT. LAVA RIDGE - DAY
                         
           Now with her three friends, she tip-toes past several
           humongous footprints up to a gruesome fox carcass. Something
           gigantic has ripped open its stomach and gutted it.
                         
           She leans over, unafraid, trying to understand it's meaning.
           Flies swarm and nibble, their movement almost elegant. Seen
           in close up, the gory mess has a strange beauty to it.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           The brave men stay and watch it
           happen. They don't run.
                         
           A SONIC BOOM springs her upright, she looks around for the
           source of the sound. Is it an Aurochs?
                         
           She looks towards the muddy bayou. The SONIC BOOM sounds
           again and the entire body of water quivers with the impact.
                         
                         
           EXT. DARDAR RIDGE - EVENING
                         
           The beacon blinks out on the water.
                         63
                         
                         
           Hushpuppy stares towards it. The children are gathered
           behind her.
                         
           Something has changed in her eyes. The eerie calm has given
           way to a hardened determination. Though unclear to us, her
           internal path of action is certain.
                         
           She takes a deep breath, and lets out a WARRIOR CRY. She
           runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging
           behind her.
                         
                         
           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - EVENING
                         
           Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Hushpuppy swim through open water,
           pulling each other forward. They head in the direction of
           the beacon.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Come on! Keep going!
                         
           They try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere,
           the current pulls them backwards.
                         
           We hear a BOAT HORN and they look to where an ANCIENT TUG
           BOAT with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe
           head, appears through the mist.
                         
                         
           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING
                         
           The girls climb aboard, lifting each other onto the deck.
                         
           They look up to the sound of FOOTSTEPS on the upper deck.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR (60) -
                         
           A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache,
           saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these
           runts with an air of suspicion.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I'm going by my Mamma.
                         
           He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him
           and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is
           understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness.
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           That's a good place to go.
                         64
                         
                         
           EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING
                         
           Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated
           wheelhouse. They are two stories up, and the white walls
           create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another
           dimension.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Which way are we going?
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Don't matter baby, this boat'll
           take you exactly where you need to
           be. It's just that type of boat.
                         
           Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else
           we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old
           teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences
           last.
                         
           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)
           You want a chicken biscuit?
                         
           Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'.
                         
           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)
           They're good for you.
                         
           A deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on
           a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The
           wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers.
                         
           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)
           I been eating these all my life. I
           keep the wrappers in the boat,
           `cause they remind me who I was
           when I ate each one. The smell
           make me feel cohesive.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I wanna be cohesive. 
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Oh you will be, I got no doubt in
           my mind.
                         
           They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel
           chair back toward the water
                         65
                         
                         
           The beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go
           wide.
                         
           As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half-
           sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the
           same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up
           sign: "Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS
           GIRLS."
                         
                         
           EXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING
                         
           Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge
           with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a
           hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away
           JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to
           each other in wonder.
                         
                         
           INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
                         
           Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland.
           Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke
           facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at
           a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans
           Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their
           ladies of the night.
                         
           There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along
           with "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Fats Waller.
                         
           The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this
           establishment, comes a'hoppin'.
                         
                          MISS FRANKIE
           Holy crap you have toddlers!
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.
                         
                          MISS FRANKIE
           Well butter my butt and call me a
           biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major?
           You need some grits?
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Yes ma'am.
                         66
                         
                         
                          MISS FRANKIE
           Holy Sugar, they are so precious!
           Y'all just as cute as a tub of
           puppies!
                         
           Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do
           with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists.
                         
           Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry
           of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They
           are not who she is looking for.
                         
           She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up
           all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it,
           none of them right.
                         
           Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes,
           ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious
           dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed.
                         
           She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen.
                         
           Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven.
                         
           SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the
           swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles.
           It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where
           a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the
           swinging doors. They open.
                         
           Hushpuppy holds her breath.
                         
           A gorgeous COOK (35) wearing a baseball cap and an apron
           comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her
           brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold
           beer.
                         
           The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.
                         
                          COOK
           You need something baby?
                         
           Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           Well whatchu want? You alone?
                         
           Hushpuppy shrugs.
                         
           She's too stunned, too shy to speak.
                         67
                         
                         
           The Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of
           her. Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy,
           she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           Get in here, I'm'll show you a
           magic trick.
                         
           Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her
           head against the swinging doors on her way in.
                         
                         
           INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - KITCHEN
                         
           With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts
           an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth, SPITS the cap at
           the egg and it cracks over the grits.
                         
           Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure. She watches the
           Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single
           motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail
           on the table and begins sawing through the scales.
                         
                          COOK
           Lemme tell you somethin', when
           you're a child people tell you that
           everything's gonna be all hunky-
           dory and all that bullshit, but I'm
           here to tell you that it's not. So
           get that out your head right now.
                         
           She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy
           like its a pointer.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           Life's some big old feast, yeah,
           but you? You ain't nothin' but a
           stupid little waitress.
                         
           She scales a gator, strips the bones, dredges, fries.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           Everything you got on your platter
           gonna fall on the floor and ain't
           nobody gonna be there to pick it up
           for you. Someday it's all gonna be
           on you.
                         68
                         
                         
           She stirs the grits. Grits on plate. Gator on plate. Plate
           in front of Hushpuppy. Lemon is squeezed all over
           everything.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           So smile, girl.
                         
           Hushpuppy tries to crack a grin. She barely remembers how to
           smile and it comes out all wrong. The Cook shakes her head,
           opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           Nobody likes a pity-party-having-
           ass-woman.
                         
           Hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of
           dust in the incandescent light-- stars of the universe. The
           golden bubbling fry pot-- lava of the molten core.

           Four perfect gator nuggets are placed next to a sumptuous
           dollop of grits.
                         
                          COOK
           The gator's magic.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks up from her food-hypnosis.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           (encouraging a smile)
           Awwwwwwwww.
                         
           A real smile emerges across Hushpuppy's face.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           Mmm-hmm.
                         
                         
           INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
                         
           Magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance
           floor. Strippers cradle their dates. It's all very sweet
           and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club,
           slow-dance not pole-dance.
                         
           The kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love.
           They are orphans in a heaven of mothers.
                         69
                         
                         
           We float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and
           the Cook.
                         
           The Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her. Each time we
           catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           You can take care of me. Me and
           Daddy.
                         
           After a long beat.
                         
           The Cook shakes her head `no.'
                         
                          COOK
           I don't know nothing bout your
           Daddy, I can't take care of nobody
           but myself.
                         
           This sinks into Hushpuppy.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)
           You can stay if you want.
                         
           Hushpuppy considers this for a moment, squeezes the Cook.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           This is my favorite thing.

           I know.
                         
           A far-away look has come over her. Her mind is somewhere
           else.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           I can count all the time I've been
           lifted.

           We look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's
           Wink, younger and healthier.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           I can count all the times I've been

           He is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked
           in his arm. Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries
           her.
                         
           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S)
           Wink! Bring my baby here! They
           need to wash her off.
                         
                          WINK
           Naw, that waits.
                         
           Baby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles
           Wink. She coos.

           Alright fatso, breathe some air.
                         
           They pass through a doorway and sun washes over Baby
           Hushpuppy. She smiles and smiles at the world.

           Back in reality Hushpuppy gathers herself. She's suddenly
           not hugging back, just being held.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I need to go home.

                          (WHISPERED)
           No.
                         
           Hushpuppy cups her hand to the Cook's ear and whispers
           something inaudible.
                         
           The Cook squeezes her tight, seeming on the verge of adopting
           her. But she can't. She spins Hushpuppy around and around,
           then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze.
                         
           Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying
           couples.
                         
           All goes quiet, and we sit behind Hushpuppy's head, a sea of
           light like a crown around her.
                         
           MUSIC SWELLS. Decisively, with the force of a charging
           general, Hushpuppy turns and runs toward camera.

           We turn the corner past a stretch of marsh, and come upon the
           Aurochs, four of them, now suddenly and viscerally in the
           landscape of the Bathtub, swimming steadily toward solid
           land.

           The children crest the ridge.
                         
           The RUMBLE of Aurochs hoofs is suddenly and violently
           audible.
                         
           Hushpuppy turns. She catches a glimpses of something massive
           moving behind the distant oaks.
                         
           The kids turn and hustle down the ridge.
                         
           Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard hustle down hill with
           increased urgency. The DISTANT TRAMPLING is growing louder.
                         
           Behind Hushpuppy the dark shapes of the Aurochs crest the
           ridge in a deafening STAMPEDE. Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard
           scream and sprint out in front of Hushpuppy.
                         
           Hushpuppy walks steadily forward, refusing to run. Her face
           locked with determination, she is unafraid. Her eyes shoot
           toward the shacko.

           In Wink's POV, Hushpuppy stops dead on the bridge, waiting
           for her fate, staring toward her father.

           The Aurochs bear down on Hushpuppy from behind, their
           footsteps rattling the frame. They grow inconceivably large,
           the camera has to tilt to hold the frame.
                         
           Hushpuppy balls her fists and stands her ground. Suddenly,
           she turns.
                         
           The Aurochs ROARS. Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she
           stops. She SNORTS, blowing Hushpuppy's hair back. Hushpuppy
           doesn't flinch.
                         
           The Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy. Sniffs.

           Wink is frozen in wonder, unable to believe his eyes.
                         
                         
           EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance.
                         
           Now in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet
           tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again. A low SNORT,
           or is it a purr?
                         
           The Aurochs lowers her head with respect.
                         
           Her eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own. A
           ferocious warrior.
                         
           The Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a BELLY FLOP
           that rattles the very earth, she lays down. Her three
           companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an
           almost joyful, lazy, repass.
                         
           A strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy. Almost a smile,
           but more of a peace and an affection for her equal. They're
           both children in their way.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           You're my friend, kind of.

           Mother Aurochs grunts, a sentence only Hushpuppy can
           understand.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
           I gotta take care of mine.
                         
           With weary and clumsy steps, the Aurochs stand and retreat.
                         
                         
           EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
                         
           Hushpuppy approaches the shacko. It's like walking the
           plank, but she's unafraid, at one with her destiny.
                         
           The Bathtub crew look on her in awe. They part ways to let
           her pass.
                         
           She reaches the door, steeling her reserve.
                         
           Hushpuppy opens the door.
                         
                         
           INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
                         
           Wink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin. His
           eyes are closed. His chest heaves up and down in short
           violent breaths. Hushpuppy stands and stares.
                         
           Wink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence. He knows it's the last
           time.
                         
           Wink motions for her to come closer.
                         
           Hushpuppy inches toward him. It takes all of her might. She
           sits on his bed.
                         
           Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out
           of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips
           it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite.
                         
           Hushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one
           herself.
                         
           Wink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end.
           It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and
           she paces herself to finish when he does.
                         
                          WINK
                          (BARELY AUDIBLE)
           Real good.

           Wink's chest heaves up and down, harder and harder. A tear
           rolls down his face.
                         
                          WINK (CONT'D)

           No crying, you hear?
                         
           She holds them back, being tough for her Daddy.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           No crying.
                         
           Hushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see
           a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there.
                         
           She falls into his arms and he embraces her.
                         
           Hushpuppy squeezes Wink. She does not let go. She stays
           strong.
                         
           Wink's hand trembles on her back.
                         
           She holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and
           stops. His weight slumps over her. She keeps on holding
           him, but she knows.
                         
                         
           EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY
                         
           Steadfast, Hushpuppy holds a torch on the edge of the
           Bathtub. The Turck, piled with branches, floats in front of
           her.
                         
           She lowers the flame and lights a cloth covering Wink's body
           aflame. She pushes the funeral pyre out into the current.
           We watch the boat flames drift into the foreground, covering
           Hushpuppy face with flames. She looks into them in all her
           grief and wisdom.
                         
           The group begins a funeral prayer, playing quiet in the
           background as Hushpuppy contemplates the pyre.

           from my eyes, that's all. She's
           just as big as when she left me.
           And somewhere else, other voices
           are calling out, "Here she comes!"
           And that is dying.
                         
           They raise their drinks to the sky and shout in unison.
                         
                          EVERYONE (CONT'D)
           HERE! SHE! COMES!
                         
           Hushpuppy gazes into the sparks leaping off the top of the
           fire are foregrounded in front of Hushpuppy, particles of
           Wink jumping into the sky. HORNS ENTER, droning low, and
           building into an funeral dirge.

           When I relax behind my eyes I see
           everything that made me flying
           around in invisible pieces. When I
           look too hard it goes away, but
           when it all goes quiet, I see they
           are right here.
                         
           The Turck almost disappears over the horizon. The HORNS take
           a hopeful turn, the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the
           anthem of the Bathtub.
                         
           HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
           I see that I'm a little piece of a
           big, big universe, and that makes
           things right.
                         
           Hushpuppy stands tiny on the ledge of the Earth, framed in
           front of an expanse of endless water.

"... and as he stared at the sky and listened to a cow
mooing almost dreamily in a distant village, he tried to
understand what it all meant -- the sky, and the fields,
and the humming telegraph pole; he felt that he was just
at the point of understanding it when his head started to
spin and the lucid languor of the moment became
intolerable..."

                       Vladimir Nabokov

In this script there are six main characters who inhabit
different periods of time, from pre-history to the
present day. But there is just one story. Because we
blend into one developing narrative the lives that we
show.

There is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation
or any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real
time and with real characters what other movies strive to
do with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story
is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are
dealing with is real, human magic.
In moving from one character to the next everything will
change; supporting characters, setting, period. But the
essential situation of our hero of the moment will relate
to the one before and the one following.
The magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one
character and advancing the film through hundreds or
thousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly
similar human circumstances. The effect of these transi-
tions across space and time, will let the audience grasp
the simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it
together.
The key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human
connection at the heart of the film is that one actor
will play the six individuals. The feeling will be of
the endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple
drama of being alive.
We end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time
we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh
light, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave
and the others who have gone before. The resolution of
his contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps,
we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec-
tive, too.

And the structure of the film itself has the thrill of
novelty. It has never before been used in cinema.
Never. Our six characters and their stories connect in
many different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta-
lizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the
planet itself and all its people, come and go in the
story. For the audience the game of making the connec-
tions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering
associations of their own, will be endless in this big-
gest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new
cinematic experience.                                       *

                             BEING HUMAN
      Hector is a family man. He and his woman and two
      children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a
      hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance
      by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small
      fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged
      into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it
      would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com-
      fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family.
      Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is
      simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea
      of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not
      yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector
      is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of
      Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In
      his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten
      square miles of it.


      FADE IN:
      FIRST IMAGE
      is the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The
      image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself,
      deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his
      image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When
      he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down
      closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and
      fingers a blemish on his cheek.
      Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns.
      Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some
      rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.
                               HECTOR
                 Go back home... leave me alone...

      We see that the figure is a young BOY, Hector's son.     The
      Boy thinks about it for a moment, before turning and
      disappearing behind the rocks.

      The small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to
      cook the day's meal. Beyond the fire on a rock shelf
      HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of
      eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge
      in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal. Hector
      is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing
      out at the hunters surrounding him. But in his act of
      wild rage he gets carried away. He picks up his son and
      throws him hard, much too hard, on his back.

      The Boy tumbles down   from the shelf to the cave floor at
      his mother, DEIRDRE's   feet, howling in pain. Deidre
      scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he
      would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on.
      Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics
      as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little
      form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy
      unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime
      noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci-
      nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange
      wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him?
      Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches
      his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector.

      It is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has
      diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making
      love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi-
      cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What
      has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it.
      On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children.
      As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep.
      Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover.
      We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching,
      learning children.
      Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave.
      The Boy wants to go foraging with him again.

                                 HECTOR
                   No... stay here... stay!
      Hector takes a few steps.    The Boy follows.

                                 HECTOR
                   No... go back... go away...

      Hector walks on again, taking big, angry father strides.
      The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance. Hector
      walks on for some time before turning on him.

                                 HECTOR
                   Leave me alone! Stay here...
                   Stay!

      There is real anger in his voice. The Boy wisely
      retreats to the cave. As Hector turns to continue his
      walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from
      the entrance. She holds out her arms ready to comfort
      the Boy rejected by his father. Hector is in the
      classic, timeless, no-win situation and he knows it.
      With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach.

                                                          3.         *

5   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             5
    Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles,
    seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes
    in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven
    bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its
    shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed.
    Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle
    age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and
    an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition
    a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly
    drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light
    paperwork propped up on some pillows.

    The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur-
    veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He
    watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are
    nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He
    smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro-
    vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of
    appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte-
    gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land-
    scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a
    present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist,
    never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world
    being rather empty.
    Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or
    orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows
    simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough
    comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of
    their cave.
    Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh-
    tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some-
    thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a
    smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his
    bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a
    vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and
    gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his
    eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the
    glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the
    edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular
    motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar-
    driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into
    Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the
    beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows
    is fear, blind, gut-turning fear.

6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6

    Hector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up
    the steep slope in the direction of his home.

    He stops for breath and to look back on the bay. The
    shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly
    made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal
    raiding. The boats are nearing the beach now and figures
    can be seen preparing to land. Hector gathers enough of
    his wits and strength to continue his race up the
    hillside.

7   INT. HECTOR'S CAVE - DAY                                     7

    Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to
    have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation
    there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry
    with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp-
    ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to
    them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay
    burning in their absence.
    Hector gathers his family together and they leave the
    cave.


8   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          8
    Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope
    further into the hills. His woman runs off the other
    way. A hasty, confused argument takes place.

                                 HECTOR
                 Up the hill!
                               DEIRDRE
                 No, down onto the other beach.
                 The little ones can't take the
                 hill. Neither can I.

                              HECTOR
                 Up the hill! They're down there
                 already. I saw them!

                                 DEIRDRE
                 You're wrong!
    She runs off down the slope. Hector has no choice but to
    follow her, herding the children in front of him.

    Deirdre runs on, heading for the lower slope and the cover
    of some trees. Then from these same trees she sees the
    figures of the RAIDERS coming toward her. She turns,
    running back up the hill. Hector and the children also
    turn and run back the way they have come, by now dropping
    precious bits of food and other possessions. The Raiders
    are running strongly, five or six of them.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          5.         *

     The little Girl starts to go back for a precious toy she
     has dropped. Hector picks her up and carries her off
     over his shoulder. The Boy follows.
     Deirdre is trailing behind them. She was right. She
     doesn't have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks back
     and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con-
     fusion of fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to
     go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs
     off once again with the children. Deirdre is by now
     throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers,
     hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her
     to gain some ground. But they don't stop and the effort
     tires her even more.

     She attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy
     gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers.
     the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally
     walk, the distance between them and Deirdre.
     Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still
     running. He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being
     finally surrounded by the Raiders. Then he runs on.


9    EXT. VALLEY - DAY                                          9
     Hector is tiring, too. With the Girl still awkwardly
     clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep
     slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops
     for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the
     valley below. In a moment of utter panic he lets go of
     his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on
     alone. We can sense the moment of release in his
     unburdened flight. But it doesn't last long. Some way
     up the slope he stops and turns. He sees his children,
     only now beginning to work out what has happened, and
     the raiders below. He can't do it. Even as the Girl
     calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling
     the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.

                                GIRL
                  Come back, Dada...

10   EXT. VALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                          10

     Hector and the children have reached the safety of a
     small valley higher up in the hills. The raiders have
     been slowed down by their capture of Deirdre. Hector
     is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of
     a solitary tree on the hillside. He coaxes them up into
     the higher branches.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           6.

                                BOY
                  I'm hungry.

                                HECTOR
                  Don't move from here. I'll come
                  for you in the morning. There's
                  no food. Try and sleep in the
                  branches. Don't cry. Don't make
                  a noise.
     Hector moves off, looking back to his children in the
     tree.  They too gaze anxiously at him. They don't wave.
     Maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. Hector heads off
     alone, higher into the hills.


11   EXT. ROCKS - DUSK                                          11
     It is dusk now. We find Hector waking from a fitful
     sleep behind some rocks. He sits up and takes in his
     surroundings. His face hardens as awareness of his pre-
     dicament returns. He stands up and then crouching low,
     moves off down the hill.


12   EXT. VALLEY - DUSK                                         12
     Hector has returned to the area of the tree. He slows
     down some distance away and just in time. He sees a
     figure standing beneath the tree. He moves forward to
     the protection of some rocks, and watches. He is close
     enough to hear the voice of the solitary Raider, although
     he doesn't understand the words. The Raider looks up
     into the branches and talks in a friendly, persuasive
     way.
                                RAIDER
                  It's too cold to spend all night
                  up there. We've got a fire at the
                  beach. Food, too.

     There is no response from the tree.    The Raider coaxes
     again.
                                RAIDER
                  Come on! Your mother's down
                  there. She's happy... she's warm,
                  too... and full... she wants to
                  see you... she sent me...

     His friendly tone of voice has an effect. There is
     movement in the branches. Hector can see the dark shapes
     of his two children clambering down. The Raider
     stretches out his arms and helps the Boy to the ground.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         7.

12   CONTINUED:                                                12
     Then he reaches up for the Girl, catches her as she drops
     and keeps her in his arms. He laughs in a comforting
     way.
                                RAIDER
                  That was easy, eh? You're half
                  asleep already, little girl. I'll
                  carry you.
     Hector watches the Raider and his children move slowly
     off, down the hillside, the Raider carrying the Girl in
     one arm and holding the Boy's hand. They almost look
     like a family.

13   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                        13

     It is fully dark now. On the beach the Raiders have set
     up a comfortable camp with a large fire. We are still
     with Hector. He has come down from his bleak hiding
     place in the hills. The smell of fire and food and con-
     cern for his family, have drawn him here. He is hiding
     somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to
     observe it.
     What he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. His
     family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders.
     His two children have become fast friends with the man
     who coaxed them from the tree. His woman is with a
     larger group closer to the fire. They are playfully
     attempting to communicate with her, and although still a
     little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar-         *
     barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the
     Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy
     children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages.
     For their part, the family have to accept the situation.
     Food and shelter are the best that life can offer.

     Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His
     family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In
     the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the
     headland forever. He watches them for a while longer,
     then it becomes too painful. He retreats into the dark-
     ness and up into the empty hills again.


14   EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT                                 14
     Hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a
     narrow crevice in the rocks. He doesn't sleep, or even
     attempt to close his eyes. He stares into the darkness.
     There is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi-
     losophy or religion, no friend to run to. This night he
     is utterly alone.

                                                         8.

15   EXT. ROCKS - MORNING                                       15
     In the morning it is lightly raining. Hector stands in
     the drizzle outside the shelter. It seems to revive him,
     refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however meager,
     that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc-
     tion of the shore. There is not much else that he can
     do.


16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16
     The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and
     forth from the shoreline. Hector watches from cover.
     His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            *
     whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.         *

     The last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis-
     tance to the boats. Hector watches these moments of
     departure, watches the faces of his family.
     Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and         *
     runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders
     are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the
     water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and
     impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders
     all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing
     Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling.
     Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands
     looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long
     moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their
     twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          *
     motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in
     the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange
     remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely.
     His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         *
     The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling
     and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare
     to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat.
     He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of
     Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but
     they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him.
     The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise
     man, although he's still only about thirty years old.
     The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and
     points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods
     his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector
     stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the
     boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him,
     take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        *
     as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          *
     own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           *

                                                              9.

17   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                             17
     Hector's hands have been bound with rope. He is being
     led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest and the
     Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely.
     At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the
     wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as
     they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of
     large stones at the very summit of the headland. The
     mound of stones is obviously man-made.
                            PRIEST
               I told you! I knew they did it
               around here! Ask him...
     The Leader moves closer to Hector and talks to him in a
     friendly, reasoning tone.

                             LEADER
               What do we do? Do we throw you
               over, is that the idea?
     Hector doesn't understand.    He looks at him blankly.
                             LEADER
               He wants me to throw you over.
               What does it do? Does it help the
               sun? Should I throw you over?
     The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the
     act of throwing him off the cliff. Hector doesn't know
     how to respond.
                             PRIEST
               I tell you, it's one man, one
               stone. It'll help the voyage.
     The Leader is unsure. He walks around the pile of
     stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some
     infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. He
     squats down and squints through it to the watery sun
     emerging from the clouds far out to sea. He looks across
     to Hector, now sitting on the grass. The Leader sits
     down beside him. They sit together like friends. The
     ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim.

                             LEADER
               What's it got to do with the sun?
                             PRIEST
               I don't know, yet.

     The Leader looks at Hector.    Then he makes up his mind.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              10.

17   CONTINUED:                                                     17
                                LEADER
                  No.  It's too much of a risk.
                  Just add a stone to the pile. Let
                  him go. That's the best we can
                  do.  Let's go.

     With that, he stands up. The Priest, with some       sense of
     ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks      one up
     and places it on top of the pile. He waits for       a moment,
     almost as if he expects some consequence of his      action.

                                PRIEST
                  It's meaningless, without him
                  going over the cliff.

     The Leader strides off back toward the beach. The others
     follow him, giving a final look or smile to Hector, apart
     from the Priest, who looks him up and down, regretting
     that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. Hector
     watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean-
     ingful way. He stands alone, trying to unpick the rope
     that binds his hands.
     When they are some distance from him, Hector starts to
     follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply
     trotting after them. The Raiders are aware of him behind
     them. The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector.
                                 LEADER
                  Off you go.   We don't want you.
     He turns from Hector   and moves on. Hector persists in
     following them. They    are his only connection now with
     anything that thinks   or feels in the world. His link
     with them is all that   is left. Again and again the
     Leader stops to shoo   Hector away, but Hector dumbly tags
     along behind.

18   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               18

     The Raiders wade out to the waiting boats. Hector
     follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly
     watches them. The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector
     is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the
     Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man
     clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again,
     carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the
     water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form
     of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him.
     The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in
     front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's
     family are tense with fear for his life.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         11.

18   CONTINUED:                                                 18
     Then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods
     at Hector's hands, still bound with rope. Hector under-
     stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort
     hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades
     back to the boat.

     As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The
     man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to
     Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of
     rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles.
     Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a
     moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades
     back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a
     family.

     Hector watches them for some time, his family and the
     strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from
     his view and his life.
     At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He
     goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then
     retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge,
     picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks
     off with it. It might be of some use to him.


19   INT. CAVE - DAY                                            19
     Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty
     of life. He is working on his instincts now, still
     emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of
     the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold
     some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly         *
     and blow at the fire's remains.
     We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the
     simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems
     of emotional survival without his family lie ahead.

20   INT. BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY                               20

     This is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in
     hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered
     men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given
     the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive,
     low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly
     toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets
     of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is
     WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting.
     Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood.
     We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass
     of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam
     at every joint.

                                                         12.

21   INT. BATHHOUSE - DAY                                      21
     Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A
     clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning
     conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room
     of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have
     advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the
     technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of
     the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and
     comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance,
     some around the edge of the pool, others in the water
     rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three
     or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie-
     torial way that they look after their masters gives the
     place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-
     indulged grown-ups.

     And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall,
     holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more
     healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         *
     by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face
     that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached
     from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He
     watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need
     that he might have.

     Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others
     around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        *
     man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying
     but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius'
     pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older
     man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector         *
     immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as
     Lucinnius climbs out of the water.
                             LUCINNIUS
               I'm going to the cool room.


22   INT. BATHHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                      22   *
     Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him,
     a look of concern on his face. Lucinnius' worries are
     Hector's also.
     Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various
     chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and
     the massage room as they go. All around them slaves
     attend to their pampered masters.

23   INT. BATHHOUSE - COOL ROOM - DAY                          23   *

     After an anxious scan of the cool room, Lucinnius goes
     towards three men occupying a marble bench.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                            13.

23   CONTINUED:                                                   23
     Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for
     his master to sit on as he joins the others. Hector then
     moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's
     behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to
     casually join his friends. The eldest of the three
     gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked
     man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to
     the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-
     tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal
     hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm
     smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his
     master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave
     and master exist so closely together that many of
     their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's
     feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.
     From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too,
     Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's.
     Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic
     schizophrenia?
     As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres-
     sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for
     him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's
     side as he goes. A final sarcastic     remark comes from one
     of the three.
                                MAN #1
                  Well washed, Lucinnius.

     Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.              *

24   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            24

     This is not the grandeur of Rome, but the dusty main
     street of a provincial capital in Greece or Spain or
     North Africa. It is difficult to tell from the people
     because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from
     every corner of the Mediterranean world. It has some-
     thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western,
     except that here the half-finished buildings are made of
     brick and stone.
     Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. Hector follows three
     paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the
     scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. The stool goes
     with them everywhere, in case Lucinnius has to stop in
     the street and converse with a friend. Other notables
     are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging
     along behind with their little wooden stools. Some have
     whole trains of slaves shadowing them. Human status
     symbols. Lucinnius stops near some street stalls.
     Hector stops beside him.

                                                           14.        *

24   CONTINUED:                                                  24
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Bad omens, Hector. Bad omens.
                  Get me something to eat. Just
                  a mouse or two.
                               HECTOR
                  Yes.

     Hector places the stool at Lucinnius's feet and moves off.
     Lucinnius sits down, still absorbed in his problems.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius as he orders the food.
                                HECTOR
                  Two mice... and some bread...

                               STALLHOLDER
                  No mice.
                                HECTOR
                  Two chicken legs, then, cold, and
                  the bread.
     As Hector is given the food and pays for it, he sees
     another man, JULIAN, approach Lucinnius, trailed by TWO
     SLAVES. One of them is carrying a folding chair much
     more substantial than Lucinnius's. Julian and Lucinnius
     greet one another and sit down to talk, Lucinnius at
     something of a height disadvantage. The Two Slaves move
     off to one side. Lucinnius's mood has brightened since
     the arrival of his friend. Their conversation seems open
     and friendly.
     Hector gives his master his food, and then moves to join
     the Two Slaves, hearing a snatch of the conversation as
     he goes.

                                JULIAN
                  Of course you're free to call at my
                  house at anytime, but I was
                  receiving Nepos... how could I
                  admit you?
     Hector offers to share his bread with the other Two
     Slaves. They easily fall into conversation, inevitably,
     about their masters.

                                SLAVE #1
                  Spoiled his day, meeting your man...
                  he's been avoiding him all week.

                                SLAVE #2
                  His ships have gone too, we heard.

     This is news to Hector.

                                HECTOR
                  When did you hear?
                                SLAVE #2
                  Last night. Nepos knew. Pirates.
                  They're sunk, he reckons. That
                  could finish him, eh?
                                HECTOR
                  This is the worst it's been.                           *
                                SLAVE #1
                  You'll be up for sale before you
                  know it!

     This makes them laugh, Hector less so than the other
     two.
                                HECTOR
                  He's finished... you reckon?
     The other two nod their heads.
                                SLAVE #1
                  Yes... at the baths... I could
                  tell... they smelled blood...

                                HECTOR
                  Well... if he'd pulled it off he'd
                  be in Rome by now...
                                SLAVE #1
                  And you with him...
     Hector nods his head thoughtfully.

                                HECTOR
                  And me with him... half way home...

     Lucinnius and his friend stand and exchange their final
     words, unaware of the scrutiny they have been under, or
     so used to it that they are oblivious to it. Hector
     and the Slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their          *
     positions behind their masters. The casualness of their
     conversation has gone, and they resume the formality of
     their roles.

25   EXT. STREET - DAY                                              25

     Lucinnius is eager to talk, and tosses his words over his
     shoulder to Hector.

25   CONTINUED:                                                     25
                                LUCINNIUS
                  He's a true friend, probably the
                  only one I have left.
     Hector obligingly trots a step or two closer to Lucinnius
     to aid their conversation.

                                HECTOR
                  Will he lend you the money?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  He was honest about it. He said
                  so, plain and simple. No.
                                HECTOR
                  That's a problem.

     Lucinnius unburdens himself.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  And the ships have gone... did I
                  tell you that?
                               HECTOR
                  Have they?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Cyprian knows already. He'll
                  want his money back too...
     We can see the concentration on Hector's face as he
     concocts appropriate responses.
     He has a tough occupation, being the alter ego to an
     ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and
     dangerous societies ever to exist. And he has to carry
     the stool and the towel as well.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  When we get home I want you to get
                  some chickens... and fetch Hermas,
                  the diviner.
                               HECTOR
                  Yes.

26   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               26
     At home, we find Lucinnius and Hector with the diviner
     HERMAS. They are gathered around a shrine in the large
     public room. The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of
     marble. Hermas prods them with a knife. He makes much
     of the mysteries of his craft, as if it were a skill
     beyond ordinary men.

     The other two peer over his shoulders. Suitably mysti-
     fied, Lucinnius talks in a reverent low voice.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Are my ships from Sicily still
                  afloat...?

     Hermas tetchily stops him.
                                HERMAS
                  No, no... offer the grain first...
                  sprinkle it on the altar...
     Lucinnius obeys.

                                HERMAS
                  ... and we can't ask the Gods
                  specific questions like that...
                  it's a gentle, probing enquiry...
                  general questions... but let's
                  see.
     He cuts into the chicken liver and prods around the in-
     side. The other two wait in silence.
                                HERMAS
                  General answer... no...
                                                                     *
                                LUCINNIUS
                  What do you mean?
                                 HERMAS
                  I mean, no.   The liver says no...

     Lucinnius objects.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it again... I want you to do it
                  again... Is it the Gods' will...                   *
                  that Cyprian... be well disposed                   *
                  towards me... in the future?                       *

                                HERMAS
                  If you want to do it  again, you
                  need another chicken  and another
                  fifteen sesterces...  and I'd like
                  the first fifteen now  please.
     Hector looks a Lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. Hector
     opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas.

                                                            18.

27   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           27
     Hector is giving Lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage.

     Lucinnius is still in a talking mood.   His troubles
     won't allow him to relax.
                             LUCINNIUS
               Cyprian loaned me half a million
               to fit out these ships... I'm                           *
               finished. Just when things were
               going well... I had plans for you
               too, Hector... in four or five
               years I was going to make you a
               free man... and then in ten years                       *
               you'd be a citizen... you... you                        *
               could've found your family...
               brought them here... everything...

     Hector smiles ruefully.
                             HECTOR
               It sounds good.
     Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses
     about his own future generosity.
                             LUCINNIUS
               It does, doesn't it!
     Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to            *
     rub his shoulders.
                             LUCINNIUS
               I shouldn't give up. I can't...
               I'll visit Cyprian, first thing
               tomorrow... before the others can
               get to him... he's got to see
               reason... I can pay him back...
               sometime. It's the only chance
               we have, Hector. Should I do it?
                               HECTOR
               You must.
                               LUCINNIUS
               You're right.    I must.

     This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.   His tense
     muscles yield more to Hector's fingers.
     THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a
     Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and
     moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. Lucinnius
     watches her.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Thalia, I think I need one of
                  your massages. Hector, you can                       *
                  finish the lamps.
     Hector does as he is told. He takes the torch from
     Thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing Lucinnius
     as he closes the door.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Lower, Thalia.

28   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   28

     Late at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his
     bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful
     not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him,
     some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed-
     room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a
     master's privilege.


29   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           29
     In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some
     stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack
     or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage,
     Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall.
     He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his
     head.


30   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                            30
     Odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only
     source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof.
     In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline
     of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He
     moves towards it. The figure speaks.

                                FIGURE
                  I missed you last night.
     It is Thalia. We can tell that they are close.      Hector
     sits down beside her.

                                HECTOR
                  He kept me working until morning.

                                THALIA
                  What's happening?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              20.

                                HECTOR
                  He has no money and a lot of
                  enemies. If he's very clever he'll
                  survive... but the omens are bad...
                  and he's not very clever.

                                THALIA
                  She doesn't like him.
                                HECTOR
                  Nobody does. He's unfortunate.
                  You get people like that. Clumsy
                  and sad.
     Thalia looks out towards the sea.

                                THALIA
                  Why does the thunder always stay
                  out on the ocean?
     Hector puts an arm around Thalia. At first it feels                 *
     strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter-
     of-fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the
     giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and
     the realness of their friendship. Their stroking and
     touching and holding becomes good to watch. We get a
     feeling for what they have given one another, in stolen
     hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place
     where they can be themselves.
                                HECTOR
                  It's the Gods arguing. They're
                  working out what to do with
                  Lucinnius... he'll be lying awake
                  down there... wondering what
                  they're saying about him.

     They laugh.    Far away some street DOGS BARK.
                                HECTOR
                  If he goes down I'll ask for my
                  freedom... he owes it to me... he
                  said as much... you too... we
                  could be free...

                               THALIA
                  Then what?
                                HECTOR
                  What we talk about.

     By now he is kissing her.

                                THALIA
                  We talk about going home. Yours
                  is that way and mine is that
                  way... your family is that way.
                                HECTOR
                  I just made that up... I don't                           *
                  know which way they are... anyway                        *
                  ... you can't think like that.                           *
                  Not after so many years...                               *

                                THALIA
                  It's what you talk about.
                                HECTOR
                  We talk about it because it can                          *
                  never happen. What we do is you                          *
                  and me...
                                THALIA
                  I don't understand. I think you'll
                  leave. You're going to leave me
                  here.

                               HECTOR
                  Never. It's you and me now.
                  That's all.
                                 THALIA
                  Well.   We stay here.   He'll survive.                   *
     Hector is silent, still kissing her.      He yawns as he              *
     speaks.

                                HECTOR
                  Then I can see you every night.
                  I'm tired.

31   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       31

     Hector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room,
     steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes
     him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him,
     whispering.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  I can't sleep. Get me a chicken.
                  I want to make another sacrifice.
                  We'll do it ourselves.

     Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows
     Lucinnius out of the room.

                                                           22.        *

32   INT. HENHOUSE - NIGHT                                       32
     Hector is in the henhouse, in the dark, selecting a
     chicken for sacrifice. He is about to leave when he
     sees a MAN and WOMAN, arms around each other, sitting in
     a corner. The Man looks at the white hen Hector is
     holding.

                             MAN
               Can't you find a woman, Hector...
     Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are
     only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves
     have their meeting places scattered all over the house.
                             HECTOR
               Sorry to trouble you... just
               fetching a chicken... good night
               ... the roof's free...
     The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the
     sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms.
                             HECTOR
               Come on, miss, you can tell
               Lucinnius his future.


33   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                       33
     Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian.
     Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master,
     and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's
     home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but
     there is already activity around the house, visitors
     coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor-
     tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves.
     Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door
     and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of
     quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as
     if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial
     Mr. Big.


34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34
     The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping
     and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters
     wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on
     benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the
     visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have
     an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching
     her child from a distance on its first day at school.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              23.

34   CONTINUED:                                                     34
     Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a
     little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands
     on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri-
     ficial offering himself.
     Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves
     as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by
     place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector
     to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is
     finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits.
     The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge
     within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him
     the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a
     game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door.
     One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go
     into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian.

     Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad
     smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball
     game to join him.
                                HECTOR
                  You look happier.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Relieved anyway... relieved that
                  it's over at last.
     Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector
     following after him.

35   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             35

     Lucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual
     formation. Hector is closer than normal, so that they
     can talk.

                                HECTOR
                  Will he help you?

                                LUCINNIUS
                  I have to kill myself by tomorrow
                  morning. He has all my letters to
                  Titinius, none of them got
                  through. He says it's like
                  treason... and he says I should
                  want to die for owing him half a
                  million anyway...

     Hector is shocked.

                                HECTOR
                  What if you don't...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              24.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Then he will... and that wouldn't
                  be pleasant... he would drag me to
                  Rome... those letters...
     Lucinnius shivers to think of them.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  I'm done for, Hector... but it's
                  strange... I feel kind of good
                  about it... the struggle is over
                  ... we've seen it through
                  together, eh?
                                HECTOR
                  I don't know what to say.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Let's get home. We have a lot to
                  do.
     Lucinnius quickens his pace.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Tonight... peace at last...
     Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock.


36   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               36
     Hector and Lucinnius are in his study. Lucinnius is
     busy clearing up his papers. He is less hysterical than
     in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what
     he has to do.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  We'll do it with a knife, Hector.
                  When everyone has gone to bed.
                  The two of us, to the end...

                                HECTOR
                  I don't understand. What do you
                  want me to do... I don't think I
                  can help you...

                                LUCINNIUS
                  We'll help each other, Hector. We
                  must. We've been through this
                  whole mess together... we must die
                  together.

                  asking you to die with me...
                  you're my closest, my dearest
                  slave... what would they say about
                  me if you refused to die with me?
                  This is honor... we're choosing                      *
                  death... we're not going to submit
                  to the humiliations that Cyprian
                  can heap on us, are we?

                  is we? I've done nothing... I                        *
                  know nothing...
     Lucinnius changes his tone, becomes more, in his own
     mind, frank, man-to-man.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Hector... at Cyprian's this morning
                  ... I had to sign certain papers
                  ... tell a bit of a story...
                                                                       *
                                HECTOR
                  What kind of story?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  A confession. That we were
                  plotting against Cyprian and the
                  provincial senate... we were short
                  of names... most of the people I
                  know were in the room... people I
                  thought were my friends... so I
                  mentioned you... I had to...
     Hector is stunned with shock...

                                HECTOR
                  So I'm a conspirator?

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Yes. So you see, I don't want you
                  to die with me just because of my
                  honor... it's more complicated...
                  I'm sorry, Hector. I would be
                  honored... if you would die with
                  me... I mean it...
     Hector manages to speak.

                                                              26.        *

36   CONTINUED:     (2)                                             36
                                HECTOR
                  Can I sit down?

                               LUCINNIUS
                  Of course.

                                HECTOR
                  This is the worst it's been.

37   EXT. COURTYARD - DAY                                           37

     Hector is in   the inner courtyard of the house, beside the
     kitchen. He    is talking to GALLUS, who is Lucinnius's
     ten-year-old   son. Hector has a close friendship with
     him. As we    listen to their conversation it becomes clear
     that Hector   finds comfort in the boy, for the family that
     he lost.
     Today there is an air of distraction about Hector.
     Understandable, considering his scheduled death.
     The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk.

                                HECTOR
                  But even if it's round you can
                  still fall off the edge.
     Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make
     his point.
                                GALLUS
                  No... it's not round like that...
                  it's round like this.
     Gallus sees his playball.     He picks it up.

                                HECTOR
                  Do you believe everything that
                  Greek tells you...?

     Gallus ignores this tease, intent on the ball.
                                GALLUS
                  Rome must be right in the middle...
                  here... and we must be out here
                  somewhere...
     Hector becomes more interested.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         27.

37   CONTINUED:                                                37
                                HECTOR
                  So, where is my home?

                                GALLUS
                  How many months did they march you
                  here?

                               HECTOR
                  Seven.
     Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers,      *
     as if there is serious calculation.                            *
                                GALLUS
                  It must be about here.                            *

     His fingers stop on the other side of the ball.
                                GALLUS
                  But then you'd be upside down...
                                HECTOR
                  I wasn't upside down... and how                   *
                  could you see the sun round there
                  ... I saw the sun at home... every
                  day...
     Gallus is stumped for answers.                                 *

                                GALLUS
                  I'll ask him tomorrow...                          *
     Hector remembers that he and the boy's father are              *
     supposed to die that night. He looks on Gallus with a          *
     new tenderness.
                                HECTOR
                  Yes, tell me tomorrow... I'd like
                  to know... because my children are
                  round there and I want to know
                  that they're getting the sun...
                  ask him something else, too...
                  where are the gods if the whole
                  thing is round?

                                GALLUS
                  I think I know that... they're out
                  here, and all around... that's how
                  they can look down and see
                  everything...

38   INT. ALTAR - NIGHT                                        38
     Lucinnius is at it again. In the lamplight, a live
     chicken stands on the altar.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                            28.

38   CONTINUED:                                                   38
     Hector and Lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended
     on it. Perhaps they do.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  If he eats the grain it means yes.

     He scatters some grain on the table.     The chicken at once
     begins to peck them up.
                                HECTOR
                  It's saying yes... there's a way...

                                LUCINNIUS
                  No, it's saying yes, we should die.

                                HECTOR
                  But you asked it if we had to die,
                  or if there was another way... it's
                  saying yes, there is...
                                LUCINNIUS
                  No, it's saying yes, we should die.
     The bird is certainly enjoying his food.
                                HECTOR
                  Maybe it's just hungry...
     The chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be.
39   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                     39
     A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his
     wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches
     picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is
     drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other
     household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also
     there, serving her mistress.
     Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what.
     She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook
     from the kitchen.
                                  DALMIA
                  Solus!

     The kitchen slave quickly appears.
                                DALMIA
                  Solus... I'm eating chicken again.
                  I ate chicken yesterday and the
                  day before... will I be eating
                  chicken again tomorrow? Why am I
                  always eating chicken?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           29.

39   CONTINUED:                                                  39
     SOLUS looks up at Lucinnius and Hector, but they offer
     him no help.

                                SOLUS
                  It's what we have to hand in the
                  kitchen, ma'am... I always try to
                  use the fresh stuff... the
                  chickens have just been turning
                  up...
     He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector. They look at
     each other. Thalia looks at Hector. Dalmia looks at
     them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she
     was before.

     A SLAVE interrupts them.

                                SLAVE
                  Two men have come to see you.
                  From Cyprian.
     Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a
     moment of hope. They might be coming with good news,
     perhaps a softening of Cyprian's heart.


40   INT. RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT                                 40
     The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an
     unpromising sight. They are big men, unsophisticated and
     look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A couple of
     the godfather's foot soldiers.
     They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that
     they would break his back at the whim of their master.
                                VISITOR
                  Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian
                  asked us if we could be of any                      *
                  assistance... in the business that
                  you have to conduct tonight... to
                  make that business as...                            *
                  comfortable... as you could wish...
     Lucinnius sighs, as his last hope expires.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you, gentlemen... But I feel
                  that I will be capable of taking
                  care of my affairs tonight without
                  your help... Thank Cyprian for his
                  kind thought...
     The heavies metaphorically keep their foot in the door.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          30.

40   CONTINUED:                                                 40
                                  VISITOR
                  We're   spending the night at the
                  house   of Nepos, not far from here.
                  Don't   hesitate to send your man for
                  us...   at any time... We're anxious
                  that   things should go well for you.

                                 LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you.   Good night.
                                VISITOR
                  We'll call in the morning at any
                  rate... just to make sure.
                                 LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you.

     Hector is closing the door when one of the Visitors talks
     roughly to him.
                                  VISITOR
                  You.    Come here.
     Hector instinctively looks to his master. Lucinnius
     doesn't protest, but retreats into the house. Hector is
     left alone with the Visitors.
                                VISITOR
                  He looks like the kind that'll
                  want some help. Have you ever
                  killed before?
                                HECTOR
                  Only chickens.
                                VISITOR
                  He's not much different. Use a
                  thin blade, but long. Get it in
                  deep... the heart... feel for a
                  space between the ribs...

     He prods at Hector's body freely, showing him what to do.
     If it is ticklish, Hector doesn't let on.
                                VISITOR
                  ... or go in from the back... any
                  place he'll let you...
     We leave Hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of
     coaching lessons continues.

                                VISITOR
                  Getting it out's not as easy as
                  you might think... you have to
                  twist a bit... to get over the
                  stickiness...

                                                             31.

41   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                            41
     Late at night in Lucinnius's study, an oil     lamp and a
     candle cast their shadowy light, adding to     the tension in
     the room. Hector stands beside Lucinnius,      who is
     counting out coins and other valuables on     his table.
                             LUCINNIUS
               Eight hundred sesterces... cash
               ... that's all that's left... what
               a failure... my father left me
               three farms and forty thousand...

     Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. He is
     quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. Hector however is
     cold sober, grim-faced. Lucinnius looks up at him.

                             LUCINNIUS
               Nothing else to be done.    Don't
               you want some wine?
                             HECTOR
               No... but I want something...
                               LUCINNIUS
               What is it?
                             HECTOR
               I want to die a free man... I
               don't want to die a slave...

     Lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile. He              *
     clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony
     into his voice.
                                LUCINNIUS
               Hector,    by this proclamation, I
               make you    a freed man... I don't
               know the    exact words... I've never
               done it    before... But you're free,
               Hector.
                                                                        *
                             HECTOR
               In writing... so that when they
               find me... they know I died a free
               man... please...

     Lucinnius looks at him for a moment, then reaches out for
     his paper and pen.
                               LUCINNIUS
               Very well...

     He scratches out a few words on the paper, Hector looking
     over his shoulder, keenly watching what he writes.
     Lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              32.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  They'll find it in the morning.
                  It's a nice thought, Hector... you
                  were right to ask.
                                  HECTOR
                  Thank you.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Well... freed man, let's do it.                         *

     Lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on
     the table. He fingers its blade.
                                                                          *
     A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.       Will the
     half-drunk Lucinnius want to kill him first?

                                HECTOR
                  What do you want me to do?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Nothing... I mean, not to me... I
                  have to do it first... you
                  understand that... and then you...
                  if I don't succeed... then you
                  must help me...
                                  HECTOR
                  I understand.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  No point in messing up the room.
                  Let's go downstairs.

     Lucinnius stands and leaves the room.     Hector follows
     with the oil lamp.


42   INT. PASSAGE - NIGHT                                            42
     The house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the
     passage and down the stairs to the washing room. Hector
     walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled,
     defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first
     quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector
     looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping,
     that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household.

43   INT. WASH ROOM - NIGHT                                          43

     Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of
     distress, with drink and terror and self pity.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              33.        *

43   CONTINUED:                                                     43
     He runs into the tiled washing room, wails loudly and
     makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector sees all
     of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius
     crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls
     out in pain.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Oh, that hurts, that stings!
     Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool,
     holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They
     both look down at the blade, still in Lucinnius' body.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  This is hopeless.

     They sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither
     of them knowing what do do next. It's awkward, like in a
     waiting room. Then Lucinnius speaks.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Help me, Hector...
                                HECTOR
                  You've done it... you've done it
                  ... lie down...
     Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
     He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor.
                                HECTOR
                  Close your eyes... you did it...
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you, thank you.
     The movement has increased the spread of blood over
     Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  You do it now, Hector... hurry...

                                HECTOR
                  Lie still... lie still...

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it Hector... do it... you
                  promised...
     It looks as if Hector is playing for time.

                                HECTOR
                  Shush... I'll need the knife...
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           34.

43   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           43
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Take it... do it...

     Lucinnius' voice is fading now. Hector waits, then
     reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius' stomach. We
     see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we
     detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius
     on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. It's
     as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released
     from the wound. His voice is even more faint.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it, Hector... do it... do it...
     Hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits,
     looking at Lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from
     him.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it... do it... do it...
     The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still.
     Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands    up,
     suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly    he
     gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws     the
     knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor.
     Hector has run out of the room before it has come to    rest
     against the wall.

44   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                          44
     Hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain-
     ing the coins. He puts most of them into a leather money
     bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on
     Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns
     quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the
     table. Then just as he is leaving, he again stops, sits
     down on the chair, pulls off his worn shoes and places on
     his feet a pair of Lucinnius's stout street sandals.
45   EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                      45

     Hector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the
     courtyard to the street gate. Near the gate he stops
     and looks back at the house. He makes a decision and
     retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into
     the house.
46   INT. THALIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                  46

     Thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor
     with two other women. Hector gently shakes her shoulder,
     trying not to wake the others. After a moment or two
     Thalia opens her eyes.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              35.

46   CONTINUED:                                                     46
     Hector whispers to her before she has time to open her
     mouth.

                                HECTOR
                  I'm leaving... come now if you
                  want to... but we must hurry...
                  I'm a free man... I'm free.
                  Will you come?

47   EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT                                            47

     The shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the            *
     harbor are Hector and Thalia.                                       *

     Nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading
     and preparing ships for the morning tide. By the light
     of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard, voices shout,
     WINCHES CREAK. Hector encounters a night WATCHMAN, but
     diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him.
                                HECTOR
                  I have some mail for Tyre... where
                  are the east-bound ships?
                                WATCHMAN
                  Ask at the harbor.                                     *
     With an authoritative nod, Hector strides off in the
     direction of the noise and lights, Thalia at his heels.
     Hector talks when the Watchman is out of earshot.
                                HECTOR
                  We want a timber ship... they go
                  west... straight to Rome...

                                 THALIA
                  And then?   Then you go home?                          *
     Hector hurries on, noncommittal in his reply.

                                HECTOR
                  You can go to anywhere from Rome.


48   EXT. QUAY - NIGHT                                              48
     Hector and Thalia approach a ship heavily laden with
     timber. Final supplies are being carried aboard, super-
     vised by two men on the quay. Hector approaches them.

                                HECTOR
                  Where is the Captain?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         36.

48   CONTINUED:                                                 48
                                CREWMAN
                  He's on the ship.

     He indicates a man standing on the rear deck. Hector and
     Thalia climb up the gangplank and approach him.

                                HECTOR
                  Good morning, Captain... I'm
                  looking for passage to Rome, for
                  both of us...

                                CAPTAIN
                  And who might you be?
                                HECTOR
                  I'm the steward of Lucinnius the
                  merchant... we have business in
                  Rome... I need an immediate
                  passage...
                                CAPTAIN
                  It's five or six days... to                        *
                  Brundisium... you can walk or ride
                  from there... you have money?
                               HECTOR
                  Of course.
                                                                     *
                                CAPTAIN
                  Well, let's see... passage for
                  two... food for two... six days...
                  what were you thinking of offering?
                                HECTOR
                  When do you leave?
                                CAPTAIN
                  Anxious to leave, are you?
                                HECTOR
                  Keen to start, yes.

49   INT. SHIP - DAY                                            49
     Hector and Thalia are asleep, huddled together in a cor-
     ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters.

     A CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake. He stirs himself
     to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY, the sounds of the SEA-
     WASH, the WIND in the CANVAS, the MOANS of the TIMBERS.

                                CREWMAN
                  Captain says to come on deck.
     Hector wakes Thalia and they clamber out of the darkness
     of the hold onto the brightest, freshest of days at sea.

                                                          37.

50   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                             50
     There is no sign of land behind them. The ship is moving
     swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a light sea. We
     can tell from Thalia's reactions that she has never been
     out at sea before, at least never above deck. Every-
     thing is novel to her and it shows, even the movement of         *
     the ship. Her excitement is childlike.

                             THALIA
               Where's the land gone?
                                                                      *
     Hector, too, is taken by the novelty of it all but is
     less prepared to admit it. He waves his hands around the
     empty horizon noncommittally.
                             THALIA
               Have you been on a ship before?

                             HECTOR
               Yes, of course.
     We can tell he is lying.
                             THALIA
               Me, too, but they kept us down
               there.
     She points down into the lower depths of the hold.   Then
     she gets even more excited.

                             THALIA
               Tonight... we'll be where the
               thunder is!
     They look at each other and then all around them. The
     freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of
     freedom, exhilarate them. Their senses and their
     feelings, are in new territory. They are like children
     in a brand-new world.
     The Captain on the other side of the ship, beckons them.         *

                             CAPTAIN
               Thought you would like to see
               them.

     He points to three shapes in the mid-distance, ships
     heading for the port they have left. There is a thrill           *
     in their glamor, their fine progress under full sail.
                             CAPTAIN
               Your master's ships... going
               home...
                                                                      *

                                                              38.

                                HECTOR
                  No... they can't be... they're
                  lost...
                                CAPTAIN
                  No they're not... I know these
                  ships... my brother-in-law's the
                  master of the big one with the
                  brown sail...
     Hector and Thalia look at each other. The Captain smiles
     at them and looks back to the ships, coursing healthily
     on their way.
                                CAPTAIN
                  Somebody been putting the wind up
                  Lucinnius? That's an old one...
                  didn't think anybody'd fall for
                  that...


51   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                                 51
     Later, the ship is still making brisk progress. Thalia
     and Hector are sitting on deck, some distance from one
     another. They are quieter now, more thoughtful. Hector               *
     catches her eye. Hector is drawn by her smile and moves              *
     to join her. They sit quietly, absorbed in thought,
     thoughts of each other, their looks and smiles tell us
     that. As if they are talking without words. Hector
     looks around him. A sailor on the forward deck is
     sorting out some rope, an echo of a previous time and                *
     place. The wind catches the sailor's hat. He grabs it
     from the air and spends time arranging it once more on
     his head, just so. A tiny human moment.                              *


52   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                                52
     A man is driving a heavy two-horse wagon. The wind has
     just lifted his hat from his head. He spends some time
     replacing it carefully, just so. Watching him from the
     back of the wagon is Hector.
     The drama of the lives of Thalia and Hector      has played
     itself out long ago. Between the breath of       sea breeze
     that lifted the hat of the Roman sailor and      the gust of
     mountain wind that snatches the hat of the      wagoner, lies
     1400 years.                                                          *

     Hector sits   in the wagon beside a woman. There are
     tantalizing   similarities between their situation and the           *
     one we left   Thalia and Hector in on the boat a few
     moments ago,   1400 years ago.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               39.

     The woman and Hector exchange glances now and then,
     delicate signals of mutual awareness. Talking without
     words.
     They are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load
     of timber. With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of
     about eight. The Girl is tearful. A man, his face
     unseen, is snoring underneath his hat. A younger man,
     gaunt and hungry-looking, is dressed in the rough
     travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST. Even without his
     habit we would know he was a holy man. His incessant
     talk tells us.
                                PRIEST
                  We want to praise God because we
                  live in this ultimate age, when
                  all things are done, all is known,
                  all the wonders of his creation
                  revealed to us... nothing more for
                  man to see or do... all that is
                  left is the hope of salvation...
                  even for our humbler sisters...
     The Girl is sobbing through all of this.
                                PRIEST
                  Yes weep, child, weep for joy...
                  you are a glorious example to us
                  all... already a child of God's...
                  blessed to spend your earthly days
                  within his church as Christ's
                  servant... what generous parents
                  you have... giving you to the
                  sisters... What a sacrifice.                            *
     There is an Irish lilt to his voice which colors what                *
     he is saying with a tinge of mischief. He is a difficult
     fellow to pin down. Hector looks at him amusedly, still              *
     sharing his thoughts silently with the woman, BEATRICE.
     The Nun interrupts the Priest cheerfully.

                                NUN
                  She's already received the last
                  rites, before she left her family.
                  She belongs to God now... Don't you?                    *

     The child sobs more noisily.                                         *
                                PRIEST
                  Fortunate child, destined for
                  paradise. Untouched by the
                  abiding curse of carnal lust.   I

                  I will not join myself carnally
                  with any woman...
     He looks accusingly at Beatrice.                               *

                                PRIEST

                  from this world to the next... as
                  should every man...

     Now Hector is getting the hard looks from the Priest.
                                PRIEST
                  ... If all men forsook forever the
                  fleshy temptations... and held
                  womankind to barrenness... think
                  how much the sooner would come the
                  day of judgement... all God's
                  chosen gathered in paradise... I've               *
                  written a small treatise in favor                 *
                  of virginity, sister. We could                    *
                  discuss it later if you like...                   *

     The DRIVER of the wagon turns his head briefly to the
     Priest.
                                DRIVER
                  What are you talking about?
     Hector gestures to Beatrice that he is leaving the wagon
     to walk for a while and asks her to join him. She shakes
     her head with a smile. Hector smiles, too, then jumps
     down from the wagon and, walking slowly, allows it to
     gain ground in front of him. The ramblings of the Priest
     fade away.

                                PRIEST
                  It's simple, brother... if we
                  cease carnal union entirely then
                  in fifty or so years we'll all be
                  rid of our earthly lives and God
                  can proceed with His reign over
                  His heavenly kingdom... that same
                  paradise that God gave to man
                  before, but which man was so unfit
                  to inhabit that within seven hours
                  Eve was already tempting her
                  master and mate, and within nine
                  hours the Lord had to expel the
                  both of them! Just think, they                    *
                  messed it up in nine hours!                       *

                                                         41.

53   EXT. MOUNTAIN TRACK - DAY                                 53
     Hector smiles as the Priest's VOICE FADES into the dis-
     tance. It is a  cold fresh day of early summer. They are       *
     travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles on
     his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket.
     The last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed
     WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector lays himself down at the           *
     side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND
     in the distance makes him open them again. He listens.
     MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley.
     He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see
     nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then
     he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted
     skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge
     crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley.
     There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with
     twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such
     a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is
     ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this
     distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence
     is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us
     there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector
     has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to
     some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is
     where he belongs, in Medieval Europe.
     Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him         *
     he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise
     citizen of a violent age, Hector knows when to leg it.


54   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                          54
     Hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto
     it, happily back in the security of his fellow                 *
     travellers. He smiles at Beatrice.                             *

                             HECTOR
               A bit cold... walking...
     She smiles at him. He sits opposite her in the wagon,
     and allows his foot to touch hers. She doesn't move
     away. Hector calls to the Driver.
                             HECTOR
               How long to get there?

                             DRIVER
               When it gets dark, we'll be there.                   *

     Hector looks at Beatrice.

                                HECTOR
                  I thought I heard fighting... back
                  there...
     Beatrice replies, but in a language that Hector doesn't
     understand.

                                BEATRICE
                  I don't know what you're saying...
                  I haven't understood anything
                  you've said all day...

     Hector talks back to her.
                                HECTOR
                  I don't know what you're saying...

     They both smile. It doesn't seem to disturb them too
     much that they don't share a language. They repeat                  *
     their incomprehensible statements, just for the fun of
     it.
                                BEATRICE
                  I don't know what you're saying.
                                HECTOR
                  I don't understand.
     Beside Hector the Girl has stopped sobbing but she is
     still troubled. She turns to him and speaks quietly but
     with determination.
                                GIRL
                  I want to go home to my mother.
     Hector doesn't know how to respond. He can do nothing               *
     to help her, and anyway, is more interested in Beatrice.            *

55   EXT. FARMYARD - NIGHT                                          55

     It is almost dark when the wagon finally turns into the
     yard of the farm where they will spend the night.

56   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         56

     The Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with
     simple food, a stew, bread and wine. The travellers settle
     down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out
     of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife
     working at the open fire.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Just bread and water for me,
                  Mistress. I have no need of wine
                  or meat.
     She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving
     thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace
     quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver-
     sation with the Almighty.

57   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         57
     In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an
     upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a
     blanket of soft sound over the human forms.

     One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector,
     in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes
     aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and
     picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure
     pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the
     distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to
     toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and
     moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs.
     Hector rouses himself and follows the other.


58   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         58
     Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The                 *
     figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING
     there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the
     Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth
     as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under
     his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector
     standing by the table. They recognize one another and
     relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He
     speaks normally, cheekily.

                                PRIEST
                  God, I'm starving. Do you think
                  I dare heat that up on the fire?

     He indicates the large pot containing the remains of the
     stew.
                                PRIEST
                  No... I'll eat it cold... I
                  deserve to suffer.

     He pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the
     table to Hector.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                44.

     Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks
     of meat as they talk.

                                PRIEST
                  Have some wine.

     Hector takes a drink.

                                HECTOR
                  I saw some fighting today... back
                  up the road...

                                PRIEST
                  So, the mad knights are at it
                  again... what were they, Swiss
                  or English?

                                  HECTOR
                  I don't know.    They all look the
                  same to me.
                                PRIEST
                  It might help us get through...
                  if there's a bit of confusion...
                  we'll still travel separately
                  though, for now.
     The Priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own
     holy act.
                                PRIEST
                  But, Hector, you must keep out
                  of the way of temptation... I saw
                  the way you were eyeing up that
                  widow... now stay away from
                  that... although she is beautiful,
                  is she not... but we're going
                  home, remember.
     Hector is smiling.

                                HECTOR
                  How do you know she's a widow?
                                PRIEST
                  Look at her eyes... hungry eyes...
                  she could lead you into trouble...
                  she smells like paradise, though.
     He changes his tone yet again.       He talks straight.

                  Listen, Hector, let's get this
                  clear... if anyone's going to dally
                  with that widow it'll be me... you
                  couldn't handle her... she'd
                  bewitch you... at any rate, you're
                  not a sinning kind of fellow, are
                  you... why don't you get off up
                  the road tomorrow, and I'll catch
                  you up, in five or so days...

     Hector doesn't answer, but smiles. The Priest has
     stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely.
                                PRIEST
                  You're not a sinning fellow,
                  remember... another month and
                  we'll be at the channel, then
                  home... the little ones you only
                  talk about when you're drunk...
                  don't forget them...
     Hector still remains silent.        The Priest is worried.

                                PRIEST
                  Why do I always talk so much...
                  you weren't even thinking of her
                  'til I opened my mouth... but I
                  trust you... don't worry. I know
                  you wouldn't do anything to anger
                  your God, or me. Get me some
                  bread.
     Hector obeys the Priest without thought.        The Priest is           *
     happier now that he is in control again.
                                PRIEST
                  Who saved your neck in Venice?
                                HECTOR
                  You did, Ronald.

     Hector approaches the Priest with the bread.
                                PRIEST
                  And don't you forget it.

     He raises his cup to Hector.
                                PRIEST
                  May the Lord forgive us our sins,
                  those we have committed and those
                  we as yet only dream of. She's
                  a glory of a woman.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     For all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of
     vulnerabililty in Ronald. For all his bluster, there is
     the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims
     Hector needs him.

59   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            59

     Overnight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh             *
     from battle, have collected in the courtyard. Some are
     tired, dispirited, others are wounded. Our Travellers               *
     watch from the farm window. A few mounted knights come
     into the yard, herding in front of them a small group of
     prisoners, well-dressed knights and squires.


60   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                           60
     The travellers look out on the exciting scene, and talk
     as they eat their breakfast of bread and milk.
                                PEDLAR
                  Hostages, too, they've got... they
                  only take the rich ones...
     He turns to the forlorn Girl.
                                PEDLAR
                  Have you ever seen so many fine,
                  rich men, my girl?
     Hector talks to the company, but means his words for the
     Priest.

                                HECTOR
                  I won't be travelling today.

     The Priest looks him straight in the eye.
                                PRIEST
                  The fighting's behind us, brother
                  ... you'll be safe enough.
     Hector shakes his head, catching Beatrice's eye.

                               HECTOR
                  I'll stay.
                                PRIEST
                  You should go.

     The Nun puts an arm around the Girl.

                  We're going. God will protect
                  his ewe lambs.                                          *
     Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man-
     handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the
     room. They scatter the food from the table and lay out
     the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows
     them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS
     are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered
     out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The
     ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the
     head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the
     helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the
     joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems
     inhuman, robot-like.

                                SOLDIER
                  Must be sore in there.   Is it your
                  dada?
     The Squire looks at him and nods his head.       Hector looks        *
     with sympathy at the boy.                                            *

                                SOLDIER #2
                  If he's got a little head it might
                  be alright. Has your dada got a
                  big head?

     An OFFICER comes into the room.
                                OFFICER
                  Is there a blacksmith here?
                  Where's the smith?
                                FARM WOMAN
                  In the village, sir, half a day
                  away.
     The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at
     the astonished group of Travellers. He picks on the
     Priest.
                                OFFICER
                  You, Priest, come here... get to
                  work on him... he's not ready for
                  heaven yet... there's a hundred
                  thousand livres on his head if I
                  get him to Paris alive... Start                         *
                  praying... there's fifteen livres
                  in it for you if he lives...

     The Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to
     pray earnestly. The Officer turns to the Soldiers.

                  and one of you get back down into
                  the valley and fetch an armorer.

     The Soldiers scatter to   carry out their orders. Hector            *
     takes time to watch the   Squire still kneeling beside his          *
     father, quietly stroking   the helmet. Ronald the Priest
     mutters every prayer he   can remember. The suit of armor
     twitches and MOANS.

     Hector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow
     him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they
     slide past the table and head for the door.


61   EXT. FARM - DAY                                                61
     More soldiers have continued to make their way to the
     shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of war.
     Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the
     medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups.
     Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost
     souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their
     comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir-
     teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in
     expensive armor.

     Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they
     can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers,
     reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are
     much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci-
     plined unit.
     Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground
     drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they
     perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same
     pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting
     their pikes in unison. They become like one evil,
     inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                *
     more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector
     and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not
     sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they
     soon employ this as another titillating element in their
     love-play.

                                HECTOR
                  I think you know what I'm saying
                  ... a little...

                  a word.
                                HECTOR
                  How come you don't speak like
                  anyone else? Are you far from
                  home? Home? Where you sleep
                  and live?
                                BEATRICE

                  I'm far from home, too... way, way                    *
                  over there... then across the sea...
                                BEATRICE
                  You're losing me again.

                  Have you ever seen the sea? Water                     *
                  everywhere... right to the end of
                  the world... I come from the other
                  side of the little water, then                        *
                  there's the big, big water... I                       *
                  had a friend who sailed on that...                    *
                  went too far... fell right over                       *
                  the edge... into nothing. They
                  never came back... they fell off
                  the world...
     Hector smiles, pleased with himself.    Beatrice laughs.
                                HECTOR
                  You think that's funny? It's
                  true... it's a sad story... you
                  shouldn't laugh.
                                BEATRICE
                  Talk about home again... remember                     *

     Beatrice has her way, turning the tables on Hector.    He
     says it in her language.

                  Home... home...
     Beatrice smiles. In this tiny victory the dynamic of
     their relationship is set.

                  That's it... clever boy!

     They fall silent, suddenly shy. Beatrice breaks this             *
     moment by reaching out to Hector's neck, very delicately,
     like a caress. Hector smiles. There first touch. Then            *
     it changes. Beatrice completes her movement with a sharp
     grab at Hector's hair, and pinches her fingers on something.
     Triumphantly she shows him the flea she has caught.

     She ruffles his hair, in a motherly but then again sex-                  *
     ually provocative way. He understands her well now.

     Ronald the Priest still kneels by the inert knight in
     armor. The boy Squire still sits by his father's head.
     Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight
     is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or
     moaning. The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid
     as we look at it. There is no sense of it containing
     life. The Officer re-enters the room from outside.
                                 OFFICER
                  How is he?
                                PRIEST
                  Sleeping now... at peace, for the
                  moment.
                                OFFICER
                  Leave him for a while. There are                            *
                  a few souls out here you can help
                  on their way to heaven. Ten sous                            *
                  a soul to you... come on.

     The Officer leaves.       Ronald quickly follows him outside.            *
                                RONALD                                        *
                  Twenty sous is normal.    How many                          *
                  are there?                                                  *

     When they have gone the Squire gives his father a nudge,                 *
     but there is no response from the knight, just the
     impression of lifeless bulk.

63   EXT. FARM - DAY                                             63
     Hector and Beatrice have found some privacy, near the
     trees and by a low wall. Some bushes hide them from
     full view of the farm yard. Hector is sitting cross-
     legged and Beatrice kneels behind him, giving his head
     a thorough going over. Mutual grooming is the original,
     and perhaps the best, form of foreplay. Hector certainly
     likes it.

                              BEATRICE
               That's four.

                             HECTOR
               Yes, it does feel good.
     She gives his scalp a final delicious rub, and then stops.

                             BEATRICE
               You can do me now.
     Beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and
     shoulders. Hector begins to probe her hair and scalp.            *
     She arches her back under the first touch of his fingers.
     Hector laps it up, inspired to caress ever more tenderly         *
     her scalp and neck, still with the outward purpose of
     looking for fleas.
                             HECTOR
               Got one... a tiny little one...
               yours are so small... and fair...                      *
     To Hector even her fleas are a delight. He seems to want         *
     to keep it as a pet. There is no hope for this man.              *
     Beatrice moans softly, happily. Hector still kneading            *
     her scalp.
                             HECTOR
               I don't know your name. I'm
               Hector... who are you? I'm
               Hector.
     Beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness.

                             BEATRICE
               Hector... yes... I'm Beatrice...

                              HECTOR
               Beatrice.
                             BEATRICE
               Yes. Hector... I think you'll
               have to do under my arms... I'm
               a little itchy there...
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              53.

63   CONTINUED:                                                     63
                                HECTOR
                  Yes, I think Beatrice is a good
                  name.                                                  *
     Beatrice is sighing contentedly now.

                                BEATRICE
                  Maybe we should find the river,
                  and have a proper wash...
     In between parting the hairs on her scalp Hector is kiss-
     ing her on the neck now. At first it is small, snatched
     kisses amongst the grooming, but soon the kisses become
     longer and the grooming less.

                                BEATRICE
                  I'm still itchy lots of places,
                  Hector.

64   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            64
     The Priest is with some seriously wounded soldiers, laid
     out in a corner of the farmyard. Whether he is a bogus
     priest or not, Ronald is taking his duties seriously.
     There is a little of the rogue about him now. He sees
     the Nun and the little Girl preparing to leave. They
     have acquired a mule. They mount up, the Girl behind
     the Nun, and plod off through the farmyard. They stop
     briefly beside the Priest to say their farewells.
                                PRIEST
                  Goodbye, little girl... the Lord
                  will bless you, I know, in his
                  house.
     He talks to the Nun as they move off.

                                PRIEST
                  How long for you on the road?

                                NUN
                  Three or four days.
                                PRIEST
                  Good luck to you.

                                NUN
                  They're not killing nuns, yet.

                                PRIEST
                  The Saxon, won't he go with you?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           54.        *

64   CONTINUED:                                                  64
                                NUN
                  He's nowhere to be seen.

     The Priest watches them go, and then returns to his
     duties with the wounded.


65   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                            65
     The Nun's mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off
     along the track. A few Soldiers are burying some of
     their dead nearby. The Nun watches this and doesn't see
     what the Girl sees on the other side, the mingled bodies
     of Hector and Beatrice, all pretence at grooming now
     gone, engaged in fervent lovemaking. It's probably the
     first and last that the Girl will see. A smile flickers
     across her face before she turns away forever. Ahead of
     her there might be many a bleak night in her convent
     when she will remember the image, and that same smile
     will return to her lips.

66   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                         66

     The Priest is kneeling beside a young wounded Soldier.
     He is close to death, but in his youth is fighting it.
     He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.
                                SOLDIER
                  My name is Peter... don't forget
                  ... tell everybody that was my
                  name... Peter...
     Ronald is mumbling his prayers.
                                PRIEST
                  Lie still, Peter...

                                SOLDIER
                  That's it, Peter... tell everybody
                  ... write it... don't forget it...
                  Peter... tell them Peter died here
                  ... my name is Peter... Peter...
                  say it again.

     Ronald stays with the boy as he struggles against his
     own annihilation.
                               PRIEST
                  Peter...

     Ronald behaves well with the dying boy.

                                                         55.

67   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                     67
     The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. He
     yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has completed the
     hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest,
     if he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre-
     tence has been just as exhausting. He wants to sleep.


68   INT. FARMHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                     68
     In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the
     darkness. Some officers have moved in and the place is
     more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to
     his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She
     snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long
     sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration.

     He steps over her and settles into his own space by the
     window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He
     looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the
     Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging
     her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of
     sleep.
     The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know
     why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of
     Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose
     detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           *
     cloak over his head.

     Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering
     beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark,
     also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest.


69   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       69
     The Priest wakes up. Outside he can hear the first
     sounds of the day, the murmuring VOICES of Soldiers in
     the yard, the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS. In the room it is
     still semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have
     already left, but Beatrice is there, stretching herself
     and fixing her hair. Hector is not with her. She smiles
     at the Priest. Then, in another part of the room, Hector
     emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up
     and smiles too.

                               HECTOR
               Good morning.
     Hector and Beatrice look at each other. The Priest looks
     at them in turn. Their cheeky act of innocence mocks
     him.

                                                              56.

70   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            70
     Hector is washing himself by the stream that flows close
     by the yard. He drinks a handful of water for breakfast.
     The Priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join
     him.                                                                *
     Hector is in a cheerful mood, pleased with himself and
     his success with Beatrice. The Priest is sullen,
     reproachful.
                             HECTOR
               You're a busy man, what with all
               these souls departing.
                             PRIEST
               There's nothing wrong with helping
               someone to die in peace. They
               want me to go with them.
                             HECTOR
               Nothing at all.
                             PRIEST
               Are you staying here?

                             HECTOR
               Moving on, as you told me to...
               we'll meet up, like you said.
               I'll wait for you at the channel.
                                                                         *
                             PRIEST
               She'll do you harm. I told    you.
               She might be a witch. Wait    for
               me. I still have the money     from
               Venice. We can be home in    a
               month.
                             HECTOR
               Witch my arse. Stop giving me
               orders.
     Both of them are unhappy now, confusing one another,
     spoiling their friendship.
                             HECTOR
               You're a strange fellow. Are you
               a priest? Are you jealous?

     The Priest is silent. They are saved from hurting each
     other more. A Soldier shouts down to them from the farm.

                             SOLDIER
               We're moving soon, Father.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              57.

70   CONTINUED:                                                     70
     The Priest turns to Hector for what might be the last
     time.

                                PRIEST
                  So, you're leaving?

                                HECTOR
                  You have work to do here.
     The Priest walks back up to the farm. Hector calls out              *
     what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another            *
     taunt.
                                HECTOR
                  I don't understand you.

     The Priest looks back at him briefly, then walks on.


71   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                               71
     Hector and Beatrice have packed their few belongings into
     a shoulder bag. They turn out of the farmyard and walk
     down the main track.
     Hector catches a last glimpse of the Priest being helped
     onto the back of a horse, behind a Soldier. He is ridden
     off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop.
     Other battles lie ahead to be blessed, and more battered
     bodies requiring comfort.
     Hector and   Beatrice are enjoying the first pulse-
     quickening   flush of their intimacy, and the thrill of
     knowing it   will go further. They chatter freely,                  *
     despite not   sharing a language.
                                HECTOR
                  I'm glad we're going the same way.
                                BEATRICE
                  We'll have to sleep in the hills
                  tonight. Will you keep me warm?
     The damp greyness of the early morning has lifted and the
     sun is shining as they step out onto the higher hills.


72   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                            72
     Hector and Beatrice have stopped to eat. They shelter in
     the fold of a hillside, with a wide stream running some
     way below. Hector feeds Beatrice a piece of cheese from
     his knife.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             58.

72   CONTINUED:                                                    72
                                BEATRICE
                  Hurry up and finish your wine and
                  then we can make love.
     Hector seems to know what she is saying. He throws down
     his knife and cheese, lying down with her on the grass.
     He kisses her breasts and her body eagerly. He lifts her
     skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs.
     She stretches herself out happily, arms spread wide on
     the grass. Hector talks through his kisses.

                                HECTOR
                  Why do you smell so wonderful?
     He lifts his head to let her see him sniffing.                     *

                                BEATRICE
                  Oh, you like my smell, do you? I
                  make it from the flowers. I put                       *
                  it here, and there, and there.
     Hector kisses her more. She smiles and turns her head to
     the sky. Then she starts to giggle.

                                BEATRICE
                  I don't believe it... someone's
                  watching us, the dirty devil...
                  don't look... he's down by the
                  water, by the rocks...
     Hector doesn't understand, and keeps on with his kissing.
     Only her persistent giggling makes him stop and look up.           *
     Hector sees him too. Down by the stream a head peering
     over the top of a rock, not even attempting to hide.
                                                                        *

                  Cheeky devil.

                                HECTOR
                  He's not moving. He must've seen
                  us, though.
                                                                        *
     She sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly
     anxious.

                                BEATRICE
                  Don't look at him anymore. Let's
                  go... down the other side of the
                  hill.

     But Hector still looks at the figure in the distance.
     There is an uneasy silence while Hector works it out.
     Then he speaks.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                HECTOR
                  It's a dead man.

     Beatrice doesn't understand.        Hector stands up, still
     looking at the figure.

                                HECTOR
                  Come on, we're going that way at
                  any rate.
     They move cautiously. When they are closer to it, and                 *
     can see it for what is is, they walk straight for the
     dead body.

73   EXT. HILLSIDE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                              73   *

     It is the body of a young squire, handsomely dressed
     in the livery of his master. Such a squire would follow
     his knight into battle, guiding him through the chaos.                *
     But this boy seems to have died a less public, more
     furtive death. He lies leaning against a rock, eyes
     open, an expression something like a smile on his face.
     There is no sign of a wound.
     Hector looks around at the ground.
                                HECTOR
                  No sign of a battle... only a few
                  horses... or just one. He wasn't
                  killed in a fight.
                                BEATRICE
                  Poor boy. Isn't he fine-looking.
                  Look at his shoes.
     There is a sadness about this young death in such a
     lonely place. Hector and Beatrice are open to this sad-               *
     ness, but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain.
                                BEATRICE
                  We'll cover his eyes at least...
                  so the crows don't get him. Look
                  at these shoes, though.

     She is already gathering stones.        Hector sees what
     Beatrice is doing.
                                HECTOR
                  That's good of you.

     As he lays him down Hector sees a small, dry wound on
     the boy's side. Beatrice brings her armful of stones and
     starts to build a mound around the squire's head.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     Hector helps her by gathering stones from the stream.
     Soon they have covered his head completely with stones,
     his body lying exposed.
                                HECTOR
                  It's all we can do. It won't keep
                  the wolves away though.

     Beatrice is still taken by the boy's shoes.
                                BEATRICE
                  His feet are like mine, you know.
                  I'll give you mine, poor boy, and
                  I'll have yours. I have more
                  walking to do.

     She looks at Hector.
                                BEATRICE
                  It's not stealing if I give him
                  mine, is it?
     Hector watches as Beatrice exchanges her old shoes for
     the squire's. They fit her well, and she proudly shows
     them off to Hector. He smiles at her.

74   EXT. STREAM - DAY                                             74

     Later, Hector and Beatrice are enjoying each other
     immensely, making love by the stream. Beatrice hasn't
     removed her new shoes, she likes them so much. She is
     dabbing Hector with her perfume which, he has discovered,
     she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain
     around her neck.
                                                                        *
     Nearby the corpse of   the squire still lies, its head
     shrouded in stones,   as if absurdly hiding its eyes from
     the antics of Hector   and Beatrice. The old shoes
     Beatrice has placed   on its feet look odd compared to
     the fine uniform.                                                  *

     Hector and Beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of
     their situation, but perhaps it only looks strange to
     our modern eyes.

     Hector continues to bask in her wonderful aroma.
                                HECTOR
                  You've put magic in this stuff,
                  haven't you, you're bewitching
                  me...
     They appear to get the gist of one another's love talk.

                  You're eager today, Hector, aren't
                  you? Is it all this death?
                                HECTOR
                  I don't know what you're saying
                  but I like you when you talk.

75   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                           75

     Hector is watching Beatrice conduct some kind of
     ceremony over the corpse of the squire. She takes a
     handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her
     bag. Mumbling strangely and quickly to herself, she
     walks around the corpse three times, scattering the
     leaves over the body.
     Hector is fascinated, but a little uneasy. He watches
     from a safe distance. During the few moments that it
     takes, Beatrice seems like a different person.
     Then, all of a sudden, the familiar, friendly Beatrice
     returns. She completes her ceremony by throwing a few
     drops of her perfume over the body. She smiles.                    *
                                BEATRICE
                  That should help him a little.

                                HECTOR
                  We should go now. We've been here
                  too long.
                                BEATRICE
                  I wonder if his mama will ever
                  know what happened.

                                HECTOR
                  You said mama. I know what that
                  is... mama... We can talk the
                  same...

     They have reached the summit   of the hills. It is like
     the roof of the world. Below    them lies the valley. The
     air is clean. The landscape    looks untouched by man,
     but a few smudges of smoke in   the distance suggest farms
     or villages. There might be    the glimpse of a castle on
     a hill.

     If it all feels oddly familiar to us, then perhaps it
     is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book, or
     an ancient landscape on a gallery wall. Once again in
     the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not
     from a dream, but in a dream.

     The moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of
     Hector and Beatrice.
                                HECTOR
                  I have to keep the sun on my back,

                  sun on my back all the way home...
                  I'll stay on this side of the
                  river...

                  Yes, of course... we stay on this
                  side of the river, all the way
                  down... until tomorrow...
                                HECTOR

                  Yes... On this side. Then the
                  other.
     They move off, each thinking that they have reached
     agreement. Beatrice starts to sing as they make a                *
     gentle descent into the forests below.


77   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                           77
     Beatrice is milking a stray cow they have found in the
     forest. Hector is watching her, especially her hands.
     She manipulates the udders of the cow deftly, sexily.
     Her hands seem to have sensual personalities all of
     their own. She is chattering non-stop, explaining the            *
     subtleties of milking to Hector. But he can't take
     his eyes or his mind off her thrilling hands. He
     responds distractedly.                                           *

     Hector lies by their small fire, watching Beatrice, who
     sleeps by his side. She is dreaming. She mumbles in
     her sleep, whole sentences. She turns this way and that.
     Hector watches in fascination.

     We feel the echo of another night when a man watched
     someone sleep and dream.

     He handles some of the things spilling from her bag,
     lying beside him. Her dried flowers and herbs, which he
     sniffs, her little bottles and phials. Witches brew? Or
     simply an early version of a cluttered handbag?

     We don't know what is passing through Hector's mind.
     Perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying
     with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his
     side. And how many people have done that through the
     ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms?
     There are many ways in which we will be able to connect
     with this perplexed, flea-ridden man, far away from home,
     huddling by a fire in the forest, trapped in his time, as
     we all are.

79   EXT. FOREST - MORNING                                        79
     Hector and Beatrice are on the move again. They make
     their way down into the thickening forest. Beatrice
     walks ahead, light-footed and humming to herself. She
     seems to be in comfortably familiar territory now. The
     mist swirls about him as Hector follows on behind,
     tagging along as if caught in her sexual wake.


80   EXT. BOAT - DAY                                              80
     Hector and Beatrice have reached the river, broad and
     slow-moving. Beatrice has hailed a boatman from the far
     side. He maneuvers his small boat to them and they
     clamber aboard. Beatrice and the boatman greet each
     other familiarly. They gossip amiably as the ferry makes
     its way across the river. Hector sits quietly with a
     smile on his face, their chatter incomprehensible to him.

81   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             81
     As they climb out of the ferry Hector is suddenly unsure
     of what he is doing.

                                HECTOR
                  I think we're going the wrong way.
                  I want the sun on my back. We
                  should have stayed on the other
                  side.

     He mimes what he means.

                  I'll fix your back for you... give
                  you a good rub.
     Before he can protest she has moved off.        So he follows
     her.

82   EXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY                                    82

     They have reached the outskirts of a village. Beatrice
     turns off the main track and up a narrow path. Hector
     follows her. Soon she stops at a small house close to
     an orchard. The house sits in the mess of a run-down
     farm yard, chickens and goats running here and there.

     Beatrice opens the door of the house and goes inside.
     Hector hesitates before following her.

     Beatrice turns to him when they are inside.
                                BEATRICE
                  Here we are... home... you want
                  some food... and then I'll show
                  you everything. We have a spring
                  ... you can wash...
     Hector stands looking around the small dark room.
     Beatrice suddenly seems shy and awkward.

                                BEATRICE
                  This is when I wish you could
                  understand me. You'll have to
                  learn, you know... I want you to
                  stay here. You want to, don't
                  you?

     Hector looks at her in silence.
                                BEATRICE
                  I look after the hens, and I make                       *
                  dyes from the plants, and perfumes
                  too. I'm good at that. But I'm                          *
                  no good with the sheep and the
                  goats. I wish you could

     She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.

     working trousers and a hide jacket.

                  I still have his clothes.   I'll

     She holds the jacket up against Hector to measure it.
     Hector's reaction to a dead man's clothing is                       *

                  I'm getting shy. Imagine me being
                  shy with you... I made this for
                  him... tonight we'll try them on.
                  You're the same height as Arnaud,
                  but a little thinner. I'll make
                  them fit. I'm a good sewer. And
                  we have a big bed upstairs for
                  you and me, in the rafters... You
                  and me... sleep...
     Hector is beginning to understand what she means, but he
     keeps his feelings to himself. Beatrice talks on. Now
     that she has started, she wants to say it all.

                                BEATRICE
                  I like you. You like me too,
                  don't you? We were lucky to meet
                  the way we did. All the men around
                  here are old.                                          *
     Beatrice falls silent, overtaken     by her shyness. Hector
     understands fully what she means     now, but his mind is
     a confusion. He can't respond.       She tries to direct his
     thoughts to the one area she is     sure about.
                                BEATRICE
                  Come up and I'll show you the bed...
     She climbs a   ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor
     on the wooden   ceiling. Hector climbs up to join her and
     together they   stand on the ladder with their heads poking
     into the tiny   space above.

84   INT. COTTAGE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                             84   *

     Beatrice is proud of her bed, a rough mattress on the
     floor covered in some blankets she has probably made
     herself.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     The bed takes up most of the space of the small attic.
     They look at it together.

                                BEATRICE
                  A good bed, eh? For you and me.
                  We can have fun up here... better
                  than a ditch...

     She laughs. Hector's expression lightens a little too.
     It occurs to him to take up her offer immediately. She               *
     catches his thought, and the moment tingles happily.                 *
     Then from outside they hear voices. Firstly a young Boy
     calling.
                                BOY (O.S.)
                  Mama, are you home?


85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                              85
     Beatrice and Hector   descend back in the room. A BOY
     of about eight and   a GIRL of ten are coming in from the            *
     garden. They have    been working outside. Beatrice goes
     to embrace each of   them. Hector's face is a confusion
     once again.
                                GIRL
                  You were gone a long time.   Who's
                  this?
     The Girl eyes Hector up and down.
                                BEATRICE
                  This is Hector.
     Beatrice pronounces his name with care.      She stands
     proudly by her children.

                                BEATRICE
                  These are my children...

     The CREAK of a door makes Hector turn his head.
                                BEATRICE
                  ... and this is my mother....

     An OLD WOMAN stands in the main doorway, smiling at
     Hector and nodding her head. She speaks to her daughter.
                                MOTHER (OLD WOMAN)
                  So... you found one, eh?

     Hector stands, surrounded by instant family, and doesn't
     know what to do. Eventually he speaks.                               *

                                HECTOR
                  Is there water... to drink... to
                  wash?
     He mimes with his hands. Beatrice understands that he
     wants some breathing space. She talks to her son.

                                BEATRICE
                  Take Hector to the well... but
                  come here first.

     She takes off the dead Squire's shoes and puts them on
     the Boy's bare feet. He is delighted. He does a little
     dance in them before leaving with Hector.


86   EXT. WELL - DAY                                                86
     Hector stands at the well some way from the house.
     Beatrice's garden is a madness of wild flowers, harvested
     by her for scents and powders. She is a remarkable
     woman, living as she does in the harsh male world of
     her time. The scented air and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the
     BEES almost make Hector swoon. He is experiencing the
     full, heady impact of Beatrice, and it is summed up in
     a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze.
     He drinks at   her well. The Boy is beside him, still
     engrossed in   his new shoes. Hector splashes some water
     on his face   and looks back at the house. He has some
     decisions to   make.


87   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                             87
     The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to
     a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. She
     is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to
     watch her. He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The
     Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. In a
     flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions
     for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of
     embarrassment.
                                HECTOR
                  No, no... sit down... I just came
                  to watch... please... sit...
     He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They
     struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows
     Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                MOTHER
                  We can't have this... this was
                  Arnaud's seat... it's yours
                  now... I can sit on the box...
     Hector gently pacifies her.

                                HECTOR
                  You must sit there... look...
                  you need the light from the
                  window... it's your
                  seat... I don't want it... it's
                  yours... I can sit on the box.
     The old woman   allows herself a shy smile. Whether in
     innocence or   mischief, she has secured the best seat in
     the house for   herself. If he stays, Hector will never
     dare rest his   bones in it.

88   EXT. YARD - DAY                                               88
     Hector has retreated to the yard. The Girl is
     boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. The
     Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling
     petals and separating the hearts, putting them in a
     large jar of colored liquid.
     Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him. She is
     returning to the kitchen, firmly holding a struggling
     chicken, wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere.
     This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in
     Beatrice's final effort at total seduction, a wonderful
     meal. Hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes
     meet briefly.
     Hector takes in   what the Boy is doing and joins in
     the work. The    Boy smiles at Hector's initial clumsiness.
     He motions for   Hector to have a sniff of the jar of
     liquid. Hector    does so.  The smell is heady and pleasant.

                               HECTOR
                  Ah...
     The Boy says something and points towards his sister.
     She stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid.
     Hector goes to watch her work. He looks in the cauldron.
                                HECTOR
                  Good color... for cloth?

     Without thinking, Hector leans over the cauldron to
     sniff. A hideous odor assaults him. He backs off.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             69.        *

                               HECTOR
                  Ugh...

     The Girl says something to him, and points to a bucket
     of liquid at her feet. Hector makes out something like
     the word "peepee."

                               HECTOR
                  Peepee?
     The Girl nods enthusiastically.      The Boy is sniggering.

89   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            89

     Hector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family.
     There is an air of awkward silence, although the Boy
     and Girl look openly at Hector, perhaps assessing him as
     a future father.
     The meal has been served in a communal pot. In Beatrice's
     house there is the luxury of small individual plates.
     The others wait for Hector to begin, but he indicates
     to the old Mother to help herself first. She does, and
     she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with
     food. There is definitely some power play going on in
     the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence.
     Hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food.
     The old Mother's appetite is prodigious. It is comical
     to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly
     and methodically. She is an eating machine.
     During the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances. But
     this time their talking without words is a serious affair.
                                HECTOR
                  Mmmm... good food....

90   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            90

     From the kitchen Beatrice watches Hector in the garden.
     he is making an effort to appear relaxed, but as he
     paces here and there Beatrice knows that he is unhappy.
     She leaves the kitchen to join him.

                                BEATRICE
                  Take a walk to the village if
                  you want... you look as if you
                  need a walk...

     Hector opens his heart to her, knowing she will understand
     his feelings if not his words.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                HECTOR
                  I have to leave soon. I can't
                  stay... it would be wrong to stay
                  for just a while...

91   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                                91

     It is awkward for Hector to say goodbye.
                                HECTOR
                  I have to go... have to keep the
                  sun on my back... I have to get
                  home... I have a family, just
                  like you... I like you... you                             *
                  smell good... wonderful...

     Hector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks
     off down the track. He turns to look at Beatrice.
     She stands outside her house for a long time, watching
     him until he turns onto the main road and OUT OF SIGHT.
     The pain and the awkwardness in   Beatrice and Hector
     are specific, but the scene of   parting is timeless.
     Is this the ten millionth such   parting, or the billionth?
     It is one of them at any rate,   and a sad one.


92   EXT. RIVER - DUSK                                                 92
     Hector has reached the river, but it is already growing
     dark and the boatman has gone for the night. Hector
     sees the boat, dragged out of the water.

     He sits down against the trunk of a large tree.       His              *
     eyes begin to close.                                                   *


93   EXT. RAFT - MORNING                                               93
     Hector awakes. He looks around him. He is on a huge                    *
     raft, made of ship's timbers. We have left our previous
     Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. This
     Hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare.
     The huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together.
     There are over a hundred and fifty people perched on
     them, lying or squatting in sleep. It is early morning.
     The sea is calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is
     still there to remind them of their predicament, menacing,
     like a controlled anger.

     Hector is fully awake now, sitting against some boxes.
     He speaks to ANDRE sitting close by.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            71.

93   CONTINUED:                                                   93
     Andre is Hector's   slave, still bound to him in service
     through shipwreck   and disaster. Our Hector is now a
     master. Andre is    a young Asian. A quiet, capable,
     intelligent man,   but with that same lost look in his
     eyes that Hector   had as a slave. He too is far from
     home.

                                HECTOR
                  I had a wonderful dream. I was                       *
                  lying under a tree, beside a river.
                  I was dozing. I heard the water...
                  beautiful clear water. I got up
                  and drank some. I think I ate some                   *
                  raspberries too.

                                ANDRE
                  I would like some water.
     Hector looks around him at the squalid mass of distressed
     humanity.
                                HECTOR                                 *
                  God, this is the worst, the worst.                   *

     Some figures rise and an argument takes place, like
     a domestic squabble. We can hear some of their exchanges.
                                WOMAN
                  Let me keep him... they said we'll
                  find land in a day or so... you're
                  evil...
                                MAN
                  When they're dead they go over the
                  side... The place stinks enough
                  as it is...

     There is a flurry of movement amongst the figures, then
     a splash, then a cry of a Woman. The noise has awakened
     others. All over the raft figures are coming awake,
     sitting up, taking in the new day, and the dreadful
     reality of their situation.
     Andre speaks to Hector.

                                ANDRE
                  Do you think I'll still see
                  Europe?
                                HECTOR
                  I think there's more chance of
                  me eating you, Andre.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             72.

     The more we see     of the people, their costumes, weapons,
     mannerisms, the     easier we will place them in their
     time. They are      survivors of a foundered ship some time
     at the height of     the great colonial empires. The year
     could be 1590.      The place is the Indian Ocean.

     Hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft,
     closer to him. He watches a man and woman. The woman,
     URSULA, still has her eyes closed, sleeping on a pile of
     canvas. The man, FRANCISCO, stands beside her holding
     a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray. His eye
     catches Hector's, and they hold each other's gaze for a
     long time. There is antipathy but also pain in their
     look.                                                              *

     A man, DOM PAULO, moves among the waking wretches.      He
     speaks with authority.
                                DOM PAULO
                  I think today will be the day,
                  my friends. We've been in the
                  inshore currents since yesterday.
                  Three crowns to the first one to
                  sight the coast. God preserve us
                  all.
     Someone speaks from under a crude canvas shelter.
                                SAILOR
                  Never mind the three crowns... a
                  side of beef would do... or a drink
                  of clean water.
     Dom Paulo strides off to his station by the makeshift
     rudder.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Don't worry, there'll be food for
                  all ashore. Africa's full of
                  meat and drink.

                                SAILOR
                  It's full of Africans too.

94   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                               94

     The sun is up, and Dom Paulo was right. The raft is
     now standing off-shore riding out the heavy ocean surf
     before finally beaching. The strong are helping to row
     ashore, under the shouted instructions of the NAVIGATOR.
     Those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses-
     sions, hoping to survive this final trial of the sea.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         73.

94   CONTINUED:                                                 94
     Hector works his oar with the rest. He has time to cast
     a glance at Ursula and Francisco. Francisco in his
     manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time
     trying to offer a steadying arm to Ursula.
     If Hector had time or energy to laugh, he would.

     The raft is in the full rage of the surf. The sense
     behind its loose construction is obvious now. Snake-like
     it rides the waves, one half up, the other down. The
     beaching isn't easy. A few people are washed overboard
     with no way of saving them. Finally the raft makes it
     through the barrier of the outer surf. They are in a
     long curving bay. Up from the beach lies an area of             *
     dunes, and beyond that a thick belt of jungle.

     The raft scrapes onto the sand. Those near the beach
     scramble ashore, immediately prostrating themselves in
     prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into
     the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety.
     Hector's attention is never far from Ursula. She is             *
     struggling in the water with some of her baggage. A
     youth, NUNO, goes to help her. Hector overtakes him and
     nudges him out of the way, offering to take Ursula's load
     from her shoulders. She refuses his help. Waist-deep in         *
     water they tussle over her bundle of possessions. Hector        *
     overpowers her, wrestles her load from her grasp, angrily
     wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand. In amongst
     the drama of their situation their little battle of wills
     seems petty and pathetic, but it reveals much about their
     past.
                                                                     *
     Soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from
     the raft. They have managed to hoard a surprising amount
     from their doomed ship. Carpets, chests, chairs, all
     are dragged ashore.

95   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                            95

     Civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner
     of Africa. Dom Paulo, the leader, already has a table
     and chair set up in the sand, and behind him SAILORS are
     erectig a tent-like house, made from timbers and rich
     tapestries and carpets. The others are making their own
     shelters all along the beach. A regular little community
     is taking shape, a crazy, rich-textured village decked out
     in all the colors of the East. The silks and ginghams
     that were destined for the finest halls in Europe now give
     shelter to sick slaves, starving sailors, ruined traders
     and grieving mothers.

                                                           74.        *

     Some of the survivors have   recovered sufficiently from
     the trauma of near death to   mark out the boundaries of
     their new beach homes with   lines of stones. The habits
     of ownership die hardest of   all.
     Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority he is also a
     man in deep shock. Most of what he has earned or
     plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom
     of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone
     else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command.
     There are probably fifty men among the survivors more
     suited to lead them to safety.
     By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of
     about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his
     father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a
     constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does,
     good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a
     continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy
     Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the
     absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high-
     lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too
     however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's
     compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's
     sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his
     son's eyes.
     Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with
     some of his OFFICERS.
                                DOM PAULO
                  How many made it?
                                OFFICER
                  Eighty men. Ten women. Eighteen
                  children and forty-five slaves.

                                DOM PAULO
                  Two parties of ten men each... one
                  to the north and one to the south...
                  bring back what you can... game,
                  fruit, anything... and send someone
                  back as soon as you find fresh
                  water. Any trouble, discharge
                  three shots.

     The Officer leaves to carry out his orders.    Dom Paulo
     addresses another of his men, Da Cunha.

96   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                96
     Hector and Andre are walking through the half-built
     village.  Andre is carrying Hector's possessions, a
     rolled-up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth. We feel
     an echo of the days when Hector was a slave, walking
     two paces behind with his master's possessions.
     Hector finds what he is looking for. Francisco is
     working on a shelter for himself and Ursula, with the
     help of some slaves. Hector approaches him, making
     another attempt to heal wounds from his past.
                                HECTOR
                  I have a carpet and some cloth...
                  I thought if we worked together
                  we could make a better shelter...
     Francisco barely stops his work to reply.
                                FRANCISCO
                  If it's a joke it's a poor one.                        *
                                HECTOR
                  At least ask Dona Ursula...

                                FRANCISCO
                  I don't have to ask her... I know
                  she would agree with me... leave us
                  alone.
     His stubborn rejection of Hector reveals just how
     strong their friendship once was.

                                HECTOR
                  Well... would you take my cloth,
                  at least?

                                FRANCISCO
                  Keep it and build your own hovel
                  somewhere else... leave us
                  alone...!

     Then from along the beach the sound of RAISED      VOICES
     distracts them. They see some figures, laden       with
     supplies, running off into the forest. Others       are
     following them, discharging MUSKETS, shouting      for the
     DESERTERS to stop. Hector and Francisco walk       briskly
     in the direction of the trouble. They see two       of the
     Deserters being overtaken by their pursuers.       The rest
     make their escape into the jungle.

97   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                97

     Hector and Francisco reach Dom Paulo's office in the
     sand. The leading citizens are gathering there as
     the two captured Deserters are brought in.

                                SAILOR
                  They ran off with the dry bread...                     *
                  about eight of them, sir...                            *
     Dom Paulo looks at the two prisoners.
                                DOM PAULO
                  You men are deserters. You will
                  die tomorrow.
     He speaks again to the Sailor.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Chain them on the raft for tonight,
                  and watch them...
     Francisco steps forward, outraged.

                                FRANCISCO
                  I must object... these sentences
                  can't be lawful...

     Dom Paulo's authoritative manner vanishes in an instant.
     He becomes hesitant, unsure of himself. As always, his              *
     Son watches every detail of the exchange.                           *

                                DOM PAULO
                  Do you think so?

                                FRANCISCO
                  Of course... we can't allow
                  ourselves to fall into terror
                  and violence...

                                DOM PAULO
                  You're right... but then how can
                  we punish them? We can't lock them
                  up...

     Dom Paulo looks around at the assembled notables,
     confused, out of his depth. Other opinions are voiced.

                  You were right the first time,

                  mouths...
     The captured Deserters look on helplessly as their lives
     are argued over.

                                YOUNG DESERTER
                  I didn't steal any bread... Gomes
                  had the bread... he's off, in the
                  forest...

     Dom Paulo turns to the Priest.

                  What do you think, Father?
     The Priest throws open his arms noncommittally.
                                PRIEST
                  I'll comfort them whether they

                  So I was right the first time?

     Francisco confuses him even more.

                  It was Gomes... he told us to run.

                                DOM PAULO
                  I'll decide... no I won't... we'll
                  all decide... most of the people
                  that matter are here... we'll have
                  a vote... who agrees with
                  Salgado... and me... that they
                  should die?
     A lot of hands go up. Hector hesitates, his instincts
     are not for killing. But the force of the majority
     weighs on him. He starts to raise his hand. At that
     moment, as he scans the crowd, he meets the eyes of the
     Deserter whose death they are voting on. For a moment
     they communicate. Hector is thrown. He drops his hand,
     only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of
     Salgado on him. He hesitates again, then starts to
     raise his hand. Then the eyes of the Deserter find him
     once more. This comic pantomime goes on while a solid
     majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands.
                                DOM PAULO
                  ... and those against death...

     One of the Deserters raises his own hand meekly.
                                DOM PAULO
                  You can't vote...

     Then he looks to Salgado.
                               DOM PAULO
                  Can he?

                  It doesn't matter.

     Then the other Deserter raises his hand too.
                                SALGADO
                  I don't think this is working,
                  Dom Paulo... we need authority...
                  you must decide...
     Dom Paulo thinks.

                  it into a scaffold... have it
                  erected along the beach, away
                  from the women... the executions
                  will be at sunrise tomorrow. Tell
                  Father Diogo.

     He turns to the Sailors holding the Deserters.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Take them to the raft.

     The dazed Deserters are led off.       Dom Paulo's face clouds
     in doubt again.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Everyone in agreement with hanging?                    *
                  Or should we shoot them... or what?
                                DA CUNHA
                  Hanging is fine, sir.
                                                                         *
                                DOM PAULO
                  Very well... now... who's going
                  to conduct the executions... should
                  we pick someone, or have a
                  volunteer...
     Dom Paulo looks over the faces of the men.       He stops at
     Hector.
                               DOM PAULO
                  Hector?

     Hector doesn't have the will to accept or the courage to            *
     refuse. He is saved by another young man, ALVAREZ, eager
     to prove himself.

                                ALVAREZ
                  I'll do it, Dom Paulo.

                                DOM PAULO
                  Thank you, Alvarez. Sunrise
                  tomorrow. Send the Priest to
                  them tonight.

     We can sense the feeling of relief in Hector. Dom                   *
     Paulo's son has been a silent witness to everything that            *

     It is growing dark. Fires are being lit outside     the
     shelters. Andre is building Hector's tent while     Hector
     watches him. The tent is only large enough for     one
     person, and somehow looks mean compared with the    others.
                             HECTOR
               Good work, Andre.

     He looks across to the well-made shelter of Ursula and
     Francisco. Ursula herself works at the fire.
                                                                        *
     Hector turns to Andre.
                             HECTOR
               You go and sleep by the big fire,
               Andre. Keep warm.

     Andre leaves.

99   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                             99
     Hector goes inside his little    house. He puts his back
     to the entrance and opens the    canvas sack which contains
     all his possessions. He pulls     out his prize, a sizeable
     chunk of bread and some dried    fruit. He guiltily gnaws
     at the hard bread.
     He is surprised by the sound of the boy, Nuno outside.
                               NUNO
               Senor Hector?
     Hector quickly stows his food back into his sack, and
     with a grunt of irritation sticks his head out of the
     shelter.

     Nuno is holding four fruits, about the size of large
     apples, but green and thick-skinned.
                             NUNO
               This was all they found in the
               forest. Four for each of us.
               They taste kind of milky, but
               sour.

                             HECTOR
               Thank you, Nuno.
                             NUNO
               My mother ate three and she was
               sick. So try two... but she's
               sick anyway... maybe you can try
               three...

                                                  (CONTINUED)

99   CONTINUED:                                                     99
                                HECTOR
                  I'll start with two.

     Nuno makes to leave, but then hesitates.
                                NUNO
                  Hector, will you help me?

     Nuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the
     raft on the shoreline. The shapes of the two Deserters
     chained there can just be seen.

                                NUNO
                  Lopo... the boy they're going to
                  hang tomorrow... he was cook's
                  cabin boy... I was going to take                       *
                  him something to eat... I thought,
                  perhaps, one of yours and one of
                  mine...
     He looks at the fruit he has just given Hector.
                                NUNO
                  You said you might just eat two...
                                HECTOR
                  But there's tomorrow, Nuno... we
                  must eat tomorrow too...

     Nuno looks disappointed. His eyes turn again to his
     playmate tied to the raft.
                                HECTOR
                  Dom Paulo would call it a waste.
                  You must keep yourself strong, Nuno,
                  that's what he'd say... so that you
                  can help the others... God knows
                  what we have ahead of us... we'll
                  need strong people like you...
     Nuno is silent, unconvinced.

                                HECTOR
                  Try not to think about Lopo any
                  more... The guards wouldn't let
                  you near him anyway.

     Nuno stomps away in silence.       Hector shouts after him
     cheerily.

                               HECTOR
                  Goodnight!

                                                          82.         *

100   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                         100
      In the privacy of their tent Dom Paulo and his son are
      engaged in their nightly ritual, practicing on their
      recorders. Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an
      intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is
      an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are
      to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of
      circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness
      about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of
      what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are
      waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend
      of formality and madness make the scene comic.

101   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                          101

      The sun has risen sharply, soaring out of the ocean. It
      blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party
      making their way along the beach.
      The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the
      camp. Most people are  attending to their morning
      chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being
      carried out along the shore.

      Our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the
      camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form-
      ality of legal death. The priest and the executioners.
      It takes a while for the people in the camp to become
      aware of the other observers up on the dunes. Three
      figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching
      the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold.
      The word passes around the camp. Eyes pass between the
      executions and the tall natives watching.   The first man
      is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo
      and his officers are discussing the appearance of the
      natives.
                               DA CUNHA
                 Some gunpowder would scatter them,
                 sir.
                               DOM PAULO
                 No, they might want to be
                 friendly... they'll have food
                 too... get one of our African
                 slaves... we must try and talk to
                 them... If they think we're timid
                 we're dead.

                                                           83.

102   EXT. DUNES - DAWN                                           102
      A solitary SLAVE makes his way up from the camp to the
      natives on the dunes. Everyone in the camp watches as he
      approaches them. There is tension. Will the natives run
      or fight or talk. They begin to talk. The natives seem
      most interested in the hangings, and point in that
      direction, asking questions. The Slave makes an attempt
      at explaining what is happening, but the natives seem
      baffled. They start laughing and shaking their heads.
      By now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the
      cross making an efficient double-gallows.


103   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                            103
      While Francisco's attention has been on the natives,
      Hector has sidled up to him, still hoping to ingratiate
      himself. He talks while they watch the two events, the
      hanging and the meeting.
                              HECTOR
                I hate it when people have to die.                      *
                              FRANCISCO
                It's foolishness. Killing our
                own men when we have the whole of
                Africa to face.
                              HECTOR
                It's foolish squabbling at all.
                We should be friends.
      Francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is
      saying. Hector shrugs. He takes a small bundle from
      his jacket and gives it to Francisco.
                               FRANCISCO
                What's this?

                              HECTOR
                Some bread and raisins.

                              FRANCISCO
                I thought everything was shared
                out on the raft...

                              HECTOR
                Well this wasn't. It's for her...
                and you.
      Francisco looks Hector straight  in the eye, looking for
      his angle. But this time there   is none. Hector is
      simply a lonely man seeking to  retrieve lost friendship.
      There is a glimmer of sympathy  in Francisco's face.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              84.

      On the high dunes the Slave and the natives have now
      parted company. The Deserters still spin at the end of
      their ropes, the Priest praying at their feet.
      Francisco walks away from him.      Hector calls out.

                                 HECTOR
                   I must speak to her!

104   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                               104

      The Slave approaches Dom Paulo outside his tent.
                                 SLAVE
                   They want to make a visit here...
                   with their King... he will bring
                   gifts, and will receive gifts.
                   They said not to sacrifice anymore                     *
                   men for them... they don't like
                   that...
      Dom Paulo and the others laugh.

105   EXT. BAY - DAY                                                105
      The tide is sweeping more wreckage into the bay. Barrels
      and boxes and timber bob in the waves. People make their
      way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the
      sea.                                                                *
      The whole of the camp is eager and shouting. They bring             *
      in the boxes and barrels. A whole harmonium is man-
      handled ashore. Some boys drag it up onto dry sand and
      start to work its bellows. At first only water spurts
      from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. The
      mood soon becomes festive. Dom Paulo makes his way down             *
      to the shore to make the celebrations official.                     *
      By now the first of the newly-arrived crates are being
      opened. Inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in
      crate after crate.
      An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo.

                                 OFFICER
                   Turtles' eggs, sir... Doctor Correa
                   was shipping them to the Royal
                   Zoo... I think they hoped some of
                   them would hatch.

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Well... it's eggs for supper
                   tonight... for everyone...                             *

                                                           85.

      That night everyone does eat turtles' eggs. At their
      fires in the dusk they fry them, boil them, scramble
      them. Some eat them raw. The abundant green fruits
      make a tolerable side dish. The happy mood of the
      afternoon has survived into the night. For once there
      is enough to eat, and the hangings are a thing of the
      past. Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF
      the CROAKY sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be
      heard.                                                           *

107   INT. HECTOR'S TENT - DUSK                                  107
      Sadly for Hector, the harmonium enthusiast is very close
      to his shelter. The JANGLY MUSIC is loud and insistent.
      Hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them
      outside to his fire.


108   EXT. CAMP - DUSK                                           108
      Andre is there eating the last of his omelette.
                                HECTOR
                How are they?
                                ANDRE
                Good.

      Hector cracks one of his eggs into a copper pan. Inside          *
      is a brown smudge of dried yoke and some dust. Hector            *
      grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg. The yoke is
      discolored and the smell is rank. Hector looks at Andre,
      rapidly finishing his omelette before Hector can demand          *
      it.
                              HECTOR
                Yours were fine?
                                ANDRE
                Yes.

      Hector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his
      ear. It seems as empty as the other two.  He picks up
      a fourth egg and cracks it open. A small dried-up, half-
      formed baby turtle RATTLES into the pan. Andre is
      quietly enjoying Hector's frustration. He stands up to
      leave.
                                ANDRE
                Good night.

                   The slaves only got three.    I want
                   to ask you something.

                                 HECTOR
                   You were lucky. What?
                                 ANDRE
                   I want my real name back.
                                 HECTOR
                   You don't like Andre anymore?

                                 ANDRE
                   I think of my home all the time.
                   I want to hear the name they call
                   me. We should die with our real
                   names.
                                 HECTOR
                   We're not going to die, Andre...
      Hector smiles at his own insensitivity.
                                 HECTOR
                   I've forgotten your name...
                                 ANDRE
                   Ketabomago Pululo.
                                 HECTOR
                   Now I remember why we called you
                   Andre.

      Andre looks at him expectantly.
                                 HECTOR
                   I will, Andre... I promise... I'll
                   call you that... when I remember...
      Andre is satisfied, and leaves.      Hector calls to him.

                                 HECTOR
                   Good night... Keta...
                                 ANDRE
                   Ketabomago Pululo...

                                 HECTOR
                   Yes... good night...

      Hector is alone. Hector gives up on the eggs and pulls               *
      out his store of bread and fruit from the tent. The                  *
      next source of annoyance is the continuing noise of the
      HARMONIUM.
      He shouts across to the musical enthusiast, a YOUTH
      with a few older children by his side.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hey! Stop that, will you? Think
                   of the older people, and the
                   sick... I'll give you an egg if                         *
                   you stop... here...
                                                                           *

109   EXT. CAMP - NEXT MORNING                                       109

      The Officers and Dom Paulo are selecting items for barter            *
      from their crates and boxes of valuables. Hector and
      other notables are also there.
      Cheap goods, a box of rosaries and crucifixes made of                *
      common beads, for example, are being gone through and
      suitable junk selected for gifts.
      They talk as they work.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   How many are sick?
                                 DA CUNHA
                   About fifty, sir, some of them
                   very sick indeed. It's the eggs.
                   A couple of the crates were full of                     *
                   rotten ones, but eaten just the                         *
                   same. Others just ate too many.
                   It would have been better to ration
                   them, I suppose.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   How wise of you to think of that
                   now. Any deaths?
                                DA CUNHA
                   Six.

                                 DOM PAULO
                   How many eggs did you have?

                   Three.   I had them boiled.

                                  DOM PAULO
                   I had four.   I don't feel well
                   now...

                                 DA CUNHA
                   Four's all right... the really ill
                   ones had eaten eight, ten...

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Let's not think about it... what                        *

      Salgado comes forward with a handful of the broken
      remains of a kettle. Copper is a useful currency.
                                 SALGADO
                   It worked well... they'll go for
                   this... and nails... Luis cleaned
                   up a sackful from the crates...
      Salgado shows a handful of nails from a small sack in his
      hand.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   Organize some men to gather all                         *
                   the nails they can find. We have
                   to keep control of that particular
                   currency.
      Dom Paulo rummages in a box of cheap rosaries, selects a
      couple, and then retires to his tent. The others work
      on at the table. Hector drifts off down to the beach.


110   INT. DOM PAULO'S TENT - MORNING                                110
      Inside his tent Dom Paulo goes to his small mirror. He
      takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from
      around his neck, and a valuable brooch from his coat. He
      stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its
      hiding place in the sand floor. Then he adorns himself
      in the cheap rosary and other trashy items. Dom Paulo,               *
      catching sight of his watching Son in the mirror, holds              *
      a silencing finger to his mouth.                                     *

111   EXT. BEACH - MORNING                                           111

      Hector is walking along the beach, close to a pile of                *
      discarded boxes and crates.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            89.

111   CONTINUED:                                                   111
      He quickly searches through them. He soon finds what he            *
      is looking for, a piece of wood with some nails still
      attached to it. He pulls out the nails and pockets them,
      then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more.
      Hector is a survivor. And not the first Hector to
      scavenge on a beach, in a world that feels big and empty.


112   EXT. DUNES - MORNING                                         112
      Hector is enjoying the   freshness of the day. We see              *
      him climb over a dune   and then as he nears the summit
      duck and retreat down   the slope again. Cautiously he
      crawls up the dune and   looks over to the other side.

      He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno. They are
      twelve or thirteen years old. They are coyly in the
      early stages of making love, the Boy lying close to the
      Girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. Their                  *
      love-making is poised oddly between child's play and               *
      eroticism. It's their day of discovery and it is like
      a dream of love.
      The Boy is just about to   discover some more and is
      fumbling with the Girl's   clothing, when he looks up and
      catches sight of Hector.    Hector ducks down but knows he
      has been seen and decides   to brazen it out. He stands
      up in full view of them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Stop that... leave her alone...
                   get back to the camp... or I'll tell
                   your mother... how can you play like
                   this when there are people needing
                   your help back there...?
      The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. He walks
      off back to the camp. The Girl remains sitting in the
      sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise
      her head to Hector.

      Then Hector is touched by something, perhaps the sad stoop
      in the Boy's shoulder or the Girl's lowered head. Hector
      realizes he has broken something precious and in their
      circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable. He
      feels like an oaf. He calls after the Boy.

                                 HECTOR
                   Come back... I didn't mean it...
                   it was a joke... you come back...
                   she's still here... I won't say
                   anything...
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               90.

      But the Boy walks on, turning around now and then to look
      at Hector, who feels foolish and mean. Hector calls down
      to the Girl.
                                HECTOR
                   I'm sorry.

      But she doesn't look up, still fumbling with her buttons.
      Hector curses quietly and looks out across the dunes,
      angry with himself. Then he sees the procession of the               *
      Native King and his people, some cattle, and porters
      carrying baskets.
      Hector runs off towards the camp.


113   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                            113
      The meeting of the two leaders is weird and wonderful                *
      to see. The ragged Europeans, already scanning the                   *
      baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food,
      somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own                    *
      importance for the occasion. The Natives, excited and                *
      curious, trying to contain their exuberance so that they             *
      don't miss a single detail of this most significant
      day. Many of the Natives have climbed into the trees,                *
      either out of timidity or to get a better view                       *

      The trees around the meeting place are dripping with
      bodies, like human fruit.
      Hector slips into the crowd as the NATIVE KING is in
      mid-speech. When he has stopped talking the Slave begins
      to haltingly translate.
                                 SLAVE
                   He was excited when he heard you
                   had come, but he wants to know
                   if you are real people... he
                   didn't think you would be such
                   a strange color... so he wants
                   to see your...
      He points repeatedly at his navel.                                   *

                                 SLAVE
                   ... so that he will know that you
                   were born like real people...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            91.

113   CONTINUED:                                                   113
      Dom Paulo won't suffer the indignity alone.    He talks to
      the Officers standing closest to him.

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Right... you four as well...

      He begins to open up his coat and shirt. The four
      Officers do the same. The King and a few of his atten-
      dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed
      white European bellies. They look at one another and
      mumble solemnly. Then they step back. Dom Paulo and the
      Officers fix their clothing and re-muster their dignity.
      The King is enjoying himself.    He speaks again to the
      Slave, who then translates.

                                 SLAVE
                   He wants to see you breathe.
      The King takes a deep breath, then nods to Dom Paulo.
      Dom Paulo and the Officers do as they are told. The King
      joins them, and for a few moments there is a kind of
      communion between them. Then everyone joins in. It is a            *
      strange, poignant moment, all the Natives and all the
      Europeans united in the simple act of breathing.
      Dom Paulo regains his composure.    He speaks to the Slave.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   Tell him that we want to trade
                   with him, to buy food... and we
                   want him to guide us out of here...
                   we have a long way to travel... to
                   where the white men have their
                   big ships...
      The Slave speaks to the King. The King listens and talks
      back for a long time. Then the Slave translates again.
                                 SLAVE
                   He has heard of white men very,                       *
                   very far away... this way...
                   but you have to cross many rivers...
                   twenty big rivers...

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Tell him I want to give him these...
      Dom Paulo steps forward to the King. An Officer brings             *
      a wrapped cloth. Dom Paulo opens it, letting the King
      see the pieces of broken copper inside.
                                                                         *

      The Officer produces a handful of large nails and
      gives them directly to the King. The King nods his
      head in approval and shows the nails to his attendants.
      They are impressed.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   ... and tell him that I want to
                   make him a very special gift as
                   one King to another...
      Various Officers raise their eyebrows at this.

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Of these precious things, which my
                   fathers and forefathers have worn
                   for many long years before...

      Dom Paulo solemnly and without a blush removes the cheap
      rosary from around his neck and offers it to the King.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   I shouldn't do this, but it is
                   such a special occasion, and he is
                   such a great and worthy King...
      This is translated.    The King refuses to accept the               *
      rosary. Instead he    is pointing to a couple of chunky
      and valuable-looking   rings on Dom Paulo's fingers which
      he has forgotten to   remove.

                   He says he could not accept such
                   a treasured gift, something of
                   such value to your family...
                   instead he would be happy to take
                   one or two of the old rings you have
                   on your fingers... but please do
                   not insist that he take your
                   necklace...
      It is impossible to know if the King is being naively
      polite or hugely clever. Dom Paulo's Officers enjoy a
      muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and
      gives them to the King, replacing the worthless baubles
      around his own neck. The King begins talking again.
      The Slave translates.

                   Thank you, thank you...

      The Slave continues.
                                 SLAVE
                   ... and he asks you to be ready
                   to leave the beach in two days
                   time... he cannot permit you to
                   stay longer...

      Dom Paulo looks shocked.
                                 SLAVE
                   Because with the new moon the
                   turtles will arrive and lay
                   their eggs... you may frighten
                   them... you must be gone...
      The mention of turtles' eggs almost turns the stomachs
      of most of the survivors, even the fit ones.
      The King and his followers walk back into the forest.               *
      Soon the survivors are alone again, with the lost-
      looking cow the Natives have left. A doomed cow if
      ever there was.


114   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                          114
      The remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large
      fire the survivors have made on the beach. Small groups
      of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted flesh.
      The image is once again timeless, the elements of it
      simple; man, fire, flesh, food.
      One cow doesn't go far between a hundred starving people.
      Some are still on their feet by the large fire. Now and
      then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a
      bone hanging loose or a tasty-looking piece of gristle.
      They are the survivors of the pack, if any will be.

      Hector is, of course, among them. He    risks the searing
      heat to pull at a couple of blackened   bones. He sees
      Nuno, the boy he chased away from the   Girl earlier in
      the day. Nuno is sitting by himself,    staring vacantly
      at the fire, licking his fingers.
      Hector sits down in the sand beside him. Nuno hardly
      notices him until Hector offers him one of his bones.
      Nuno grabs it.

                                NUNO
                   Thanks.

                                 HECTOR
                   Suck out the marrow... it's the
                   best bit.
      Nuno follows Hector's example. Hector allows him to
      feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'm sorry about today...
                                 NUNO
                   It doesn't matter...
                                 HECTOR
                   But it does... it was mean of
                   me... I was upset at something...
                   I wasn't really angry at you...
                                 NUNO
                   I know.
      Nuno is taking it rather well.      Hector regains his
      natural self-confidence.                                             *
                                                                           *
                                 HECTOR
                   You don't think too badly of me?
                                 NUNO
                   No...
                                 HECTOR
                   You still like me?
      Nuno shyly nods his head.
                                                                           *
                                 HECTOR
                   You do?

                                 NUNO
                   Yes.

      Hector is satisfied now.
                                 HECTOR
                   Well, that makes me feel better...
                   we all have to like each other...
                   and respect each other... that's
                   important too.
      They are silent for a moment.

                                 HECTOR
                   If you don't respect me, just
                   say so...

      Nuno looks at him, smiling weakly. Then he turns away
      in silence. Hector tries another approach to win the
      Boy over.
                                 HECTOR
                   I have a boy like you... maybe                          *
                   you could meet him when we get
                   home...
      This doesn't produce much of a response. Hector tries
      again. He starts to chuckle to himself and nudges Nuno
      in the ribs.
                                 HECTOR
                   You can take her back there
                   tomorrow, eh?

      Nuno shakes his head.
                                 NUNO
                   No... she's sick now...

      Dom Paulo and the Priest and some of the Officers are
      having a more formal meal at Dom Paulo's table outside
      his shelter. An argument is in progress between Dom
      Paulo and GASPAR DIAS, the navigator.
      Gasper Dias has drawn a rough map which lies on the
      table.
                                                                           *
                                 DOM PAULO
                   Can't you be more accurate?
      Hector comes to the meeting. He sits down on a box
      near the table and watches and listens, his expression
      changing with the shifts in mood of the others. This                 *
      is Hector the social animal, our Hector with his pockets             *
      full of stolen nails and his tent full of stashes of
      food.
                                 DIAS
                   How can I be accurate without
                   instruments? As it is I'm
                   sighting the sun with two pieces
                   of wood... Call it five hundred
                   and be done with it... he said                          *

                                 DOM PAULO
                   We just want you to be as accurate
                   as we know you can be, Dias. After
                   all, the ship did manage to find
                   that rock with admirable precision.

                                 DIAS
                   Confound you, Dom Paulo, that's an
                   insult... she hit that rock because
                   she was taking water and
                   unsteerable... She was overloaded
                   before she left India and you know
                   it....
      Dias pounds his fist on the table.

                                   DIAS
                   I've told   you... we vote for a                         *
                   leader or   you can walk into the
                   jungle on   your own... it should
                   have been   done days ago...
                                 DA CUNHA
                   Calm down, Dias... you can't stay
                   here forever, living on turtles'
                   eggs...
      There are mock groans and laughter at the thought of it.
      The tension for the moment is broken.                                 *
                                 DA CUNHA
                   What about the sick and the
                   injured, Dom Paulo...?

      Dom Paulo lets out a heavy sigh.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   I've discussed it with Father
                   Diogo... I don't see how a hundred
                   of us can carry seventy sick...

                                 FATHER DIOGO
                   I'm going to search the scriptures
                   tonight. I'm sure that God has
                   an answer to it.

                                 DIAS
                   An excuse, you mean... we'll be
                   leaving them here to die...

                                 SALGADO

                                 DIAS

                   It might be the best we can offer

                   good Christian death here, and set
                   an example to the heathens...

      Hector is   making his way in the dark back to his shelter.
      He passes   close to the tent of Francisco and Ursula.
      Francisco   is outside, by the fire. An impulse takes
      Hector to   join him.
                                 HECTOR
                   I'll be glad when we're on the
                   move... the sound of the sea is
                   driving me mad.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Good night, Hector...
      Hector lingers.

                                 HECTOR
                   Where is Ursula? Sleeping?
                                 FRANCISCO
                   Sick. She hasn't been able to
                   rise since yesterday.
                                                                           *
      Hector's face expresses his shock. From what he has
      heard at the meeting this is serious news. He makes a
      decision. He speaks to Francisco, willing their old
      friendship back into existence in the urgency of the
      moment.

                                 HECTOR
                   Will you share a bottle of wine
                   with me? I've had it since we
                   left the ship... I want to drink
                   it tonight, with you.
      This offer has found a chink in Francisco's armor.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   You have a bottle of wine?

      Hector has returned with his precious bottle. Francisco
      by some miracle has two fine crystal glasses. As they
      drink they begin to reveal a hint of their old intimacy.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   You should hang for this. Some
                   people on the raft might have
                   lived with a glass of this in
                   their stomach...
      Francisco sips the wine with the relish of long
      abstinence.
                                 HECTOR
                   I know. I feel very guilty.    I
                   brought this too...

      Hector pulls a cotton bag from under his coat.

                                 HECTOR
                   Honeyed fruit. The last I have.
      Francisco can't believe such food still exits.       He
      smiles in anticipation.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   You rogue... give it here...

      Francisco grabs at the bag and stuffs two or three
      sweets into his mouth, not so much the gentleman now.

                                 HECTOR
                   I brought it for Ursula...
      Francisco talks through his munching.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Much too rich for her... do you want
                   to kill her?

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Don't argue with me, old friend...
                   you're the guilty one around here,
                   and don't you forget it.
                                 HECTOR
                   Why is it always me? Why am I
                   always guilty, always sorry... am
                   I so bad?
                                   FRANCISCO
                   With   Ursula you weren't bad, you
                   were   stupid... you did the one thing
                   you   can't do to a strong woman...
                   you   took away her pride... what else
                   can   she do but hate you?

      Hector is silent.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   And then you get on the same ship...
                   what a fool...
                                 HECTOR
                   I had to get home... just like you...
                                 FRANCISCO
                   And when the ship went down... why
                   did you have to get on the same
                   raft... it was as if you were trying
                   to torment her...
                                 HECTOR
                   But... the other raft was sinking...

      Francisco's face breaks into a smile. They drink the                *
      rest of the bottle in silence, the complexity of their              *
      friendship having gone beyond words.                                *

118   EXT. MASS - DAY                                               118

      On a headland overlooking the bay, Father Diogo's mass is
      in progress. Every fit member of the camp is there, and
      a good many of the sick have been carried in litters to
      take part. The harmonium has been carried up the hill
      and is in full voice, some youths dissipating their
      precious energy on its bellows. The younger boys have
      been organized into a choir.

      The large cross stands behind Father Diogo, held     in place
      by a cairn of piled stones at its base. When we      FIND
      Hector there is something tantalizingly familiar     about it
      all; the cliffs, the ocean, the kneeling Hector,     a pile
      of stones, the offering to a god.
                                                                           *

119   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                           119
      The natives have gathered nearby. They have been moved,              *
      perhaps by the music, or perhaps by the simple, universal            *
      posture of worship itself. They begin to sing, a low,
      rhythmic, compelling chant. It mingles with the distant
      voice of Father Diogo, and then with the chanting voices
      of all the Europeans, until it seems that the whole
      world is praying.


120   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                           120
      Next morning the camp on the beach     is being broken up.
      The place is like a junkyard. The      amount of damage that
      a hundred and fifty people can do     to a beach in two days
      is impressive. Dom Paulo and the      officers watch the work.
      With them are some messengers from     the king, and the
      Slave translator.
      One of the messengers is talking.     When he finishes, the
      Slave translates.
                                 SLAVE
                   Yes... they will look after the
                   sick... but the King would like
                   one thing... the machine that
                   makes music...
                                 DOM PAULO
                   We need food as well... ten
                   cows... to take with us... then
                   the King can have the music.


121   EXT. CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - MORNING                           121    *
      Hector is sitting beside Nuno on a box, talking earnestly
      to him. Andre stands beside them.

                   That's why I have to stay.

                   Follow you and the others.
                                 HECTOR
                   Alone?

      Nuno remains silent.

                   Let him be.


122   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                               122
      Dom Paulo and Father Diogo are standing beside Dom                    *
      Paulo's table, all that remains of his headquarters on                *
      the beach.

                                 FATHER DIOGO
                   I'll comfort them as best as I
                   can.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   You're staying with them?
      Father Diogo hastens to correct this misunderstanding.

                                 FATHER DIOGO
                   No, no, I'll comfort them before
                   we leave. I think my place is
                   with you...
      Two sailors, like stagehands, enter and remove the table,
      leaving Dom Paulo and Father Diogo propless on the beach.


123   EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY                                        123
      The trek from the beach to the village has started. A
      long line of people, including some local natives, carry
      the sick in crudely-made litters. Even this short trip
      is hard.  Somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the
      harmonium up the jungle path.

      Just behind   them Hector is helping Nuno to carry his
      Mother in a   litter. It is like a civilization on the
      move. In a    day or two the wind and the sea will have
      rubbed out   all evidence of their stay, and the bay will
      welcome its   regular tenants, the turtles.


124   EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - DAY                                   124
      There is a sense of bustle in the native village as the
      European sick are settled into their huts and the others
      prepare to depart. Emotional farewells take place in                *
      dark corners of the small huts. A group of unmoved
      sailors are playing cards in the dirt.                              *

      In amongst the bustle Hector is looking for Francisco.
      He finds him taking some of his possessions into a hut.             *
                                 HECTOR
                   Francisco... I have to see her                         *
                   before we leave.
                                   FRANCISCO
                   I'll ask her.
      Francisco goes into the hut. Hector waits outside,
      watching the small human dramas all around him. Soon
      Francisco emerges from the hut.

                                   FRANCISCO
                   In you go.
      Hector goes into the hut, stooping low at the small
      entrance.


125   INT. HUT - DAY                                              125

      Ursula is lying in a darkened corner. Hector is shaken
      by the sight of her, ashen and fevered, but tries not to
      show it. He kneels beside her.

                                 HECTOR
                   Ursula... it's Hector.

      She turns her eyes to him but doesn't speak.

                                 HECTOR
                   We're leaving soon. I've come to
                   say goodbye...

      Her voice is a whisper.

                   forget India... I can't forget
                   how I hurt you...

      She looks at him but doesn't or cannot speak.
                                 HECTOR
                   We should have talked... I could
                   have explained... many things...
      She manages a whispered word.

                                  URSULA
                   Lisbon...
                                 HECTOR
                   Yes... I'll pray for you in
                   Lisbon... at the Cathedral...
      She lies still.       Hector lingers for a moment.   Then he
      speaks again.
                                 HECTOR
                   I'm sorry I hurt your pride...

      Hector has blown it. Ursula pulls herself up on an
      elbow, finding wells of energy from sheer indignation.
      Hector is astonished, almost jumping out of his skin.
                                 URSULA
                   What? What did you say?    What are
                   you talking about?

                                 HECTOR
                   Nothing, nothing...
      Ursula speaks one word, and then falls back into a dead
      faint.
                                  URSULA
                   Idiot!

      She lies still. Hector leans over her to make sure she
      is still breathing. He whispers nervously.
                                  HECTOR
                   Ursula?

                                                            104.

126   EXT. HUT - DAY                                             126
      Outside the hut, Dom Paulo is talking with Francisco.

                              DOM PAULO
                We won't forget you, or what you
                are doing for these poor people...

                              FRANCISCO
                I'm not staying here with the
                intention of dying, Dom Paulo...
                we'll be following you... when we
                are fit and well...

                ... and good luck to you...                            *
      They make what they both know is their final parting.            *
                              DOM PAULO
                God protect you... it breaks my                        *
                heart to leave you all here, but
                I don't know what else I can do.
      They shake hands.
                              DOM PAULO
                We're leaving the cross with
                you...
                              FRANCISCO
                Oh, thank you...

                              DOM   PAULO
                It's too heavy to   carry... and who
                knows... it might   make some
                impression on the   heathens.
      Hector comes out of the hut, solemn-faced.                       *

                              HECTOR
                Francisco, I must talk to you

127   EXT. HUT - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                             127
      Hector takes Francisco by the arm and leads him behind
      the hut.

                                 HECTOR
                   Is there anything that I can do
                   for you? A letter... a message?                           *
      Francisco laughs softly.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   No... if you were carrying                                *
                   something for me I would have to
                   worry about you... if you go
                   empty-handed I can put you out of
                   my mind!
      Hector smiles uncertainly, unsure if Francisco is making
      a joke. Then he becomes more serious.
                                 HECTOR
                   I want to ask you something.                              *
                   There's no easy way to do it...
                                 FRANCISCO
                   Go on, Hector...

                                   HECTOR
                   Your boots...
      Francisco looks down at his boots.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   What about them?

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I have them? You can have
                   mine... they'll be fine for
                   here... but I have to walk six
                   hundred miles...
      Hector lifts a foot to show Francisco his boot. Francisco
      is stunned into silence. But then a smile comes to his                 *
      face.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Yes, you're right... I daresay                            *
                   my boots would take you six hundred                       *
                   miles... I look after them...

      Hector becomes almost poetic in his pleading.

                   I'll walk all the way home,
                   Francisco... I'll pray for your
                   soul in the Cathedral in Lisbon...

                                HECTOR
                   Yes.

      Francisco starts to laugh out loud.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   Hector, you have surpassed
                   yourself... sit down and take my
                   boots!
      Francisco starts to take off his boots. Hector does the             *
      same. He can't believe his luck. At this moment, he                 *
      loves Francisco. He makes nonsensical small talk,
      hopping around on one foot.
                                 HECTOR
                   They were made by Da Fosca,
                   weren't they?
      Francisco is giggling now.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   The best bootmaker in Goa... pray
                   for my soul in Lisbon, Hector...
                   and pray for your own...

      Francisco is laughing, but Hector doesn't get the joke.
                                                                          *

128   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                             128
      A different forest. A wilderness of giant pines, ranging
      through the mountains for hundred of miles. It is late              *
      in the year. There is one human sound in the cold still-            *
      ness, a voice singing.
      BOBBY, the owner of the voice, has a pack on his back.              *
      He is making his way up a steep slope to an area of flat
      ground. He stops singing, looks around, and calls out               *
      in a powerful voice.                                                *
                                 BOBBY
                   They've gone... long gone!

      Bobby looks around the abandoned camp, the dead fires,              *
      cleared areas for tents.

      Up the slope and INTO VIEW comes his companion, leading
      a laden pack horse. It is Hector.

                                  HECTOR
                   How long?

                                 BOBBY
                   They've been gone a week, at
                   least.
                                  HECTOR
                   Damn them...
                                 BOBBY
                   We're ten days late...

      They look at each other.      They are in trouble, and now
      they know it.
                                 BOBBY
                   Cheer up. Have a look around.
                   I'll start on a fire...


129   EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY                                           129
      Hector has scoured the campsite.      He holds up a canteen
      he has found.

                                 HECTOR
                   It's Sandy's... whiskey...
                                 BOBBY
                   Well done, my lad!
      Hector walks to the fire, pleased with     himself. Bobby
      unfolds his fist and looks at what he     has found, an
      Indian arrowhead with a few inches of     broken shaft. He
      folds his hand over it again, keeping     his secret.
      Behind them, nailed to a tree, is a plaque their
      companions have left. It reads, "Pennsylvania Boundary
      Expedition 1761, Marker 152." Also on the plaque someone
      has written, "We left here, 20th October."


130   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                             130
      Hector and Bobby sit by the fire with their supper.      They
      are both anxious, but pretend not to be.

                   Even if we lose their track, we'll
                   still hit the river... we can't
                   miss that.
                                 HECTOR
                   It's too high for Indians?

                                 BOBBY
                   Much too high. You won't find an
                   Indian up here. We just have to
                   keep our heads... no panic.
                                 HECTOR
                   If you did find an Indian, what
                   would he be?

                                 BOBBY
                   You wouldn't... but he might be a
                   Delaware if you did.
                                 HECTOR
                   We keep working?

                                 BOBBY
                   Why not. We can log the peaks on
                   the far side, just a couple of
                   sightings a day... keep us busy...

      Their forced tone of matter-of-factness only serves to
      heighten the growing feeling of doom.
                                 HECTOR
                   You think we'll get out?
                                 BOBBY
                   If we keep our heads.   I wish I
                   had some tobacco.

131   EXT. CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                        131

      Hector is lying awake, watching Bobby's sleeping form on
      the ground at the other side of the dying fire. Behind
      Bobby is a wolf, sniffing and edging his way closer to
      them. Hector isn't anxious. He knows the wolf will soon
      become aware of them and move off. He is worried about
      something else. From under the pack that makes his
      pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow, a shaft and some
      feathers, the other end of Bobby's find. He looks at it,
      then looks back to Bobby and the wolf.

                                                            109.

132   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                        132
      In the morning Hector and Bobby are taking readings from
      the instruments they have hung on a large tree, main-
      taining the disciplines of their work. It gives some
      shape and meaning to their predicament.
                              BOBBY
                Barometer... twenty-eight and
                three-eighths... temperature...                        *
                low... thirty-four... high...
                forty-two and a half... time...

      Hector writes it in the log book. Bobby goes to the              *
      horse and takes a brass chronometer from a box strapped
      to the saddle. Hector takes out a smaller chronometer
      from his own pack. They compare readings. There is a
      difference of some four or five minutes in the time.

                              BOBBY
                It's getting worse... you're
                nearly five minutes fast now...
                              HECTOR
                I'm not fast... you're slowing
                down.
      They obviously have this tiff every morning.
                              HECTOR
                What's the point of having two
                chronometers when you don't take
                the average?
                              BOBBY
                Exactly... you should throw yours
                away.
                              HECTOR
                You're unscientific, Bobby... at
                heart...
      Hector writes in the book.   He speaks pointedly.

                              HECTOR
                Seven twenty-five...

      Bobby mocks him with a laugh.                                    *

      Bobby is leading the horse and Hector walks on ahead.            *
      The going is easy through the ferns and grasses. Bobby           *
      for a moment forgets his apprehensions and starts to sing
      loudly.

                   I see her in the dewy flowers
                   I see her sweet and fair...
      His voice rings sharply around the forest. Hector far
      ahead turns around, taken by surprise. Bobby has
      frightened himself too. He eyes the forest all around
      as the echo of his voice fades. Chastened, he begins
      to sing again, quietly this time, under his breath.
                                 BOBBY
                   There's not a bonny bird that sings
                   But minds me o' my Jean...

134   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                        134

      Hector and Bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock
      looking out across the broad valley.
      They are building a pile of stones, a cairn. They work
      quietly, methodically. The only sounds are of their
      breathing and the CLICK-CLACK of the stones. We feel the
      echoes of our many previous Hectors and their piles of
      stones, built for this or that purpose. Our doomed
      surveyors are acting out the same ritual, this time in
      the name of science.
      They finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over
      it, and dangle a plumb line from the tripod. Bobby
      scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn.
      They are establishing a survey point. They talk as they
      work.

      When they anchor their   tripod, the cold hard sound of
      their CHISELS STRIKING   ROCK ECHOES all through the forest.
      It unnerves them. They    stop hammering and listen to the
      ECHO BOUNCING down the   valley.
                                 HECTOR
                   Sure this is a good idea.

                                 BOBBY
                   Let's get out of here.

      They hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the
      horse, in an atmosphere of controlled panic.

135   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          135

      They are travelling together now, on either side of the
      horse's nose, finding comfort in the closeness of each
      other. They stop for Bobby to consult his compass.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                111.         *

      He indicates a slight change of direction, and they move
      off again. Still they don't talk. We can feel their
      anxiety breeding in the silence. Why don't they talk?
      They proceed in this weighty silence, but even the CRIES
      of the BIRDS now seem to mock them.

      The route takes them downhill. The slopes are more dense
      with undergrowth now and the going isn't so easy. Some-
      times they are reduced to an undignified scramble, hanging
      onto the bulk of the horse between them. They no longer
      look much like conquerors of the wilderness.

136   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                            136

      They are on the valley floor now. The trees are more
      openly spaced and the grass is richer. They are moving
      quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on
      the trot. It hasn't seen grass this good in weeks.

137   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                            137

      They are moving more slowly, the ground is rockier and
      the trees are thickening. They take the easy way up the
      hillside, a natural path made by deer or bear.
      It is difficult to know who is more shaken by their
      encounter, the Indian or Hector and Bobby.
      The INDIAN is sitting behind a tree as they pass, dozing
      or deep in reverie. They almost pass without noticing
      him, but Hector gives a turn of his head and there is the
      Indian four feet from him. At the same instant the Indian
      comes to his senses and sits bolt upright. The encounter
      is high comedy but full of terror for all of them.

      The Indian stands up.       Hector absurdly greets him.
                                   HECTOR
                   Hi!   Hello!
      The Indian backs off from them, holding his hands up and
      smiling crazily, as if to say, "Don't mind me, boys, I'm
      just leaving..." Hector and Bobby are equally silly in
      their response.
                                 HECTOR
                   Hey, come back... we're just
                   moving through... don't
                   apologize... we all got a fright...
                   goodbye...

      The Indian is in full retreat now, waving his hands about
      apologetically, but making good distance from them.
      Suddenly, he is gone. It has happened so quickly that
      Hector and Bobby scarcely believe it has happened. Then
      they realize that in their fright they have let go of the
      horse. It has headed back down to the tastier pastures
      in the valley. They see it disappearing into the trees
      below them.
                                 BOBBY
                   That was stupid...

                                 HECTOR
                   Did you see him?

                                 BOBBY
                   Sure I saw him.
                                 HECTOR
                   Was he a Delaware?
                                 BOBBY
                   How the fuck should I know? He
                   was an Indian... and Indians don't
                   come in ones...
                                 HECTOR
                   Yeah... I think he was an Indian
                   too... What about the horse?
                                 BOBBY
                   I'm not going back down there.
                                 HECTOR
                   Don't panic, Bobby...
                                BOBBY
                   Why not?
      He runs off into the forest.        Then he turns and shouts to
      Hector.

                                BOBBY
                   Come on!

      Hector follows him, a mad race through the forest.

138   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                             138

      Hector and Bobby are sitting on a rock, gathering their
      wits. It is odd how they talk so matter-of-factly.
                                 HECTOR
                   What did you see?

                   Same as you.

                                 HECTOR
                   An Indian... with long hair...

                                 BOBBY
                   That's it... kind of short...
                                 HECTOR
                   Yeah... he was't tall...

                                 BOBBY
                   That's the one.

      Hector scans the hills above them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Let's get a bit further up.
      They move off.     Bobby looks at Hector's backpack.
                                 BOBBY
                   What've you got in there?
                                 HECTOR
                   Some food, the logbooks, my
                   letters, a candle...

                                  BOBBY
                   A gun?
                                  HECTOR
                   No.


139   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                        139

      They have stopped to make camp. It is late afternoon,
      the sky just darkening, sharp shadows on the far peaks, a
      purple glow in the air.

                                 BOBBY
                   We won't have a fire tonight. We
                   should make a shelter though, in
                   case it snows.

                                 HECTOR
                   What about bears, without a fire?

      Bobby laughs quietly.

                                 BOBBY
                   Don't even think about bears, Hector.

                                                            114.       *

      They are making a round frame of bent branches and cover-
      ing it with foliage. Half-hidden in the undergrowth, it
      is big enough for two men to huddle in. Tonight they feel
      the most basic of urges, to curl up in a ball and hide.

141   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                          141

      They are safe and snug in their hideaway. Hector has lit
      his candle. He is reading his letters, holding them close
      to his eyes in the dimness. He has the air of someone
      putting his affairs in order. Bobby is thinking aloud.
                              BOBBY
                Maybe he's lost too... on his
                own... must be Delaware... they
                were chased up here years ago...
                everybody thought they'd cleared
                off west... the other side of
                Ohio... they were an angry lot...
                no wonder... they used to farm on
                the coast.
      He looks up at Hector, and allows himself a small smile.
                              BOBBY
                Go on, read it out...
      Hector looks up.
                                 HECTOR
                What?     No... not tonight...
                              BOBBY
                I've had to listen to it every
                night since April... why not now?

      Hector gives in. He holds a scrap of paper close to the
      candle and reads.
                              HECTOR
                Dear, Father, I miss you. Three
                frogs are dead. Everybody misses
                you.  Bring me a bear's head and
                claws and a gun. School is good.
                Miss White has married a fireman.
                Come back soon. Do not worry
                about the frogs, they did not
                have names. Nathaniel.

      Hector looks up at Bobby.

                              HECTOR
                It's not so funny now as it was.

                   It wasn't funny then.

                                 HECTOR
                   If you knew him... if you could
                   picture him saying it... it would
                   be funnier.

                                 BOBBY
                   I had a father like you... nine
                   months on a whaler and then three
                   weeks at home telling us all how
                   much he missed us...
                                 HECTOR
                   I'm going home, for the winter...

      Bobby doesn't pursue his argument.    He tenses, then
      sniffs the air vigorously.
                                BOBBY
                   Smell it?
                                HECTOR
                   No.
                                 BOBBY
                   Goddam it... smell it?

      Hector sniffs some more.
                                HECTOR
                   Tobacco?

      They whisper.
                                 BOBBY
                   Where the hell is it coming
                   from?
      He puts his head out of the shelter.

                                 BOBBY
                   I can't tell... a night like this
                   it could carry for miles...

      He huddles back inside the shelter.
                                 BOBBY
                   I wish I had a smoke.

      After a tense silence, Hector takes a small package from
      an inside pocket. He hands it to Bobby.

                                 HECTOR
                   I was saving it... you have it...

      It is a wedge of tobacco.      Bobby takes it.

                                 BOBBY
                   What do you mean, you were saving
                   it? You know the rules... no
                   hoarding, tobacco or food... you've
                   listened to me for a month, day and
                   night... wanting a smoke...

                                 HECTOR
                   Well have it now... I don't smoke...
                   take it...
                                 BOBBY
                   You've kept it from me, and you
                   don't even use it...
                                 HECTOR
                   I was saving it for my birthday...
                   I was going to give it to you then...
                                 BOBBY
                   I have to wait until your birthday
                   for a smoke? Who are you... the
                   fucking king?
                                 HECTOR
                   Go on, smoke it... have it now...

                   I bloody won't... I'm not smoking
                   on your command... I bloody won't.
      There is a brooding silence.

                                   BOBBY
                   God,   your poor children... what do
                   they   have to do for a piece of
                   candy   in your house? It's very

      Hector is neatly turning the tables on Bobby, who now
      appears churlish, childish.

                                 BOBBY
                   No... I'll have it in the morning.

                                 HECTOR
                   Come on... tell me... who would
                   you rather be sitting here with...
                   have a think...

      Bobby does, and then breaks into a smile.
                                   BOBBY
                   Daniel Boone?

      Hector smiles, too.
                                 HECTOR
                   Yeah. He would be a help... but
                   after Daniel Boone...
                                 BOBBY
                   I can't think of anyone else... but
                   you're impossible to like sometimes.
      Suddenly Bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy.
                                 BOBBY
                   We should sleep. We've got a lot
                   of running to do in the morning.
      But Hector has other plans.          He is in control of their
      friendship now.
                                 HECTOR
                   No we're not... we're going to
                   talk... all night...
      Bobby yields to this with the softest, most vulnerable
      smile we have yet seen on his face.

                                 HECTOR
                   So... where do you want to start?

      Bobby is silent, but still smiles his acquiescent smile.
      Hector reads the silence well.
                                 HECTOR
                   I know where you want to start...

      Bobby is still silent.

                   I'm the one that has to apologize...

      Bobby is mischievous now.

                   Oh no you're not...
      It will be a worthwhile night for both of them.


142   EXT. FOREST - DAWN                                          142
      It is a glorious dawn. Bobby sits looking out on the
      valley, smoking his pipe. Behind him Hector is busy
      writing in his log book.

                                 BOBBY
                   Isn't it a beautiful day?
      Hector finishes his writing, tears out the page from his
      book. He offers it to Bobby.
                                 HECTOR
                   I've said who we are and where
                   we're headed. Want to sign it,
                   write anything?
                                  BOBBY
                   No.
                                 HECTOR
                   The peak we logged yesterday...
                   I've named it Nathanial Mountain.
                   After my boy... is that fine with
                   you?
                                 BOBBY
                   I was going to call it Tobacco
                   Mountain... or Mount Alicia... but
                   Nathaniel's fine...
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           119.         *

      Hector smiles. He puts the paper in a small leather
      pouch, puts the pouch on the ground near the shelter,
      and starts to build a small pile of protective stones
      on top of it.
      Bobby stands, and turns to watch him.

                                 BOBBY
                   Let's get away from here.
                                   HECTOR
                   North?
                                   BOBBY
                   Yeah.    Keep the sun on our backs.

      Bobby walks off with great clouds of tobacco smoke
      billowing defiantly around him, as if to challenge
      their night-time tormentor.
      Hector takes a last look at their shelter and its little
      memorial cairn and then runs to catch up with Bobby.


143   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          143
      Hector and Bobby look vulnerable as they walk through
      the open forest with their meager packs on their backs.

                                 BOBBY
                   We can move quicker without the
                   horse... we just have to keep
                   moving... we have to get away from
                   here.
      Behind them they don't see the figure moving from the
      cover of one tree to another, and then another figure
      following the first. They move like ghosts.

144   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          144

      Bobby is a few steps ahead of Hector. He dips down
      over a rise, and instantly returns. He throws himself
      and Hector to the ground. Hector tries to struggle free.

                                   HECTOR
                   What's wrong?
                                  BOBBY
                   Quiet.   They're on the other side...

      Hector ducks lower, hugging the ground. Bobby is
      already sliding up the slope to look over the rise.
      Hector follows him.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             120.

144   CONTINUED:                                                    144
      On the other side, they see the women and children of
      a small group of Indians at the edge of a stream. The
      women are washing clothes, the children are splashing and
      playing. We are close enough to hear their laughter.
                                 BOBBY
                   We're right in the middle of them...

                                 HECTOR
                   Does it have to be bad?   They might
                   be friendly...

                                 BOBBY
                   They were chased here... They should
                   be on the coast growing corn...

      Bobby turns to Hector to make his point. That is when he
      sees the first of the figures, just the ghost of a shadow
      moving from tree to rock. His eyes flick across the
      forest behind them. He sees another figure caught in
      the act of seeking cover, looking absurdly embarrassed
      for the fleeting moment that we see it. Then Bobby
      sees another. Are they teasing them? It looks so much
      like a game children would play.
                                   BOBBY
                   Oh-oh...                                               *
                                   HECTOR
                   What's wrong?                                          *
                                 BOBBY
                   They're behind us. They must
                   think we're stalking the women...
      Hector looks and sees nothing. Fifty Indians hold their
      breath. The forest seems empty. But Hector looks at
      Bobby. He is grey-faced, a man who is looking at death.
      Hector knows they are doomed.
                                 BOBBY
                   Do you want to run?
                                 HECTOR
                   I'll do what you do.
                                                                          *
      They leap to their feet and run. There is only one
      way to go, over the rise, through the women and children
      and across the stream. To the watching Indians it looks
      like a direct attack on their families. From behind
      trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase. A
      tragedy of misunderstanding.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                 121.

144   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             144
      Hector and Bobby scatter the women and children and
      splash across the stream, burning all their energy in               *
      this mad life-or-death race. Although their families
      are safe, the Indians keep up the chase, the moment of
      confusion compounded in action. They lope easily after
      them, waiting for the white men to tire. There are no               *
      whoops or shouts. They follow Hector and Bobby into the
      trees, spreading out on either side, shaping the human
      net that will soon engulf them.
      It is a menacing spectacle. Death is near.        Hector
      and Bobby stay close together as they run.
                                 BOBBY
                   When they catch up... fight...
                   it'll be quicker... fight like
                   hell...
                                 HECTOR
                   They're not going to catch us.
                   We're going home.
      Hector stretches out an arm to Bobby.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hold my hand, Bobby...
      They hold hands and run.


145   EXT. BUILDING - DAY                                           145
      A war party of media people surround Hector as he exits
      a Yellow Cab. He forces his way through the yelling
      crowd of REPORTERS and camera crews. Hector is trying
      to make his way into a crumbling apartment building in
      Queens. Policemen help Hector through the barrage of                *
      shouted questions.
                                 REPORTER #1
                   Do you know the lady, Mr. Troup?

      Hector enters the building. The media mob immediately
      switch off their energy. They light cigarettes, fiddle              *
      with cameras, stare into space, as if someone has
      shouted "Cut."

146   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                         146

      Hector climbs to the fourth floor.     A POLICEMAN goes with
      him.

      Two paramedics come up the stairs behind them, carrying a
      stretcher. The Policeman stops.
                                 POLICEMAN
                   You guys are downstairs... third
                   floor... thirty-eight...
      The paramedics turn around and head back down the stairs.
      Hector looks at the Policeman curiously.
                                 POLICEMAN
                   You're forty-eight.

      They continue climbing.

147   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                        147

      Hector and the Policeman squeeze past a cluster of people
      at the door and enter the apartment.
                                 POLICEMAN
                   This is Troup!
      A DETECTIVE is with another man who looks like a city
      official.

                                 DETECTIVE
                   Come here, Troup. I'm Cobb.

      Hector joins them.
                                 DETECTIVE
                   You bring everything?

                                HECTOR
                   What?
                                 DETECTIVE
                   Building warrant, license, fire
                   certificate, sanitation
                   certificate... I want them all...
                   This is Mr. Santiago, from the
                   city... insurance...

                   or so anyway...

                                 DETECTIVE
                   Slow down, Troup... so it's 3:15
                   on a Friday... you're staying here
                   'til Mr. Santiago gets the

                   here, with everything... this is
                   serious...

      Hector looks at his watch.

                                   HECTOR
                   3:35...
                                 MR. SANTIAGO
                   I might have to close the place
                   down.

                                   HECTOR
                   Where is she?
      The Detective and Hector walk down the hall. They stop
      at the door of the bathroom. Hector looks inside. There
      is a large ragged hole in the floor. At the far side of
      it the toilet unit dangles at a dangerous angle into the
      hole, held only by its plumbing. Firemen are working to
      secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props
      and hydraulic jacks. Lying on the floor below,
      surrounded by rubble, and being attended by the
      paramedics, is an old lady, MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS. She
      tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over
      the rim of the hole. She looks angry.
                                 MR. PHILIPPOPOLIS
                   I phoned you Monday... I told you
                   the floor was making noises...
                                 HECTOR
                   Not me, Mrs. Philippopolis... my
                   ex-partner... I think you spoke                          *
                   to him... How are you feeling?
      Hector says this clearly, for the benefit of the
      Detective and Mr. Santiago. The Detecitve is unimpressed.

                                 DETECTIVE
                   Come back from there, Troup, the

                   They waited for a portable X-Ray
                   machine... they can move her now.
                                 HECTOR
                   She seems in good spirits...

      As if in response, Mrs. Philippopolis shouts up to
      Hector as she sees him leaving the bathroom above her.

                                 MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS
                   Wait 'til my son sees his mother

                   you should be ashamed... to let old
                   people live like this... I phoned
                   you Monday... I have a witness!
                   I was dancing with a prince on my
                   eighteenth birthday, and now look at
                   me... you have me falling down a
                   toilet!


148   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                         148
      Hector retreats into the hallway. Takes out his mobile
      phone and dials, while watching the ominous Mr. Santiago
      making copius notes in his book. Hector gets connected.

                                 HECTOR
                   Boris... why did you do this to
                   me? Get down here now... they
                   want all kinds of certificates...
                   They won't let me leave the
                   building... I have my kids tonight,
                   I haven't seen them in four years...
                   I did tell you, I've been talking
                   about it all week... how come they
                   phoned me, this isn't my building?
                   What? Don't tell me anymore... I
                   want you here, now... and on your
                   knee... I'll phone the lawyer...
                   but you move. My weekend's ruined
                   before it's started.

      Hector quickly dials another number.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                 HECTOR
                   Anna... thank God... you have to
                   help me... I'm still in Queens...                      *
                   I've got cops here and everything                      *
                   ... I need your car... I don't have
                   time to pick up the rental now...
                   they won't let me leave the
                   building... you come down here...
                   and put my bag in the car... no..                      *
                   I have to pick the kids up by six,
                   otherwise I fuck up her weekend
                   too... she'll kill me... this is
                   an emergency... what can I say?
                   Please... right... okay...

      He finishes the call just as Santiago approaches, waving
      his notebook now full of incriminating notes.
                                 SANTIAGO
                   It looks like water rotted the
                   floor... You have any plumbing
                   maintenance records?
                                 HECTOR
                   At the office... I might have some
                   bills... it's not my building.                         *
      Santiago is talking almost to himself now, absorbed in the
      mundane mechanics of Hector's building.
                                 SANTIAGO
                   It's a weird one... I don't know
                   how water could sit in there for
                   so long without somebody noticing
                   ... you didn't use water-resistent
                   paint on the ceilings did you?

      Hector shakes his head wearily.
                                 HECTOR
                   I don't really know...

                                 SANTIAGO
                   You're going to have to check out                      *
                   the whole building... you know
                   that, don't you?

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I do it Monday?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Good joke... it'll take you a
                   month.

      Hector is already dialing another number as Santiago
      wanders off in search of further fascinating discoveries.

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I speak with Leonard, please...
                   Mr. Deutsch? My name is Hector
                   Troup, Borlonski and Troup, Real
                   Estate...
      There is a moment's pause.

                                 HECTOR
                   Leonard... it's Hector... Borlonski
                   and Troup... yes... listen, we've
                   had a domestic accident at our
                   Eighth Street building... a floor                     *
                   ... and an old lady... she did
                   mention the word sue, but it might
                   have been hysterics... what I need
                   to know is what certificates you
                   have on file for the building... I                    *
                   know it's Friday... just do one                       *
                   thing... let me know if the
                   insurance is current... I need to
                   know that... I'm on my mobile...
                   anything you have... before five
                   ... thank you...
      During the call Hector has walked   down the hall and back
      to the hole in the floor. He sees    Mrs. Philippopolis,
      now strapped in a stretcher, being   carried out of the
      room below. At the sight of him,    she tries to sit up,
      straining on her straps.

                                 MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS
                   My son's downstairs... when he
                   sees me like this he'll kill you...
                   go on... jump through the hole...
                   see what it feels like! Break both
                   legs!

      Hector is almost tempted to do what she says.

      Hector is following the paramedics as they negotiate
      Mrs. Philippopolis down the three flights of stairs.
      He is on the phone again. This time to his former wife.

                   I'll be on the way in thirty
                   minutes at the outside... I can't

                   I get the car... I'll be there...
      All the while Mrs. Philippopolis issues a non-stop                    *
      torrent of Greek expletives -- calmly and in a considered             *
      tone, but obviously obscene. Hector is shocked.                       *


150   EXT. BUILDING - DAY                                           150
      On a street Hector stands with a Policeman watching                   *
      Mrs. Philippopolis being loaded into the ambulance. Her
      SON is with her. When she is safely inside he walks
      towards Hector. Fortunately he is of modest build, and
      a head shorter than Hector, and he seems to be saving
      his wrath for the Courthouse.
                                 SON
                   Mr. Troup, I'm George
                   Philippopolis.
      They shake hands.
                                 HECTOR
                   I'm sorry about your mother...
                                 SON
                   Well... it's happened... you want
                   to travel with us, or do you have
                   a car?

                                HECTOR
                   What?

                   To the hospital...

                   Well, I wasn't planning to...

                   her family with her now... Any
                   other Friday but this one.

      The Son addresses the Policeman.

                                 SON
                   He's not coming to the hospital...

      The Policeman looks at Hector.
                                 POLICEMAN
                   That could look bad...

      The cop is enjoying his role as straight man to these
      two. Hector takes out his diary.
                                 HECTOR
                   Look, George... here's what I can
                   do... I'll visit her on Tuesday,
                   I'll organize some flowers...
                   lots...                                                  *

                   check her into the hospital...
                   who's gonna pay? It's your
                   building that fell down...
                                                                            *
      He nods his head to the Policeman.
                                 HECTOR
                   They won't let me leave here...
      The Policeman this time backs him up.

                                  POLICEMAN
                   That's true.

      The Son backs off to the waiting ambulance reluctantly.
                                 SON
                   Wait 'til they hear this in court                        *

                   to the hospital... Can't you even                        *
                   give me a credit card number?                            *

                   Deutsch is checking the

                   a thing... it might   help if you
                   make a visit to the   hospital...
                   why did you do this   to me?

                   I'm sorry, Hector... I   just put
                   your name on the lousy   forms... I
                   didn't plan this... I   just
                   borrowed your name on   the titles.
      Hector doesn't let up on his anger.

                                 HECTOR
                   I told you to stop doing that...
                   why does this keep happening to
                   me... my name is mine... use your
                   own name, Boris Borlonski... will
                   you remember that?
                   Boris Borlonski!

      Boris is conciliatory.
                                 BORIS
                   Hector... forgive me... I'll take
                   care of it... don't let it spoil
                   your weekend... four years, huh?
                   You make the most of it... and
                   don't worry, you'll walk away

      Hector is calm now. We can sense real depth in their
      relationship, despite Boris's pranks.

      Then Hector's girl friend ANNA arrives in her car. It is
      a bright pink station wagon, highly decorated with flower
      motifs and slogans like "ANNA'S ARRANGEMENTS," and "FRESH
      OR DRY, WE'LL PLEASE THE EYE." Anna is a florist.
      Hector brightens when he sees her. Everything is falling
      into place. All he has to do now is cross two rivers
      and Manhatan Island in under an hour, in Anna's pink car.
      He runs to meet her.

                   Yeah. Your camera's in there too.
                   Take some photographs of the

                                  HECTOR
                   Sure.   Thanks.
                                 ANNA
                   Nervous?

                                 HECTOR
                   Not much... just like I'm being
                   executed...
                                 ANNA
                   Well you deserve to suffer.

      Our Hectors have been hearing this for centuries, but at
      least Anna smiles when she says it.
                                 ANNA
                   Don't worry... this is the
                   beginning of something... not the
                   end... you can start being a
                   father again.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'm glad you talked me into it.
                                 ANNA
                   I didn't do much... you were
                   ready...
                                 HECTOR
                   You're right... you're absolutely
                   right... I was ready... I am
                   ready, for everything... I'm
                   fixing all that shit with Boris...
                   I told him... it can't go on...
                   I want my freedom.
      Anna is looking at him amusedly, nodding her head with
      every earnest pronouncement that he makes.

                                 HECTOR
                   ... and the kids... that'll work
                   out... we can have them over
                   sometimes... Yeah?
                                 ANNA
                   Sure... that was the plan... when
                   we have the space...
                                 HECTOR
                   Right, when we have the space...
                   when we get the bigger apartment...
                   together...
                                 ANNA
                   There you go... you said it...
                   the bigger apartment together...

      Hector is pleased with himself.

                   Yeah... I said it, didn't I?

                                 ANNA
                   You're a man of decision,
                   Hector...

      Hector is high on his optimism now, and cheeky with it.
                                 HECTOR
                   Yes I am... Together... I said it
                   ... and get out of my car at the
                   corner here... I don't have the
                   time to go 'round the block.

      Anna pulls into the curb. Hector leans over to embrace
      her before she has stopped the car.
                                 HECTOR
                   Thanks... for the car...
                   everything...
                                 ANNA
                   Do the best you can with them,
                   Hector... and one more thing...
                   deliver these...
      She indicates a massive bouquet of flowers wrapped in
      cellophane, taking up the whole of the luggage space in
      the car.
                                  HECTOR
                   What?   Anna, I can't...

                                 ANNA
                   Here's the address... just two
                   blocks before the bridge... a
                   five minute detour. It's a
                   golden wedding... you have to...
      She looks him straight in the eye.

                                 ANNA
                   We have to help each other...

      Hector accepts this.

                                 ANNA
                   Oh, you'll need gas too... Go to
                   it, Hector...

      She kisses him quickly, but lovingly.

      Hector watches Anna stride, in her business-like way,
      around the corner OUT OF SIGHT. He is almost home.


153   INT./EXT. CAR - DAY                                         153
      A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on
      a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence
      whatever you do with it, and that's fine.
      Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us
      than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of
      our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did
      or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the
      threads together.
      And after so many images of the natural world, a world
      little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in
      all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen-
      sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film,
      when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit,
      then it will be somewhere around here that it happens.
      Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching
      for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New
      Jersey Hector will complete his journey.
      We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the
      avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE
      RINGS ONCE.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hello... Leonard, hello... yes...
                   we're insured... thank God... yes
                   now I know God's a lawyer...
                   thanks...
      On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban
      street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds
      on green then he might even make it on time.
      Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out
      a sigh of relief.

154   EXT. HOUSE - EVENING                                        154

      Hector's former wife, JANET, and her new husband, DONALD,
      come out of the house as Hector walks up to the door.
      Donald is carrying luggage and heads straight for their
      car in the driveway.

                                 DONALD
                   Hi, Hector.

      He starts loading up the car.       Janet talks to Hector.
                                 JANET
                   You made it. The kids are just
                   coming. They're not over the
                   moon about going to the beach
                   house. I ought to warn you.

                                 HECTOR
                   Why didn't you say? I could have
                   fixed up something else. I
                   thought it would be a good place
                   to get to know them again...

                                 JANET
                   Well, I figured you should be                            *
                   allowed to make your own mistakes.
                   It's only for a couple of nights,
                   they can take it... and you'll
                   learn... Check into a hotel if
                   it gets too much... they like
                   hotels.
      She shouts into the house.
                                 JANET
                   Come on, you two... your father's
                   ready to go...
      She hands Hector a piece of paper.

                                 JANET
                   This is where we'll be, if
                   anything crops up... thanks for
                   the break...
      Hector gets a little scared about what he has taken on.

                                 HECTOR
                   Maybe this is a bit sudden for
                   them... Maybe I should have come
                   over a couple of nights and got
                   to know them...

      Janet doesn't let him off the hook.
                                 JANET
                   By Monday, you'll know them...

      Then the children come out of the house, BETSY, who is
      about thirteen, and TOM, who is eleven.

                   Here he is, the invisible dad.

      She turns to Hector.
                                 JANET
                   That's what they call you.

      Hector is daunted by how grown up they are, not any
      more the little kids in the photograph in his wallet.

                                HECTOR
                   Hi.
      They hardly lift their heads to him.

                                BETSY
                   Hi.
                                TOM
                   Hi.
      Janet takes control of the farewells.

                                 JANET
                   You three have a good weekend.
                   If it's too miserable at the
                   house your father said he'll
                   take you to a hotel.
      Hector nods his head obediently. He always did with
      Janet. The children let their mother pat them and follow
      Hector to his car, eyes to the ground.

                                 JANET
                   Good luck, Hector.

      Donald shouts from behind the wheel of his car, where he
      has been hiding.
                                 DONALD
                   See you Monday, Hector.
      The kids load themselves into the back of Hector's car.

      Betsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers, wrapped
      in cellophane and red ribbon. It seems to have grown
      even larger than before.
                                 BETSY
                   Are those for mom?

      Hector looks at the flowers.       His face contorts in guilt
      and anxiety.

      They are driving on the freeway. It is dusk. Hector is
      on the telephone again. He can't let go of business.
                                 HECTOR
                   Excuse me, kids... I have to

                   ... oh, she's got a lawyer
                   already? That's a bad omen...
      Betsy and Tom are listening in the back seat, eager for
      clues about this virtual stranger in front of them.
                                 HECTOR
                   Is there anything we can do right
                   now... make her an offer... Sure,

      Hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat, lets out
      a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the mirror.
      Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than
      they are, and vulnerable. Hector's heart aches for them.
      He smiles and puts on an act of brightness.

                                 HECTOR
                   That's it! The last call... the

                   gas... soon...
      They return his look with blank expressions.        He picks up
      the phone and offers it to them.

      She shakes her head.
                                   HECTOR
                   Tom?
                                 TOM
                   No... and it's Thomas...
                                 HECTOR
                   But we called you Tom... that's
                   what it says on your birth
                   certificate...
                                   THOMAS (TOM)
                   I changed it.
      Hector wisely lets it go.

                                 HECTOR
                   Right... it's your name... you                            *
                   can do that... Safeway... keep your                       *

156   INT. SAFEWAY - NIGHT                                           156

      Hector is pushing a cart around a large Safeway. The
      place is almost deserted. Betsy and Thomas are tagging
      along.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               138.

      For every four items Hector puts in his cart Betsy
      removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector
      notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy
      returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he
      makes a stand. He turns to face her.

                                 HECTOR
                   What's wrong with that? It's a
                   kitchen roll... why can't I pick
                   a kitchen roll?

      Betsy is defiant.
                                 BETSY
                   It's bleached... and it isn't
                   recycled... you don't care...
                   you just buy junk...
      She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from
      the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the
      sense to back down.
                                 HECTOR
                   Good point, Betsy...
      Betsy keeps on the attack.
                                 BETSY
                   Everything you buy is junk... I
                   don't eat steak... and what's
                   this...
      She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers.

                                 BETSY
                   Ugh! Why don't you ask us what
                   we like... it'll save you money...
                   you buy junk, we won't eat it...
      A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice.
      Hector warms to her.

                                   HECTOR
                   You're right.

      Hector pushes the cart to her.

                                 HECTOR
                   Well, get to it... I'll just tag
                   along...

      Betsy moves off with the cart.
                                 BETSY
                   I do it every week anyway.

      Thomas backs her up.

                                THOMAS
                   She does. She tells us what to
                   eat. We let her.

      Hector follows them up the aisle.

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I just keep a couple of those
                   steaks? We can't live on chicken.                   *

157   EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT                                   157

      Hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to
      the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in
      the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some
      reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few
      brief moments they are talking without words as their
      tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of
      the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the
      twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are
      back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the
      back of the car the kids have watched it all.
      Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he
      climbs back into the car.


158   INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                      158
      Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen
      asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep,
      searching for some traces of the little children that
      have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots
      he abandoned.

159   EXT. HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT                                 159

      The car pulls up at the holiday house. Hector gets out.
      It is dark, but we can hear the sound of the SEA and
      there is sand underfoot. Hector walks to the house and
      unlocks the door. He puts on a couple of exterior lights.
      He carries Thomas, still sleeping, from the car and into
      the house. Betsy follows him, still half-asleep, groaning
      fussily. She talks through her yawns.
                                 BETSY
                   Are you going to bring the flowers
                   in?
                                 HECTOR
                   Don't mention the flowers.

                                                            140.       *

160   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         160
      Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a
      day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW.
      A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking
      to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones
      which he regularly scatters on the floor.

                              TV MAN (V.O.)
                This is good, Tony, the stones
                are talking to me already... now
                here's something... travel...
                movement... Tony, are you planning
                a move... travel... anything?
                              TONY (V.O.)
                Yes I am... I've been thinking
                about a move to California...

                              TV MAN (V.O.)
                The big one, eh, Tony? These
                stones are really talking here...
                what are you planning for yourself
                in California?
                              TONY (V.O.)
                I'm hoping for an acting career,
                Mel...
                              TV MAN (V.O.)
                Tony, these stones really like
                what you're planning... there is
                no doubt in my mind about that...
                now listen... you have to be
                specific... these stones really
                want to tell you something, be it
                love, money or the purpose of your
                life... but I want a specific
                question from you... think about
                it... what do you want to know...
                love... or your income level next
                year? Be as specific as you
                can, Tony...

      Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier
      Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He
      stands up and leaves the room.


161   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         161
      Next door, he watches the kids sleeping in their little
      holiday beds. Hector watches them. We've seen our
      Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as
      he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               141.         *

      Betsy starts talking loudly. At first Hector thinks she
      is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep.

                                 BETSY
                   Get me the books... all the books...
                   all of the books... no, no, no...
                   not the pancakes... not the
                   pancakes... no...
      She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a
      tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully.

                                 BETSY
                   ... not the pancakes...

      Hector is a confusion of feelings: frightened,
      fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he
      possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort
      could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is
      a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than
      the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door.
                                 TV WOMAN (V.O.)
                   ... find your true cosmic partner
                   first time around... every weekday
                   morning at three here on the Psychic
                   Network... Lucinda's Horoscope Dating
                   Show... remember there is an answer,
                   and there is a special partner out
                   there for you...
      Hector moves quietly out of the room, Betsy's sobs having
      subsided. Just as he is closing the door he gets
      another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas.
                                 THOMAS
                   ... don't let the oil run out...
                   yes you did... watch the oil...
                   why... why?
      Hector closes the bedroom door.     He is one spooked, moved
      human being.

162   INT. HOUSE - MORNING                                          162

      In the morning, they are making breakfast in the kitchen.
      The kids are having juice and cereal. Hector is
      scrambling some eggs.

                                 HECTOR
                   How about some eggs?
      They shake their heads.

                                 HECTOR
                   You don't eat eggs?

                                 BETSY
                   How many have you got in there?

                                  HECTOR
                   Three.   Is that all right?
                                 BETSY
                   For a week, maybe.

      Hector does a little probing.
                                 HECTOR
                   How about pancakes, Betsy... d'you
                   like pancakes?
                                 BETSY
                   Not much... why?
                                 HECTOR
                   I just wondered. Pancakes don't
                   mean much to you?
                                 BETSY
                   They don't mean a thing.     Why?
                                 HECTOR
                   Nothing.
      The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in
      infinity. Hector changes the subject.

                                 HECTOR
                   I thought we could walk into town
                   this morning. I saw the Funfair
                   when we came through last night.
                                 THOMAS
                   We don't go to Funfairs.

                                 HECTOR
                   Let's take the walk anyway.

                                 THOMAS
                   I brought some books.   I want to
                   stay home and read.
      Hector is determined to make it work.

                                  HECTOR
                   No.   We're taking a walk.

                                                            143.

163   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                         163
      They are preparing to leave the house.   Thomas is still
      reluctant to go.

                              THOMAS
                It's going to rain... we should
                stay.

                              HECTOR
                Here's an umbrella... and there
                must be some old coats in here...
                and shoes... I only have these
                I'm wearing...
                              THOMAS
                Donald has some shoes...

      Thomas is already in the cupboard under the stairs.   He
      emerges with a pair of sturdy walking shoes.
                              HECTOR
                I don't know if I want to wear
                Donald's shoes.
                              THOMAS
                Why not?
      Hector declines to explain the complex   reasons that he
      might have for not wanting to wear the   shoes of his
      children's replacement father. He sits    down on the            *
      stairs to put them on. Then something    on the wall
      catches his eye.
                               HECTOR
                Wow.   Look at this.
      The kids' heights have been marked on the wall on some
      long-ago holiday. The dates are beside them.

                              HECTOR
                Six years ago. Look at that...
                What's this?

      He points to a mark and a date lower down on the wall.
                              THOMAS
                That was the flood. The sea came
                right up. Donald says it's the
                icecap melting. It's going to get
                worse. That's why Mom's selling
                the place.

164   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               164
      They are on the beach, walking in the direction of town.
      Hector strides ahead in a show of enthusiasm, although
      awkward in Donald's big shoes. The kids trail behind.
      He calls back to them.
                                 HECTOR
                   Where are the birds?    Is it the
                   wrong time of year?
                                 BETSY
                   They don't come over so much.
                   The shellfish have gone... that's
                   what...
                                 HECTOR
                   That's what Donald says?
                                 BETSY
                   Yes... and it happens to be true.

      Hector looks at the sky.       He speaks quietly to himself.
                                 HECTOR
                   Please don't rain... please...


165   EXT. FUNFAIR - DAY                                             165

      The light DRIZZLE now falling is keeping away what few                *
      fun-seekers there are left in town. The Funfair is not
      much fun. It is the end of the season. Hector and the                 *
      kids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys. The
      kids seem to glory in the misery of it all, getting back
      at Hector for four years of neglect. Heavy-hearted,
      Hector still tries to make a go of it.

                                 HECTOR
                   Let's have a ride...
      He has stopped at some dated space rockets.

                                 BETSY
                   The seats are wet.
      Hector triumphs. He pulls a wad of kitchen roll from
      his pocket and starts to wipe the seats.

                                 HECTOR
                   Kitchen roll, unbleached,
                   re-cycled, biodegradable... dry
                   seats...
      Betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb
      aboard the rockets.

      As the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up
      into the drizzle, 'round and 'round, Hector knows that he
      has to do something to break the awful distance between
      him and his kids. He looks at them. They sit grimly in
      their rockets, one in front of him and one behind. Their
      faces are set in expressions of what? Boredom?
      Resignation? Patience? Expectancy? Then he realizes
      what is going on. They are waiting for him to open up to
      them, talk to them seriously, explain himself. He looks
      at Betsy's face and sees in it the years of his absence,
      her stoicism, her patience, her courage. It moves him.
      He leans over to her.
                                 HECTOR
                   This is ridiculous. Let's go
                   somewhere and talk.
      Betsy smiles her small patient smile.
                                 BETSY
                   All right, if you want to...
      Hector looks to Thomas. Thomas vigorously nods his
      agreement. Hector is happier. He looks down on the
      decrepit fairground.

                                 HECTOR
                   How do we land these things?


166   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                       166
      The only place the small town has to offer is a deserted
      coffee shop on the shorefront. Hector, Betsy and Thomas
      sit at a corner table, beyond them through the window is
      the beach and the ocean.

                                 HECTOR
                   Sure you won't have a pancake,                          *
                   Betsy?                                                  *
      Betsy gets impatient.                                                *

                                BETSY                                      *
                   No!                                                     *

                   Okay, first question?                                     *

      The kids are ready for this.        There is no coyness now.
                                 THOMAS
                   Where have you been?

                                 BETSY
                   What he means is why did you stay
                   away?

      Hector begins like a story-teller embarking on a long
      saga.

                                 HECTOR
                   Well, that's a fair question...
                   your mother and I got divorced...
                   you're big enough to remember...
                   she must have told you all that?
                                 BETSY
                   Sure she has... but lots of people
                   get divorced... that doesn't mean
                   they disappear...
                                 HECTOR
                   You're right... what can I tell
                   you... I went kind of crazy after
                   that, for a good while... I came
                   around a few times... remember?
                                 THOMAS
                   Not really.
                                 HECTOR
                   Well, it wasn't easy... everything
                   with her and Donald happened
                   pretty quickly. I missed you both
                   really badly... but for a while I
                   thought I should stay away, until
                   your mother got settled... no,
                   that's not really true... I missed
                   you... but I was kind of crazy at
                   the same time... your mother and I
                   married young... I wasn't used to
                   the freedom... it went to my head
                   ... then you moved to New Jersey.

                   It's forty minutes away on a slow
                   bus...
                                 HECTOR
                   You're right, you're right. I
                   don't have too many excuses for
                   the first year... the second year
                   is easier... I was in jail.
      Hector is pleased with this.       A solid excuse.

                                THOMAS
                   What for?

                                 HECTOR
                   We were doing government work,
                   big contracts... there were some
                   temptations... my boss asked me
                   to shuffle a few papers... there
                   was a lot of money in it... I had
                   to testify against him... it was
                   like killing somebody.

      Hector thinks about this, remembering the pain. For us
      there is the echo of the real killing that was done long
      ago.
                                 BETSY
                   Thomas wanted to visit you in
                   jail, but Mom wouldn't let him.                        *
      Hector looks at Thomas.

                                HECTOR
                   You did?

      Thomas nods proudly.
                                 HECTOR
                   Well I appreciate that... but I'm
                   glad your mother didn't let you.
                   I'll tell you all about it some
                   day.  It was no fun. One year
                   and eight months.

                                 THOMAS
                   We didn't even know when you got
                   out.

                   didn't want you to see me then...
                   so I got back to work... in real

                   in jail...                                             *

                   Yes. We rent apartments... but
                   we want to get into commercial
                   property... people are a
                   nuisance... does that sound bad?
      Betsy shrugs her shoulders.

                   How should I know?
      Hector carries on with his story.

                   Just recently I've been feeling

      They have almost exhausted themselves in this first bout

      Hector is moved by the depth of her memory, her pain.

                                 HECTOR
                   I didn't leave because it was two
                   days before your test... it was
                   just what your mother and I
                   decided... I taught you how to
                   swim... we went to the pool twice
                   a week... why would I leave?
                                 BETSY
                   I know... that's what I mean...
                   why did you leave just then?
      Hector looks at Betsy. She is beginning to cry silently.
      He puts a tentative arm around her shoulder.
                                 HECTOR
                   Oh, God, Betsy. I'm sorry.

      Betsy is still crying.
                                 BETSY
                   It doesn't matter.

                                 HECTOR
                   How did you do, in the test?
                                BETSY
                   I passed.
      Hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder. It is too                *
      soon for gestures of emotion. After a long moment she
      speaks.
                                 BETSY
                   I'm a life-saver now.

      Hector doesn't make the obvious comment. His emotions
      are full. He hides his feelings in a gruff call to
      Thomas.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hey, Thomas! We're going home...
                   we're having a barbecue... Betsy
                   said she'll even let me eat a
                   steak!

                                 BETSY                                     *
                   Hurry up, Tom!                                          *

      Thomas breaks off from his play and runs towards them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Don't call him Tom, he doesn't
                   like it.

                                  BETSY
                   I'm allowed.
      Somehow Hector is touched by this.

                                 HECTOR
                   Your mother said it, when we
                   split up... don't lose the
                   children... didn't mean much at
                   the time. But she was right.

                                 BETSY
                   Who said I'd let you eat a steak?
      There is a silence.      Then Hector speaks.
                                   HECTOR
                   Betsy.    On Monday will you come
                   with me   when I take the flowers
                   back to   Anna? I can't face her
                   alone.    She wants to meet you
                   anyway.

                                  BETSY
                   Sure.
                                 HECTOR
                   You'll be there, right beside me?
                                 BETSY
                   I'd have to take the morning off
                   school.
                                  HECTOR
                   Is that bad?

                                 BETSY
                   No, that could be good...

      Betsy and Hector are quite close now.

                                 HECTOR
                   Just tell them you were with your
                   invisible dad.

                                                             152.        *

168   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                             168
      Hector and Betsy are walking on the shore.     Thomas tags
      along behind them.

                              BETSY
                What's she like? How did you
                meet her?

                              HECTOR
                The funny thing is I fell in love
                with her before I ever saw her...
                I smelled her... It was the day I
                got out of jail... I was on the
                train and she was sitting behind
                me... it was just this incredible
                perfume... remember I'd been
                inside for nearly two years with
                four hundred sweating males...
                She got off the train and I
                followed her... I couldn't help
                it... that's how good she is...
                she listened to a bum who followed
                her off a train...
      Betsy looks at him kindly.
                              HECTOR
                ... but she's still going to kill
                me on Monday...

      They share a laugh.   Betsy looks out to the ocean.
                              BETSY
                I think I'll paint the sunset
                tonight.
                              HECTOR
                It's just like a big pancake
                up there, isn't it?
      Betsy doesn't take the bait.   There is a silence.

                              HECTOR
                I remember when you two were tiny..
                I used to watch you sleeping... it
                was like now... I felt close to you,
                could touch you... but you weren't
                there... you were gone... dreamland
                ... just when I was closest to you,
                you weren't there... I felt it last
                night, too.

                              BETSY
                That's what it's like... you
                should know that.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'm not smart about things like
                   that, usually.
                                 BETSY
                   Don't be so tough on yourself.
                   You seem to want to be... you
                   don't have to...
                                  HECTOR
                   No?

                                 BETSY
                   No... we can do that...

      She smiles. Hector is out of his depth with this
      daughter of his.
                                 HECTOR
                   Is that a joke?
                                 BETSY
                   No, I mean it... look out for
                   yourself...
      Hector looks at her in wonderment. One of those moments
      when another human being stands before you and is an
      utter mystery.

                                  HECTOR
                   Who are you?   Who's inside
                   there?
                                 BETSY
                   You'll never know.
      Future generations of women are going to be just as
      unknowable to our Hectors as past ones were. Betsy
      moves off briskly along the beach. Hector trails
      after her, hooked.


169   EXT. BOAT - DAY                                              169
      Betsy and Thomas are in a small fragile rowboat, some
      distance from the shore. They are watching Hector who
      is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach.
      Another Hector and another pile of stones. This one
      is making a fire for the barbecue. These human rituals
      never stop.

                                 BETSY
                   I thought he was taller.

                   Well, it's been a while... you're
                   bigger.
                                 BETSY
                   I suppose so. He's getting fat,
                   too. I bet I could beat him at
                   the breast-stroke now.

170   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                              170

      Hector turns from his work. Out at sea the kids look
      small and vulnerable. Hector is more anxious than he
      should be, out of practice at fatherhood. He calls to
      them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Come on in, kids... that boat
                   doesn't look too safe...
      They call back to him.
                                 BETSY
                   We're fine!
      Hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the
      confidence yet, or something. He is edgy.

                                 HECTOR
                   I've just found you... I don't
                   want to lose you. What would I
                   tell your mother... come on in...

      He walks down to the water. The kids reluctantly pull
      on the oars and bring the little boat in. A few feet
      from the beach they hit some sand. The boat sticks.
      Hector wades out in his shoes so far. Then he calls
      to Thomas.
                                 HECTOR
                   Throw me the rope, Thomas, I'll
                   pull you in.
      Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector. It isn't
      attached to the boat. Hector ends up with all of the
      rope in his hands. He stands there, and they all laugh.
                                 HECTOR
                   This is one useless piece of
                   rope, Thomas...

      Just for a moment we have the image of our     Hector
      standing on the shoreline with a length of     rope. An
      image with an echo from six thousand years     ago. But
      this time Hector is laughing, and his kids     are safe.

                                                            155.         *

171   EXT. BEACH - SUNSET                                          171
      At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture
      it in a watercolor sketch. She has set up an easel on
      the beach. It's like action painting. She works
      frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips
      into the ocean. Tough little Betsy can even lose
      patience with the sun.

                              BETSY
                Why does it always go so fast...?
      Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen    her attempt this
      before. Hector has other concerns. He     is trying to
      light his barbecue. Match after match    disappears into
      his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out.

      The sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her
      easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas
      watch Hector trying to light the fire. After a while
      he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then
      he becomes a little self-conscious.
                              HECTOR
                I used to know how to do this...

      They laugh a little.
                              HECTOR
                I did... I used to be really
                good at this...
      He wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame.
      There's not much of the caveman about him now.


172   EXT. BEACH - DUSK                                            172
      It is a calm dusk. Hector is turning the meat on the
      barbecue. He is in a splendid frame of mind.
                              HECTOR
                Ah... smell it... the smell of
                civilization... scorched meat...
      Hector serves the chicken onto their plates. He sits
      down beside them with his steak, and a glass of wine.
      He watches Thomas attack his chicken, and smiles.

                              HECTOR
                I'd forgotten that... how you
                eat... dedicated... like it's
                your religion!

                              THOMAS
                Things I like.

                                 HECTOR
                   You used to hum to yourself too,
                   when you ate... like everything
                   was fine with the world.
      Thomas tries it out, eating and humming. It feels good
      to him. His head nods with the chewing and the tune.

                                 THOMAS
                   Hey, so I did... I'd forgotten
                   about that...

      The early stars are appearing in the sky. Hector lifts
      his eyes to a bright point low on the horizon.

                                 HECTOR
                   There she is... old Mercury...
                                 THOMAS
                   No... Mercury doesn't rise 'til
                   after midnight... that's Jupiter...
      Hector is impressed by his son.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'd forgotten... we used to watch                        *
                   the stars... you could tell me the                       *
                   names of all the planets... you                          *
                   could recite them like a poem...
                   remember... at the tiny window
                   upstairs in the old house?
                                THOMAS
                   No.
                                 HECTOR
                   Oh well, not to worry. I'm glad
                   you still like astronomy though.
                                 THOMAS
                   I'm not into star-gazing so much
                   ... we're working on computer
                   modelling... we're trying to make
                   a biosphere...

                   This is at school?

                                 THOMAS
                   Yeah. We're making such a mess of
                   the world, one day we're going to
                   have to take off for somewhere
                   else...
                                 HECTOR
                   Sounds like Donald said that...

      Hector realizes how far his kids have travelled from
      him. He looks at them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Well, I'm glad you two are thinking
                   about the old planet. I'm proud
                   of you. Look how beautiful
                   everything is. Sometimes I think
                   it's people that make it all
                   wrong... we walk around with all
                   our problems...

      Betsy chimes in.
                                 BETSY
                   I don't know. If it wasn't for
                   us there'd be nobody around to
                   see it all.
      Hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire.
      We see the three of them in a WIDE SHOT, the evening sky
      now pulsing with more and more points of light. Hector's
      voice and laughter carry to us.
                                 HECTOR
                   Don't worry, you two... I'll tell
                   you... it's just a big, black
                   sheet up there with holes in it
                   so the light comes through...
                   that's the truth... the very
                   latest...
      Hector has come to rest, and found peace at last, however
      temporary, here on the beach, beneath the same stars that
      our first Hector wailed at six thousand years ago.
      On Monday he will face the music. The kids will go
      back home, Mrs. Philippopolis will have to be dealt with,
      and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers.
      In general, life will take over, on Monday. But at this
      moment of calm on the beach, let's leave him while he's
      ahead.

      Their voices ring out playfully across the expanse of
      darkening beach and light-laden sky.

                                 BETSY
                   Wait a minute... I know... the
                   whole universe is inside a speck
                   of dust that's lying in a ball of
                   fluff in the cuff of a pair of
                   pants hanging over the back of a
                   chair...

                                 HECTOR
                   No... I'll tell you... the whole
                   thing... stars and everything...
                   is sitting on the skin of a bubble
                   of milk in a bowl of cornflakes...
                   and somebody's just about to eat

      Perhaps that's just about as close as Hector and his                *
      tribe of humans will ever come to working it all out.
      But they try.                                                       *

			 BEING JOHN MALKOVICH

		   A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman



	INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY

	The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	"Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
	sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
	opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.


									CUT TO:


	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


				 LOTTE
		    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
		    Hatch was out of his pen. Good
		    morning.


	Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

				 CRAIG
		    Morning.

				 LOTTE
		    Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
		    coming in first thing.

				 CRAIG
		    Enjoy.

				 LOTTE
		    Craig, listen, honey, I've been
		    thinking... maybe you'd feel better
		    if you got, you know, a job or
		    something.

				 CRAIG
		    We've been over this. Nobody's
		    looking for a puppeteer in today's
		    wintry economic climate.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, you know, maybe something else
		    until this whole puppet thing turns
		    around.

				 CRAIG
			    (bitterly)
		    The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
		    job.

				 LOTTE
			    (sighs)
		    Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
			    (beat)
		    Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
		    a favor?

				 CRAIG
		    What?

				 LOTTE
		    Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
		    to be a little under the weather this
		    morning.

				 CRAIG
		    Which one is Elijah again?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. Okay.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING

	The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
	A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
	The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
	version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
	wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
	above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
	His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
	a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
	puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
	would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
	the real Craigs brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
	puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
	brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
	device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
	collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
	its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
	around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
	off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
	kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
	on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
	background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
	his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
	working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
	The assembled crowd is enthralled.


				 TV ANNOUNCER
		    The crowd is enthralled as Derek
		    Mantini, arguably the greatest
		    puppeteer in the history of the 
		    world, performs "The Belle of
		    Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily
		    Dickinson puppet, directed by the
		    inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

	Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

				 CRAIG
		    Gimmicky bastard.

	Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
	female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs 
	his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Craig sees a personal ad: "Male puppeteer looking for
	attractive female puppeteer for friendship, travel, and
	much much more."  Craig rubs his chin, then thinks better
	of it and sighs. He finds a want ad calling for a
	"short-statured file clerk with unusually nimble and
	dexterous fingers needed for speed filing."  Craig writes
	down the address.

									CUT TO:

	INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

	Craig. in sport coat and tie, studies the business listings
	board. He finds LesterCorp, and sees that it is located on
	floor 7 1/2. Craig presses the elevator button and waits.
	Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open,
	and Craig and the other man get in.

									CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

	The other man presses "9." Craig studies the buttons. There

		    Uh. yeah.

				 WOMAN #1
		    I'll take you through it.

	The man picks up a crowbar leaning in the corner. He
	watches the floor numbers light up in succession. After
	"7" and before "8", the man hits the emergency stop button.
	The elevator slams to a halt. The man pries open the doors
	with the crowbar. Revealed is a standard office building
	hallway, except that from floor to ceiling it is only about
	four feet high. Everything is scaled down accordingly.
	The number on the wall across from the elevator is 7 1/2.

		    Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...

				 CRAIG
		    Schwartz.

				 FLORIS
		    Pardon?

				 CRAIG
		    Schwartz.

				 FLORIS
		    I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea
		    what you're saying right now.

				 CRAIG
		    My name is Schwartz.

				 FLORIS
		    Money, Miss Warts?

				 CRAIG
		    Forget it.

	Craig takes a seat next to the other applicants.

				 FLORIS
			    (calling across the room)
		    Fork ah did?

	The intercom buzzes. Floris picks it up.

				 FLORIS
			    (to Craig)
		    Mr. Juarez?

				 CRAIG
		    Yes?

				 FLORIS
		    Yex?

				 CRAIG
		    I said "yes."

				 FLORIS
		    You suggest what? I have no time for
		    piddling suggestions from mumbling job
		    applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr.
		    Lester will see you now. I think
		    that's what he said.

	Craig stands, opens Lester's door, and enters.

									CUT TO:

	INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Craig enters. Lester, a giant of an old man, sits hunched
	behind his tiny desk.

				 LESTER
		    Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but,
		    well, you know.

				 CRAIG
			    (extending his hand)
		    Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz,
		    Dr. Lester.

	Lester flips an intercom switch.

				 LESTER
		    Security.

				 CRAIG
		    No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with
		    your secretary.

				 LESTER
		    She's not my secretary. She's what
		    they call an executive liaison, and
		    I'm not banging her, if that's what
		    youre implying.

				 CRAIG
		    Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply
		    misspoke.

				 LESTER
		    Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
		    feel you can bring to LesterCorp?

				 CRAIG
		    Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

				 LESTER
			    (crafty)
		    You think so, eh? Which comes first,
		    L or... Glooph?	

				 CRAIG	
		    Glooph is not a letter, sir.	

				 LESTER	
		    Damn, you are good. I tried to trick
		    you. Okay, put these in order.

	Lester hands Craig a bunch of index cards. Craig orders
	them with amazing speed and dexterity. Lester watches,
	eyes wide.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
			    (flips intercom switch)
		    Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

				 FLORIS (O.S.)
		    Gehginnis ondah foam?

				 LESTER
		    Forget it.

				 FLORIS (CONT'D)
		    Fork ah did?

				 LESTER
			    (flips off switch)
		    Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how
		    she puts up with this damn speech
		    impediment of mine.

				 CRAIG
		    You don't have a speech impediment,

				 LESTER
		    Flattery will get you everywhere,

		    trust Floris on this one. You see,
		    she has her doctorate in speech
		    impedimentology from Case Western.
		    Perhaps you've read her memoirs,
		    "I can't understand a word any of
		    you are saying."

				 CRAIG
		    No.

				 LESTER
		    Pity, it tells it like it is.
		    That's why the eastern, read Jewish,
		    publishing establishment won't touch
		    it. That's a quote from the book
		    jacket. George Will, I think.
			    (beat)
		    I apologize if you can't understan
		    a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.

				 CRAIG
		    No. I understand perfectly.

				 LESTER
			    (choking up)
		    Thank you for being kind enough to
		    lie. You see, I've been very lonely
		    in my isolated tower of
		    indecipherable speech. You're hired.
		    Any questions?

				 CRAIG
		    Just one. Why is this floor so short?

				 LESTER
		    Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the

		    Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the

		    Hello, Don.

		    Hello. Wendy.

				 WENDY
		    Don, I was wondering, do you know
		    why our workplace has such low
		    ceilings?

				 DON
		    It's an interesting story, Wendy.
		    Many years ago in the late 1800's,
		    James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
		    looking to invest in the future of
		    our great country, came to this town
		    and decided to erect an office
		    building.

									CUT TO:

	OLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING.

				 DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)
		    He would call this building the
		    Mertin-Flemmer Building, after
		    himself and someone else, who, local
		    legend has it, was named Flemmer.

		    One day. Captain Mertin received an
		    unexpected visitor.

	There is a knock at the door.

				 MERTIN
		    Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

	A tiny woman enters.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin?

				 MERTIN
		    What want ye, girl child?

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
		    but rather an adult lady of miniature
		    proportions.

				 MERTIN
			    (taken aback)
		    I see. Well, it is not my fault that
		    thou art tiny. So if it is charity
		    yer after, then be gone with ye,
		    ye foul demon.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not asking for alms, but rather
		    the ear of a kind man with a noble
		    heart.

				 MERTIN
			    (sighs)
		    Aye. Speak then if ye must.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin, surely I am a
		    God-fearing Christian woman like
		    yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
		    the world was not built with me in
		    mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
		    are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
		    mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
		    lady, Captain. after all, who would
		    marry a person of my diminutiveness?
		    So I am forced to work for my few
		    pennies a week as an optometrist.
		    Why cannot there be a place for me
		    to work safe and comfortable?

	Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.

				 MERTIN
		    Woman, your story moves me like n
		    other. Me own sister was tiny and
		    then died. Therefore, I shall make
		    ye me wife. And I shall build a
		    floor in my building, between the
		    7th and 8th, which will be scaled
		    down, so from now on there shall
		    be at least one place on God's green
		    Earth that you and your accursed
		    kind can live in peace...

		    So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since

		    Interesting. Would you like to be

		    It's just, and I've never done

		    never felt this before for anyone,
		    not even my wife. My future is with
		    you, Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    You might want to check those tarot

	Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts
	his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he
	notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across
	it.

		    Another evil secret of the 7 1/2

	Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a

		    It better be.

	Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.

				 CRAIG
		    There's a tiny door in that empty

		    You see the world through John
		    Malkovich's eyes, then, after about
		    fifteen minutes, you're spit out into
		    a ditch on the side of The New Jersey
		    Turnpike.

				 MAXINE
		    Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is
		    John Malkovich?

				 CRAIG
		    He's an actor. One of the great
		    American actors of the 20th century.

				 MAXINE
		    What's he been in?

				 CRAIG
		    Lots of things. He's very well
		    respected. That jewel thief movie,
		    for example. The point is that this
		    is a very odd thing, supernatural,
		    for lack of a better word. It raises
		    all sorts of philosophical questions
		    about the nature of self, about the
		    existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
		    Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
		    right, is duality an illusion? Do
		    you see what a can of worms this
		    portal is? I don't think I can go
		    on living my life as I have lived
		    it. There's only one thing to do.
		    Let's get married right away.

				 MAXINE
		    Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

				 CRAIG
		    Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

				 MAXINE
		    Good. We'll sell tickets.

				 CRAIG
		    Tickets to Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

				 CRAIG
		    But there's something profound here,
		    Maxine, we can't exploit it.

				 MAXINE
		    Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going
		    to offer a partnership to you, but
		    this way it's more money for me.

				 CRAIG
		    You wanted to be partners with me?

				 MAXINE
			    (bored)
		    Sure. It'd be fun.

				 CRAIG
			    (pleased)
		    Really?
			    (then:)
		    But, Maxine, can of worms! End of

	the restaurant. We see her, but Malkovich doesn't single her
	out of the crowd. She looks around.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    Maxine!

	Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.

				 MAXINE
		    Hi. I'm so glad you decided to
		    come. I'm Maxine.

	Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes
	her hand.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm John. I didn't think I was going
		    to come, but I felt oddly compelled.
		    I have to admit I was a bit intrigued
		    by your voice.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    God, she's beautiful. The way she's
		    looking at me. At him. At us.

				 MAXINE
		    And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,
		    my voice is probably the least
		    intriguing thing about me.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    I've never been looked at like this
		    by a woman.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Can I get you a drink?

				 MAXINE
		    Whatever you're having.

	Craig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the
	window.

				 CRAIG
		    So how was it? What was he doing?

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging
		    around his apartment. I think he must
		    be a lonely man.

				 CRAIG
		    You see, men can feel unfulfilled,
		    too. I'm glad you're realizing that.
		    You shouldn't be so quick to assume
		    that switching bodies would be the
		    answer to all your problems.

				 LOTTE
		    You're right. You know I was thinking
		    that we should have Maxine over for
		    dinner. Since you two are partners
		    and all. It might be a nice gesture.

				 CRAIG
		    I don't know. There's some tension
		    between us. I'd hate to expose you to
		    that.

				 LOTTE
		    It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.
		    Well smoke a joint.
			    (dreamily)
		    Tensions will melt away.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating
	lasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an
	awkward silence.

				 LOTTE
			    (to Maxine)
		    Did you know that Eskimos have not
		    one, but fifty words for snow. It's
		    because they have so much of it.

				 CRAIG
		    After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

				 MAXINE
		    Ah.

				 LOTTE
		    After that I'll introduce you to my
		    favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an
		    ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood
		    trauma. But we're getting to the
		    bottom of it.
			    (whispers)
		    Psychotherapy.

	There is another silence.

				 MAXINE
			    (to no one in particular) 
		    The way I see it, the world is divide
		    into those go after what they want
		    and those who don't. The passionate
		    ones, the ones who go after what they
		    want, may not get what they want, but
		    they remain vital, in touch with
		    themselves, and when they lie on
		    their deathbeds, they have few
		    regrets. The ones who don't go
		    after what they want... well, who
		    gives a shit about them anyway?

	Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the
	same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and
	start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
	They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.

				 CRAIG
		    You?

	Lotte looks away.

				 MAXINE
		    Craig, I just don't find you
		    attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten
		    with you, but only when you're in
		    Malkovich. When I looked into his
		    eyes last night, I could feel you
		    peering out. Behind the stubble and
		    the too-prominent brow and the male
		    pattern baldness, I sensed your
		    feminine longing peering out, and
		    it just slew me.

				 CRAIG
			    (disgusted)
		    My God.

	Lotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the
	table.

				 MAXINE
			    (to Lotte, removing her hand)
		    Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. 
			    (gets up)
		    Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
			    (walks past kitchen. to Craig)

	Maxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door.

				 CRAIG
			    (a little too urgently)
		    Come in!

	Erroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly.

				 ERROLL
		    Hello, I'm here about the ad.

				 CRAIG
		    Please, have a seat.

	Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He
	glances nervously over at Maxine.

				 ERROLL
		    When you say, I can be somebody
		    else, what do you mean exactly?

				 CRAIG
		    Exactly that. We can put you inside 
		    someone else's body for fifteen minutes.

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, this is just the medical
		    breakthrough I've been waiting for.
		    Are their any side effects? Please

				 MAXINE
		    No.

				 ERROLL
		    Long term psychic or physiological
		    repercussions?

				 MAXINE
		    No. Don't be an ass.

				 ERROLL
		    Can I be anyone I want?

				 MAXINE
		    You can be John Malkovich.

				 ERROLL
		    Well that's perfect. My second
		    choice. Ah, this is wonderful.
		    Too good to be true! You see, I'm
		    a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh,
		    I've tried all the diets, my friends.
		    Lived for a year on nothing but

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, thank you! Thank you!

				 CRAIG
			    (gasping for air)

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, I will, and I have many,

	Craig kneels at the door and peeks out through the mail

				 CRAIG
		    This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!

				 MAXINE
		    So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.

	Craig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door
	behind him, locks it.

				 LESTER
		    You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.
			    (nods to Maxine)
		    Ma'am

				 CRAIG
		    Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're
		    talking about.

				 LESTER
		    There are rules, boy, procedures,
		    etiquette. This is not a toy. I've
		    been waiting seventy years to utilize
		    this room, grooming myself, quietly
		    setting the stage, performing
		    ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all
		    his motion pictures again and again.
		    Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping

				 CRAIG
		    You're insane.

				 LESTER
		    I am not alone. There are others. We

		    Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been

				 CRAIG
		    What?

				 LOTTE
		    I'm getting rid of the animals. I've

		    No they're not.

	The digital clock on the VCR clicks over to 4:11 AM.

				 LOTTE

		    It was lovely being you being

		    then, dare I say it, if only I could

		    Something was making me talk. Some
		    Goddamn thing was making me move. I
		    gotta get out of here.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion
		    for me taking hold.

				 MALKOVICH
		    No, Dollface, I know what my passion
		    taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

	He leaves. Maxine falls back on the couch and sighs
	contentedly.

	A wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound
	and gagged.

				 CRAIG
		    I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm
		    across your girlfriend's glorious tit.
		    I made him talk. And, oh, there was
		    the beginning of sensation in the
		    fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a
		    matter of practice before Malkovich
		    becomes nothing more than another
		    puppet hanging next to my worktable.

	Malkovich paces nervously, a glass of whisky in his hand.
	Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a Rubic's

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's like nothing I've ever felt
		    before. I think I'm going crazy.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    I'm sure you're not going crazy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Kevin, I'm telling you... it was
		    like nothing I've...

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.
		    Were you stoned?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes, but you see, someone else was
		    talking through my mouth.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You were stoned. Case closed. End
		    of story. How hot is this babe?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I think it might've been this Lotte
		    woman talking through me. Maxine
		    likes to call me Lotte.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you
		    to channel some dead lesbian lover.
		    Let me know when you're done with her.
		    This is my type of chick.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm done with her now. Tonight really
		    creeped me out.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You're crazy to let go of a chick who
		    calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a
		    friend.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I don't know anything about her. What
		    if she's some sort of witch or
		    something?

				 KEVIN BACON
		    All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian
		    Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy.
		    Ha ha ha.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I gotta know the truth, Kevin.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

	Malkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against
	the wall. After a moment, Maxine emerges from the building
	and walks down the block. Malkovich follows at a safe
	distance.

									CUT TO:

	INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - MORNING

	The elevator doors are pried open. It's packed. Maxine and
	a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is
	Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor.
	He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat
	people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door.
	Maxine sees "J.M. Inc." stenciled on the office door. He
	turns to the first fat man and line.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Excuse me, what type of service does
		    this company provide?

				 FAT MAN
		    You get to be John Malkovich for
		    fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (quietly flipped)
		    I see.

				 FAT MAN
		    No cutting, by the way.

	Malkovich pounds on the door.

				 FAT MAN (CONT'D)
		    No cutting!

	Several fat people jump on Malkovich, and start beating
	him. Craig steps out of the office.

				 CRAIG
		    Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
		    Everybody gets a chance to be...

	The fat people climb off Malkovich. His glasses and cap
	have been knocked off and everyone recognizes him.

				 FAT MAN
		    It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr.
		    Malkovich! I hope me and my
		    associates from Overeaters Anonymous

		    Darling!

				 MALKOVICH
		    What the fuck is going on?

				 CRAIG
		    Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig
		    Schwartz. I can explain. We operate
		    a little business her that...
		    simulates, for our clientele, the
		    experience of... being you, actually.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Simulates?

				 CRAIG
		    Sure, after a fashion.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try.

				 CRAIG
		    You? Why I'm sure it would pale in
		    comparison to the actual experience.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try!

				 MAXINE
		    Let him try.

				 CRAIG
		    Of course, right this way, Mr.
		    Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

	Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (repulsed by the slime)
		    Jesus.

	Malkovich climbs in. The door closes.

				 CRAIG
		    What happens when a man climbs

									CUT TO:

	PSYCHEDELIC MONTAGE

	We see Malkovich hurtling through different environments.
	It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored
	lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet
	clown paintings.

									CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's
	wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is
	also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the
	restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes.
	Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the
	table looks at him seductively, winks and talks.

				 GIRL MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
		    Malkovich...

	Malkovich looks confused. The Malkovich waiter approaches,
	pen and pad in hand, ready to take their orders.

	Malkovich looks down at the menu. Every item is "Malkovich."
	He screams:

				 MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich!

	The waiter jots it down on his pad.

				 WAITER MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich.

	Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for
	the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich
	is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a
	'40's style big band of Malkoviches.

	EXT. DITCH - DAY

	Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting
	there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World
	in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is
	huddled and shivering and soaking wet.

				 CRAIG
		    So how was it?

				 MALKOVICH
		    That... was... no... simulation.

				 CRAIG
		    I know. I'm sorry...

				 MALKOVICH
		    I have been to the dark side. I have
		    seen a world that no man should ever
		    see.

				 CRAIG
		    Really? For most people it's a rather
		    pleasant experience. What exactly did
		    you...

				 MALKOVICH
		    This portal is mine and must be sealed
		    up forever. For the love of God.

				 CRAIG
		    With all respect, sir, I discovered
		    that portal. Its my livelihood.

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see
		    you in court!

	Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike.

				 CRAIG
			    (calling after him)
		    And who's to say I won't be seeing
		    what you're seeing... in court?

	Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.

				 MOTORIST
		    Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!

	Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car
	and hits him on the head.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants.
	He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She
	looks haggard.

				 LOTTE
		    Once this was a relationship based
		    on love. Now you have me in a cage
		    with a monkey and a gun to my head.

				 CRAIG
		    Things change. Anyway, you gave up your
		    claim to that love the first time you
		    stuck your dick in Maxine.

				 LOTTE
		    You fell in love with her first.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah but I didn't do anything about
		    it. Out of respect for our marriage.

				 LOTTE
		    You didn't do anything about it out
		    of respect for the fact that she
		    wouldn't let you near her with a ten
		    foot pole, which is, by the way,
		    about nine feet, nine inches off
		    the mark anyway.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what
		    have I become? My wife in a cage
		    with a monkey. A gun in my hand.
		    Betrayal in my heart.

				 LOTTE
		    Maybe this is what you've always
		    been, Craig, you just never faced
		    it before.

				 CRAIG
		    Perhaps you're right. I can't let
		    you go though. Too much has happened.
		    You're my ace in the hole.

				 LOTTE
		    I need a shower.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm
		    some kind of monster. I'm the guy
		    you read about in the paper and go,
		    "he's some kind of monster."

				 LOTTE
		    You're not a monster, Craig. Just
		    a confused man.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you so much.

	She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    But I gotta go now. I've got to go
		    be Johnny.

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

				 LOTTE
		    We have to meet.

				 MAXINE
		    One hour.

	Craig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth.

				 CRAIG
		    I'll tell you all about it when I
		    get home.

	Craig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands
	Elijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly
	watches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow.
	Something is going on in his brain. We move slowly into
	his eyes.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

	It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed
	out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa."
	The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We
	watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari
	suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The
	chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie
	them up. The safari men laugh.

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Well, there monkeys ain't going
		    nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
		    brews 'fore the boss comes back...

	The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend
	from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One
	of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.

				 CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Son, untie your mother and me!
		    Quickly! Before the great bald
		    chimp-men return.

	A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and
	struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two
	speaks.

				 CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Hurry, Elijah!

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Why you little bastard!

	Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the
	ropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He
	works furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her
	mouth.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!

	Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks
	the cage, and dials the phone.

				 LOTTE
		    Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me
		    in John the last three times. Craig's
		    had me locked up in the apartment. He
		    made me call you at gunpoint. It's
		    been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
			    (beat, calmly)
		    Really? Well, you know, he's quite
		    good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
		    a session with Malkovich I have to
		    attend. I'll speak with you soon.

				 LOTTE
		    But Maxine, I thought it was me you
		    loved.

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    I thought so too, doll. I guess we
		    were mistaken.

	Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.

				 LOTTE
		    Hello, Dr. Lester?

									CUT TO:

	INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands
	there, dressed in an evening gown.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Come on in.

				 MAXINE
		    I can explain about the portal,
		    darling.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
		    just let you up here to tell you
		    that, and to tell you that I'm taking
		    you and Schwartz to court.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh shut up.
			    (beat)
		    Craig, darling are you in there?

	Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward,
	puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be
	against him will.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes. How did you know it was me?

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte called me.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Oh, so the bitch escaped.

				 MAXINE
		    Apparently you can control this
		    Malkovich fellow now.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm getting better all the time.

				 MAXINE
		    I'll say you are. Let's do it on his
		    kitchen table, then make him eat an
		    omelette off of it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich)
		    No... damn... you...
			    (as Craig)
		    Oh shut up, you overrated sack of

	Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind
	while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig)
	laughs wildly.

	Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi

	hollow-eyed.

				 LESTER
		    You know I think it pays to leave
		    juice-making to the trained
		    professionals. You look terrible,
		    my dear.

				 LOTTE
		    Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
		    Lester.

				 LESTER
		    Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
		    inform you that I find that highly
		    arousing.

				 LOTTE
		    No, you don't understand. I've been
		    inside Malkovich when I'm with
		    Maxine...

				 LESTER
			    (slaps Lotte furiously)
		    What?! That is not allowed. My God,
		    you are supposed to be one of us.
		    You know you must never partake of
		    Malkovich by yourself!

				 LOTTE
		    No, I didn't know that.

				 LESTER
		    Oh, didn't anyone show you the

				 LOTTE
		    No.

				 LESTER

									CUT TO:

	INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

	Lotte site next to Lester in the darkened auditorium.
	The projector whirs. The screen lights up.

	TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH

	A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black
	and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.

				 LESTER ON FILM
		    Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.
		    As you may already know, today a
		    baby was born into this sad world.

	We see a shot of a newborn.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    His name is John Horatio Hannibal
		    Malkovich. And we are the keepers
		    of the door to his soul. One day,
		    when his brain is big enough, we
		    will all journey into his head and
		    live there for all eternity. Following
		    the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
		    we will build the ultimate communist
		    community, one body and hundreds,
		    maybe thousands, of brains inside
		    working together to form a super
		    human intellect capable of curing
		    disease, stopping all war, and
		    ruling the world with a benevolent
		    fist. We will take a wife, a woman
		    of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
		    is, as yet, still an infant herself.

	We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
	her hair.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
		    DeMent.

				 LOTTE
		    Does Floris know that she's the
		    chosen?

				 LESTER
		    Well, I tried to explain it to her,
		    but...

	Lester points to his ear and shrugs.

	Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
	relaxed.

				 MAXINE
		    You still there, sweets?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
		    on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
		    it's all in the wrists.

				 MAXINE
		    Wow.
			    (little girl pout)
		    Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

				 MALKOVICH
		    You mean with Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    I'd love to see your work.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (pleased)
		    Really? Yeah. Okay.

	Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    I'll do something I call "Craig's
		    Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

	Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
	did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
	complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
	He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

				 MAXINE
			    (moved)
		    That was incredible. You're brilliant!

				 MALKOVICH
		    You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
		    with dolls.

				 MAXINE
		    You're right, my darling, it's
		    so much more. It's playing with
		    people!

	Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

				 MAXINE
		    Stay in him forever?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, screaming)
		    No!
			    (as Craig, calmly)
		    But how will we make a living,
		    my love, if our clientele doesn't
		    have access to our product?

				 MAXINE
		    Well, we'll have all the money in
		    Malkovich's bank account, plus he
		    still gets acting work occasionally.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, breaking through)
		    No! Please!
			    (as Craig, to Malkovich)
		    Shut up, will you? We're trying to
		    think here.
			    (to Maxine)
		    It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
		    I like that about it.

				 MAXINE
		    No one would ever have to know its
		    not him.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (an idea)
		    Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
		    What if we presented Malkovich as the
		    world's most complicated puppet and
		    me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
		    enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor
		    with the Great Mantini!

				 MAXINE

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.

				 MAN #2
		    Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say
		    it's time.

				 LESTER
		    Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're

		    a bit. We will enter the portal
		    tonight!

	Everyone cheers.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal
	with cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the
	office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops
	just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (Craig to Malkovich)
		    Shut up!
			    (to Maxine)
		    Sorry, dear, I lost control for
		    a minute.

				 MAXINE
			    (kissing him)
		    It's okay, my sweet.

	They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
	of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
	open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
	in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

				 LESTER
		    Aaaahhhh, the portal!

				 LOTTE
			    (to Malkovich)
		    You bastard!

	Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds
	her back.

				 LESTER
		    No! Don't harm the vessel!

				 LOTTE
		    It's Craig in there, I can tell.

				 LESTER
		    I understand, but we must protect
		    the vessel at all costs.
			    (to Malkovich)
		    Please, Craig, please step aside
		    and allow us to have what is
		    rightfully ours.

				 CRAIG
		    Squatter's rights, Lester.

	Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
	through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
	triumphantly over at Lotte.

				 MAXINE
		    Now excuse us, we have an
		    entertainment legend to create.

				 LESTER
			    (to the cult members)
		    Clear the way for them, my friends.
		    They will be dealt with in due time.

	The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine
	exit.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Now, let's see what we can do to
		    salvage this portal... for the sake
		    of all that is good.

	The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
	begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
	Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and
	skin on the rough gray surface.

		    Oh yeah, he's good.

				 MALKOVICH
		    ... and I want to show off his skills
		    by performing a one-puppet
		    extravaganza in Reno.

				 MAXINE
		    Vegas.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Vegas. Can you arrange that?

				 AGENT
		    Sure, sure. Just let me make a
		    couple of calls.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The cult members are still there, now with picks 
	shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is
	excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2
	emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.

				 MAN #2
		    That's the last of it, boss.

	Lester peers through the door.

				 LESTER
		    Well, let's see what we've got
		    here.

	Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind
	him.

									CUT TO:

	INT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS

	Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a
	flash of light.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BUNKER - DAY

	The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.
	There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester
	views the scene through somebody's POV.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    My God, where am I? This seems so
		    familiar.

	The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!
		    Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!

				 DIRECTOR
		    Cut!

	We look over to see a director and camera crew.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    Oh, I'm just the actor in that
		    Twilight Zone episode.

	There is a popping sound.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. DITCH - DAY

	Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is
	waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly
	shakes his head "no."

									CUT TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY

	The cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.
	Lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at
	the ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.

				 LESTER
		    Thank you all for your efforts,
		    but I'm afraid we can no longer get
		    into Malkovich through the portal.

				 LOTTE
			    (panicky)
		    Why not? I need to get in there!

				 LESTER
		    I'm not certain, my dear, but I
		    believe your husband has somehow
		    psychically diverted the route.

				 LOTTE
		    That bastard! I'll gladly dispose
		    of him in the name of the order, Son
		    of Malkovich.

				 LESTER
		    I'm afraid that no physical harm
		    must come to him as long as he
		    inhabits the vessel.

				 MAN #3
			    (raises hand)
		    Oooh, I got an idea! What if we
		    build another portal to Malkovich,
		    like around back, and sneak in that
		    way?

				 MAN #4
		    Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
		    a portal, dummy, and he's dead!

				 LESTER
		    Actually, my friends, I suppose its
		    time I told you, I'm Captain James
		    Mertin.

	The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes
	some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
	a board. He then rearranges them for a while.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    You see, Lester is an anagram for
		    Mertin.

	Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little
	tense now.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    It used to work, I'm sure of it.

	Several members check their watches.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

	L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
	from the board to face the congregation.

				 MAN #3
		    How can this be? I thought you were
		    only one hundred and five years old.
		    Mertin would have to be...

				 LESTER
			    (chuckles amiably)
		    I'm two hundred and five, truth be
		    told.

				 WOMAN #1
			    (flirtatiously)
		    You don't look a day over one
		    hundred and five, Captain. What's
		    your secret?

				 LESTER
		    Lots of carrot juice, little lady.
		    That, and a deal with the Devil.

	There is a lot of murmuring in the room now.

				 MAN #2
		    So what exactly are you saying? Are
		    we in cahoots with the Dark Master
		    here?

				 LESTER
		    Surprise.

	The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
		    into Malkovich, we still get to rule
		    the world, just like I told you. The 
		    only difference is that we rule in the
		    name of evil, instead of good.

	People stop in their tracks.

				 MAN #3
		    That's the only difference?

				 LESTER
		    Absolutely.

	The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    So anyway...

	Lotte stands.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, I for one, am resigning. I will
		    not serve evil. I am ashamed of all
		    of you.

	Lotte heads for the door.

				 LESTER
		    My dear, let me assure you that when
		    we attain power, it will be much more
		    pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
		    than for those outside.

	Lotte stops and turns.

				 LOTTE
		    I'll take my chances.

	She exits.

				 LESTER
		    Anybody else?

				 WOMAN #1
		    Do we get to wear a crown?

				 LESTER
		    But of course.

				 WOMAN #1
		    Count me in.

				 LESTER
		    Good. I think its time to beckon
		    Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us
		    out of this pickle.

									FLIP TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER

	Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and
	blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch
	him.

				 FLEMMER
		    Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,
		    I didn't anticipate this.

				 LESTER
		    And as I said, sir, we can't very
		    well exert physical persuasion upon
		    the sacred vessel Malkovich.

				 FLEMMER
		    Right, Lester. I heard you the first
		    time. I'm not a dummy.

				 LESTER
		    Didn't mean to imply that you were,
		    sir.

				 FLEMMER
		    Look, I'm going back to my house
		    to ponder this. So stay calm and
		    keep track of Schwartz's comings
		    and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose
		    of Schwartz's wife, will you?
			    (to cultists)
		    Nice to meet you all.

	The cult members ad-lib "same here, sir."

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly
	sobbing. The caged animals watch her.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're
		    not human. People are treacherous
		    and greedy and corrupt. I've lost
		    my heart to two of them and I almost
		    lost my soul to another. And I'm no
		    better. Look at the way I keep you,
		    locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.
		    Well, I've been in a cage too, my
		    friends. Literally and figuratively.
		    So tonight I set you free.

	Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks
	all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their
	cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until
	she is alone.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Good-bye, friends.

	A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still
	there and holding her hand. She smiles.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Hello, friend

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted
	street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns
	the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and
	Lotte's building.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.
	The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.

				 LOTTE
		    They've come to kill me, Elijah. See,
		    I know too much. I should get the
		    door. It's impolite to keep death
		    waiting.

	Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.
	Then he leads her by the hand out the window.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT

	The marquee reads:  World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig
	Schwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich.

									CUT TO:

	INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

	Malkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the
	dressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number,
	reclines on the couch.

				 MAXINE
		    This is it, lover. You're stepping
		    onto that stage a nobody and
		    presto-change-o, you're coming
		    back the greatest puppeteer the
		    world has ever seen.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting
		    me hard today.

	Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.

				 MAXINE
		    Doesn't he know how important
		    tonight is to us?

				 MALKOVICH
		    He's a selfish bastard.

									CUT TO:

	INT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT

	The house is filling with formally dressed audience members.
	The cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among
	them. The lights go down.

				 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		    Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
		    great privilege of the Luxor hotel
		    and Casino to present Craig Schwartz
		    and his magical puppet John
		    Malkovich.

	The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.

				 LESTER
		    Blasphemous bastard.

	Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly
	nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
			    (grudgingly)
		    Pretty good though.

	Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
	knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today
	Goodbye."  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
	with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
	with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
	appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
	him.

				 USHER
		    Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting
		    you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid
		    there's not an empty seat in the
		    entire house.

				 MANTINI
			    (not taking his eyes from the stage)
		    Make one empty.

				 USHER
		    Y-y-y-es sir.

	The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
	Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
	performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The
	Waterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

				 LESTER
		    Not too shabby.

	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
	juggling chainsaws.

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

	At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich
	a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the
	cultists get up.

									CUT TO:

	INT. SEWER - NIGHT

	Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up
	against the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of
	her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying
	supplies:  food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket
	and sits down next to her.

				 LOTTE
		    They're going to take over the
		    world, Elijah. Evil will reign.
		    But, then, evil already reigns,
		    doesn't it? So what difference
		    does it make if John Malkovich
		    is wearing the fucking crown while
		    it's reigning?

	Elijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is
	returning.

									CUT TO:

	INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	It's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment.
	Looks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls
	are lined with books. Mr. Flemmer sits at his desk, his
	head in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.

				 FLEMMER
		    It's open.

	The door opens and Lester pokes his head in.

				 LESTER
		    It's just me, boss. I brought
		    croissants.

	Lester enters with a greasy white paper bag.

				 FLEMMER
		    Have a seat. I wracking my brain
		    over this Malkovich thing.

				 LESTER
		    We saw his show at the Luxor last
		    night.

				 FLEMMER
			    (impressed)
		    Vegas? What'd you think?

				 LESTER
		    The kid's got talent. You've never
		    seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz
		    had him up there singing and dancing.
		    Impressions.

				 FLEMMER
		    Impressions? Those are hard.

				 LESTER
		    Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad
		    we can't kill him.

				 FLEMMER
		    I suppose I could come to him in a
		    dream. I don't know. That's the best
		    I can think of right now.

				 LESTER
		    A scary dream?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
		    dream.

				 LESTER
			    (noncommittally)
		    I like that.

									CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	Malkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is
	surrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking
	champagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing
	table, brushing her hair.

				 MALKOVICH
		    They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz
		    is fantastic!"  The New York Times.
		    "If only Craig Schwartz had always
		    been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear
		    Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's
		    greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder,
		    WBAI Radio.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.
		    We're going to ride this straight to
		    the top.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sleepy suddenly.

				 MAXINE
		    Busy day, my little fire chief. Why
		    don't you climb into bed, and I'll
		    meet you there in just...

	But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of
	his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts 
	blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HELL - NIGHT

	Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of
	flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.
	He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away
	from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking
	the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister
	grin.

				 CRAIG
		    Who are you?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh.

				 FLEMMER
		    Leave Malkovich. He is mine.

				 CRAIG
		    Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.

									CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Malkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him.

				 MAXINE
		    Bad dream, darling?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I've got to leave Malkovich.

				 MAXINE
		    You've got to be kidding.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I just had the most horrifying
		    nightmare. The devil was in it.

	Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased
	with himself.

				 MAXINE
		    Malkovich is our meal ticket. You
		    can't back out because of some
		    stupid dream.

				 FLEMMER
			    (to himself)
		    Shit.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Honey, we can be happy and poor
		    together.

				 MAXINE
			    (laughs derisively)
		    Perhaps you'll want to consult that
		    Ouija board again.

	There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.

				 MAXINE (CONT'D)
		    Yeah what?!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Derek Mantini!

	Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and
	Maxine give each other the once over.

				 MANTINI
			    (still eyeing Maxine)
		    Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Did you see the reviews?

				 MANTINI
		    Yeah, I saw them

				 MALKOVICH
		    Because if you missed any, I just
		    happen to have copies here you can
		    take with you when you leave now.

				 MAXINE
		    I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
		    with Malkovich.

				 MANTINI
		    Very impressive. I could use a
		    producer with your vision. And
		    other outstanding attributes.

				 MALKOVICH
		    She's not available.

				 MANTINI
		    We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MAXINE
		    Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MANTINI
		    I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
		    more importantly, mine. Here's my
		    proposal: There's only room in this
		    world for one "World's Greatest
		    Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow
		    the puppet-going public to crown
		    their king.

				 MALKOVICH
		    How do we do that?

				 MANTINI
		    A friendly competition, if you will.
		    Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
		    Truman puppet appear opposite each
		    other in a play. Not some Vegas
		    Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
		    that requires actual acting. The
		    audience decides who is more deserving
		    of the title. The losing puppeteer
		    bows out graciously. Goes back to
		    obscurity as a file clerk.

				 MALKOVICH
		    What's the play?

				 MANTINI
		    Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Never heard of it.

				 MANTINI
		    Broadway's finest three hours. It's
		    about the suppression of the
		    individual. Conformity as God in
		    modern society.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing but acting to hide behind,
		    buddy-boy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
		    with the National Puppet Company's
		    production of "Long Day's Journey
		    Into Night."

				 MANTINI
		    Great then.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Is there dancing?

				 MANTINI
		    No.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Who needs dancing?

									CUT TO:

	INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Lester is watering Flemmer's plants. A key is heard in the
	door. Flemmer enters, a small carry-on bag slung over his
	shoulder.

				 LESTER
		    How'd it go? Did you say the
		    philodendron gets water or no?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, for God's sake, I just watered
		    it yesterday.
			    (beat)
		    It almost went well. I gave a pretty
		    good dream, but circumstances arose.

				 LESTER
		    What kind of circumstances?

				 FLEMMER
		    Maxine says she'll leave him if he
		    leaves Malkovich, plus he's been
		    challenged to a puppet-duel by
		    Mantini.

				 LESTER
		    The Great Mantini?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course
		    the Great Mantini!

				 LESTER
		    Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I
		    saw him do "Tru" with his sixty
		    foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

				 FLEMMER
		    But I think I have another plan.

				 LESTER
			    (snippy)
		    Do tell. I love a good plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Why are you being like this?

	Lester shrugs.

				 LESTER
		    I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me
		    the plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
		    leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
		    needs it, I help Mantini's performance
		    a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
		    show.

				 LESTER
		    Can you do that? I mean, do you know
		    anything about puppetry?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
		    handle it.

				 LESTER
		    I was just asking. No disrespect
		    intended.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. Let's drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. I mean, it's not like I was
		    doubting you, it's just that I know
		    puppetry is a skill that takes a long
		    time to acquire.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen
		    table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a
		    letter from Alex Trebek.

									CUT TO:

	INT. SEWER - NIGHT

	Lotte and Elijah, now dirty and drawn, are talking. Elijah
	uses sign language.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    You've got to tell Craig what's going
		    on. He must never leave Malkovich.

				 LOTTE
		    I'm glad you learned sign language,
		    Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging.
		    I'm tired of this conversation. I'm
		    tired period. What has the world ever
		    done for me that I should feel
		    personally responsible for saving it?

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    It is better to light one candle than
		    curse the darkness. I learned that
		    from you.

	Lotte turns away, shaken. A tear rolls down her face.

				 LOTTE
		    What have I become?

									CUT TO:

	EXT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT

	The Marquee reads: Derek Mantini's sixty-foot Harry S.
	Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John
	Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's "Equus."

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT

	The house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood
	planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and
	stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S.
	Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the
	flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman
	and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Do you dream often?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Do you?

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    It's my job to ask the questions.
		    Yours to answer them.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Says who?

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Says me. Do you dream often?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Do you?

	We see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	The dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the
	wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as
	a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the
	actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine.

				 MAXINE
			    (without turning around)
		    Keep your eyes in your pants, old
		    timer.

									CUT TO:

	INT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER

	It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves
	through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation.
	Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple:

				 THEATERGOER #1
		    That Truman puppet is downright
		    boring as the psychiatrist.

				 THEATERGOER #2
		    It's a wooden performance, really.
		    Get it? Wooden?

	Second couple:

				 THEATERGOER #3
		    What's with the Malkovich puppet?
		    He was much better in Vegas when he
		    played the piano with his feet.

				 THEATERGOER #4
		    I hate it when they try to stretch.
		    It's like Woody Allen.

	Third couple:

				 THEATERGOER #5
		    They both stink! I'm going across the
		    street to second act Miss Saigon.

									CUT TO:

	INT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	Malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror.
	Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights
	up a cigarette.

				 MAXINE
		    You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics,
		    lover, 'cause right now you're running
		    neck and neck with the dead president.
		    And you're both in last place.

	Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his
	head.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles
	Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    You're doing beautifully, my boy. I
		    wept at the speech about your wife.

	Flemmer materializes behind Mantini

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    What the hell? Nyong-nyong!

	Mantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break
	for it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in
	mid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he,
	too, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls
	for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his
	pocket.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT

	We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace
	as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to
	be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his
	movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's
	as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    I can hear the creature's voice. It's
		    calling me out of the black cave of
		    the Psyche. I shove in my dim little
		    torch, and there he stands -- waiting
		    for me. He raises his matted head. He
		    opens his great, square teeth and says
			    (mocking)
		    'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --
		    ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really
		    imagine you can account for Me?
		    Totally, infallibly, inevitably
		    account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'

	Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this
	bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and
	sees a silent, rapt crowd.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - A BIT LATER

	Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm.
	During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to
	upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising
	his ten foot eyebrows in surprise...

				 MALKOVICH
		    Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed!
		    Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming!
		    ... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!

									CUT TO:

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS

	A man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the
	street. She is dirty but determined.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL

	Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic
	convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the
	bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking
	it. Truman speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...
		    Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!
		    Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...
		    Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...
		    In. Out .. In ... Out ...

	Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the
	focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the
	crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.

				 AUDIENCE MEMBER
			    (to his wife)
		    That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine
		    actor.

				 FLEMMER
			    (blood boiling)
		    Bastard is stealing my thunder.

	Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,
	swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he
	talks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    All right! I'll take it away! He'll be
		    delivered from madness. What then?
		    He'll feel himself acceptable! What
		    then?

	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman
	out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on
	the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all
	fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.
	Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when
	he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll
		    erase the welts cut into his body by
		    flying manes.

	The audience "ooohs" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his
	clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from "Swan
	Lake." The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,
	now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and
	flying around the auditorium as he speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses
		    will be quite safe. You'll save your
		    pennies every week, till you can
		    change that scooter into a car...

	The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,
	in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes
	into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "Mr.
	Bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant
	swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns
	to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.
	Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just
	raised from the dead.

				 ACTUAL TRUMAN
		    Where am I? Aren't I dead?
			    (possessed)
		    Vote for Mantini!

	Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant
	puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a
	standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the
	catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him.
	Thunderous applause is heard in the background.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Good-bye, Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    Whatever.

	Malkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (weak but relieved)
		    I'm back! My nightmare is over.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

	Flemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds

	while shrieking a war cry.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.
	Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then
	by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with
	each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting
	out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich
	is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war
	cry and runs out onto the stage.

									CUT TO:

	INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.
	Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the
	audience.

				 MALKOVICH

		    I am your earthly king! Kneel before
		    me!

	The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to
	their knees.

				 CROWD
			    (like automatons)
		    Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.

	Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in
	the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.

	Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath
	figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the
	theater.

	FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

	CHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK

	Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but
	everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets,
	the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,
	carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody
	talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.
	There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
	theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
	movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
	about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
	jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
	and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his
	lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the
	street looks up.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (fifty voices)
		    Greetings, my lowly subjects.

				 FLORIS
		    Great things, my lonely subtext?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (rolls his eyes)
		    Boy, be careful what you wish for.
			    (to Floris)
		    Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
		    will you?

	Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
			    (to the people on the street)
		    I am bored. You will dance for your
		    king now.

	Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
	into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
	silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
	that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
	void of expression. Malkovich laughs.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    Faster! Faster, my little trained
		    monkeys!

	The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
	exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
	help, nobody dares.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
	tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
	in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:

	A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT

	This place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards,
	cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
	totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
	position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
	animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
	and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
	gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Must you take this terrible demon
		    on yourself, my love?

				 LOTTE
		    Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
		    Malkovich and destroy him from the
		    inside. If not me, who?

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    If there was any way I could go in
		    your place. But I'm only a monkey
		    and...

				 LOTTE
			    (puts finger to his lips)
		    Hush, sweetheart.

	Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
	on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
	embrace.

				 LOTTE
			    (to the animals)
		    I'll be with you always, my friends.
		    Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
		    rejoin you with wings and a beak.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
		    and a halo.

	Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
	into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.

				 PARROT
			    (softly)
		    Good-bye. Good-bye.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY

	A man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
	is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
	the others, and enters the building.

									CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
	the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
	She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
	door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
	and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS

	Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
	is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
	turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

				 LOTTE
		    My God!

				 CRAIG
		    I'm so glad you're safe. You look
		    really wonderful.

				 LOTTE
		    I'm in love. For the first time.
		    It's funny, but when it happens to
		    you, there's no question.

				 CRAIG
		    He's a lucky man.
			    (beat)
		    Do I know him?

				 LOTTE
		    It's Elijah.

				 CRAIG
		    The iguana?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
		    I'm sure he's a better lover than I
		    ever was.

				 LOTTE
		    A better friend.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    I'm sorry for everything.

				 LOTTE
			    (pecking him on the cheek)
		    It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
		    in an odd sort of way.

				 CRAIG
		    You came up here looking for the
		    portal?

				 LOTTE
		    Yeah. I was going to kill him from
		    the inside.

				 CRAIG
		    And yourself too in the process. God,
		    you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
		    see that before?

				 LOTTE
		    You saw it once. Now you see it again.
		    That's life, isn't it? And you were
		    up here to try the same thing, weren't
		    you?

				 CRAIG
		    I suppose. But they got here first,
		    the lousy bastards. So now it's all
		    over, I guess.

				 LOTTE
		    I don't know. There's a small
		    community of us. We have a place they
		    don't know about. We're happy. We'll
		    keep trying to figure out a way. Come
		    stay with us. Join the struggle.

				 CRAIG
		    You'll have me, after all I've done
		    to you?

				 LOTTE
		    People make mistakes.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
		    I just want you to know that.

				 LOTTE
		    I know.

				 CRAIG
		    I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
		    help things grow, to encourage life.
		    Do you and your friends need a farmer?

				 LOTTE
		    Sure. We could really use a farmer.
		    We'd be grateful for the help.
			    (beat)
		    Also, I think, you know, if you
		    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
		    puppet show every once in a while,
		    would do a lot to lift our spirits.
		    You know, if you wouldn't mind too
		    terribly.

	Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

	She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
	elevator.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you, Lotte.

	We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
	it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
	We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
	Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.

				 MANTINI
			    (in Craig's voice)
		    I can't wait to see where you and your
		    friends live, Lotte.

				 LOTTE (O.S.)
		    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

	Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
	follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

				 FLEMMER
		    One serpent, coming up.

	Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
	into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
	looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
	tunnel.

	THE END
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH

		   A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman



	INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY

	The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	"Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
	sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
	opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


				 LOTTE
		    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
		    Hatch was out of his pen. Good
		    morning.


	Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

				 CRAIG
		    Morning.

				 LOTTE
		    Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
		    coming in first thing.

				 CRAIG
		    Enjoy.

				 LOTTE
		    Craig, listen, honey, I've been
		    thinking... maybe you'd feel better
		    if you got, you know, a job or
		    something.

				 CRAIG
		    We've been over this. Nobody's
		    looking for a puppeteer in today's
		    wintry economic climate.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, you know, maybe something else
		    until this whole puppet thing turns
		    around.

				 CRAIG
			    (bitterly)
		    The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
		    job.

				 LOTTE
			    (sighs)
		    Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
			    (beat)
		    Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
		    a favor?

				 CRAIG
		    What?

				 LOTTE
		    Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
		    to be a little under the weather this
		    morning.

				 CRAIG
		    Which one is Elijah again?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. Okay.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING

	The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
	A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
	The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
	version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
	wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
	above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
	His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
	a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
	puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
	would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
	the real Craigs brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
	puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
	brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
	device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
	collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
	its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
	around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
	off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
	kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
	on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
	background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
	his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
	working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
	The assembled crowd is enthralled.


				 TV ANNOUNCER
		    The crowd is enthralled as Derek
		    Mantini, arguably the greatest
		    puppeteer in the history of the 
		    world, performs "The Belle of

		    Dickinson puppet, directed by the
		    inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

	Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

				 CRAIG
		    Gimmicky bastard.

	Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
	female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs 
	his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.

	Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open,
	and Craig and the other man get in.

	The other man presses "9." Craig studies the buttons. There

				 CRAIG
		    Uh. yeah.

				 WOMAN #1
		    I'll take you through it.

	The man picks up a crowbar leaning in the corner. He
	watches the floor numbers light up in succession. After
	"7" and before "8", the man hits the emergency stop button.
	The elevator slams to a halt. The man pries open the doors
	with the crowbar. Revealed is a standard office building
	hallway, except that from floor to ceiling it is only about
	four feet high. Everything is scaled down accordingly.
	The number on the wall across from the elevator is 7 1/2.

	Lester flips an intercom switch.

				 LESTER
		    Security.

				 CRAIG
		    No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with
		    your secretary.

				 LESTER
		    She's not my secretary. She's what
		    they call an executive liaison, and
		    I'm not banging her, if that's what
		    youre implying.

				 CRAIG
		    Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply
		    misspoke.

				 LESTER
		    Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
		    feel you can bring to LesterCorp?

				 CRAIG
		    Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

				 LESTER

				 CRAIG
		    You don't have a speech impediment,

				 LESTER
		    Flattery will get you everywhere,
		    my boy. But I'm afraid I have to
		    trust Floris on this one. You see,
		    she has her doctorate in speech
		    impedimentology from Case Western.
		    Perhaps you've read her memoirs,
		    "I can't understand a word any of
		    you are saying."

				 CRAIG
		    No.

				 LESTER
		    Pity, it tells it like it is.
		    That's why the eastern, read Jewish,
		    publishing establishment won't touch
		    it. That's a quote from the book
		    jacket. George Will, I think.
			    (beat)
		    I apologize if you can't understan

				 CRAIG
		    No. I understand perfectly.

				 LESTER
			    (choking up)
		    Thank you for being kind enough to
		    lie. You see, I've been very lonely
		    in my isolated tower of
		    indecipherable speech. You're hired.
		    Any questions?

				 CRAIG
		    Just one. Why is this floor so short?

				 LESTER
		    Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the

		    Hello. Wendy.

				 WENDY
		    Don, I was wondering, do you know
		    why our workplace has such low
		    ceilings?

				 DON
		    It's an interesting story, Wendy.
		    Many years ago in the late 1800's,
		    James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
		    looking to invest in the future of
		    our great country, came to this town
		    and decided to erect an office
		    building.

									CUT TO:

	OLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING.

				 DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)
		    He would call this building the
		    Mertin-Flemmer Building, after
		    himself and someone else, who, local
		    legend has it, was named Flemmer.

		    One day. Captain Mertin received an
		    unexpected visitor.

	There is a knock at the door.

				 MERTIN
		    Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

	A tiny woman enters.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin?

				 MERTIN
		    What want ye, girl child?

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
		    but rather an adult lady of miniature
		    proportions.

				 MERTIN
			    (taken aback)
		    I see. Well, it is not my fault that
		    thou art tiny. So if it is charity
		    yer after, then be gone with ye,
		    ye foul demon.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not asking for alms, but rather
		    the ear of a kind man with a noble
		    heart.

				 MERTIN
			    (sighs)
		    Aye. Speak then if ye must.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin, surely I am a
		    God-fearing Christian woman like
		    yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
		    the world was not built with me in
		    mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
		    are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
		    mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
		    lady, Captain. after all, who would
		    marry a person of my diminutiveness?
		    So I am forced to work for my few
		    pennies a week as an optometrist.
		    Why cannot there be a place for me
		    to work safe and comfortable?

	Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.

				 MERTIN
		    Woman, your story moves me like n
		    other. Me own sister was tiny and
		    then died. Therefore, I shall make
		    ye me wife. And I shall build a
		    floor in my building, between the
		    7th and 8th, which will be scaled
		    down, so from now on there shall
		    be at least one place on God's green
		    Earth that you and your accursed
		    kind can live in peace...

	Maxine laughs. The bartender approaches.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    What'll you have?

				 MAXINE
			    (to bartender)
		    The usual, Barry.

				 CRAIG
			    (to bartender)
		    I'll have, like, a beer. Like a
		    Budweiser, or something.

	The bartender walks away.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    I like you. I don't know what it
		    is exactly.

				 MAXINE
		    My tits?

				 CRAIG
		    No, no, it's your energy or your
		    attitude or the way you carry
		    yourself or...

				 MAXINE
		    Christ, you're not a fag are you?
		    Because I don't want to be wasting
		    my time.

	The drinks arrive. Maxine's is in an enormous fishbowl of
	a glass. It's bright blue, with fruit and marshmallows
	swimming in it. Paper umbrellas stick out of it, an
	plastic monkeys hang from the rim.

				 CRAIG
		    That's the usual?

				 MAXINE
		    Dont let the girly shit fool you.
		    It'd blow your shorts off.

	Maxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the
	empty glass to the bartender.

				 MAXINE (CONT'D)
		    Set me up again, Barry.

	The bartender walks away with the empty glass.

				 CRAIG
		    Im not a homosexual. I just like
		    women for more than their bodies.
		    I guess you could say I'm the new
		    American male.

				 MAXINE
		    You're a fag or a liar.

				 CRAIG
			    (backpedaling)
		    I mean, I am really attracted to
		    you.

				 MAXINE
			    (mocking)
		    I mean, I am really attracted to
		    you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can
		    share recipes, if you like, Darlene.

	Maxine gets up.

				 CRAIG
			    (at a loss)
		    No, wait! I like your tits.
			    (beat)
		    I love your tits. I want to fuck
		    you.

				 MAXINE
			    (sitting)
		    Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
			    (beat)
		    Not a chance.

	Maxine's second drink comes. She downs it, pushes the
	glass toward the bartender.

				 MAXINE (CONTD)
		    So, tell me about yourself. If you
		    can get your mind out of the gutter
		    long enough, dog-boy.

				 CRAIG
		    Well, I'm a puppeteer...

	The bartender comes back with Maxine's drink.

				 MAXINE
			    (to bartender)
		    Check.

				 CRAIG
		    Hi.

				 LOTTE
		    Hi.

				 CRAIG
			    (nervous, talking too much)
		    Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just
		    wouldn't let me go. Were supposed
		    to have dinner with him on Friday.
		    I can get us out of it if you want.
		    He's really amazing, this insane old
		    lech. It's actually sort of amusing
		    when you get past just how disgusting
		    it is.

	There is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah.
	Finally:

				 LOTTE
		    Did you eat?

				 CRAIG
		    Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I
		    didn't call. It was just, you know,
		    hard to get away.

				 LOTTE
		    I was worried.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm sorry. How was your evening?

				 LOTTE
		    Tom-Tom's puncture wound is
		    infected.

				 CRAIG
		    The ferret?

				 LOTTE
		    The iguana.

				 CRAIG
		    Right.

				 LOTTE
		    I dressed the wound. Then I've
		    just been feeding everyone, putting
		    everyone to bed.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. You want a beer?

				 LOTTE
		    No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

				 CRAIG
		    All right. I'll be in my workshop
		    for a little while. I'll be in in

	Craig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets
	sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a
	pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice.

				 CRAIG
			    (as Maxine, fascinated)
		    Tell me, Craig, why do you love
		    puppeteering?
			    (as Craig)
		    Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.
		    Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
		    someone else for a little while.
		    Being inside another skin. Moving
		    differently, thinking differently,
		    feeling differently.
			    (as Maxine)
		    Interesting. Would you like to be
		    inside my skin, Craig? Think what I
		    think? Feel what I feel?
			    (as Craig)
		    More than anything. Maxine.
			    (as Maxine)
		    It's good in here, Craig. Better

		    You're not someone I could get
		    interested in. Craig. You play
		    with dolls.

				 CRAIG
			    (rehearsed)
		    Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea
		    of being inside someone else,
		    feeling what they feel, seeing
		    what they see...

				 MAXINE
		    Yikes.

				 CRAIG
		    Please, let me explain.

	Craig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty

	Craig pulls Maxine in closes the door.

				 CRAIG
		    It's just, and I've never done

		    that I feel something for you. I've
		    never felt this before for anyone,
		    not even my wife. My future is with
		    you, Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    You might want to check those tarot
		    cards one more time.

	Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts
	his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he
	notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across
	it.

				 CRAIG
		    Another evil secret of the 7 1/2
		    floor.

	Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a
	dark and wet membranous tunnel inside.

				 CRAIG

	Maxine heads for the door. Craig grabs her arm.

				 CRAIG
		    This is important!

				 MAXINE
			    (looking at his hand on her arm)
		    It better be.

	Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.

				 CRAIG
		    There's a tiny door in that empty
		    office. It's a portal, Maxine. It
		    takes you inside John Malkovich.
		    You see the world through John
		    Malkovich's eyes, then, after about
		    fifteen minutes, you're spit out into
		    a ditch on the side of The New Jersey
		    Turnpike.

				 MAXINE
		    Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is
		    John Malkovich?

				 CRAIG
		    He's an actor. One of the great
		    American actors of the 20th century.

				 MAXINE
		    What's he been in?

				 CRAIG
		    Lots of things. He's very well
		    respected. That jewel thief movie,
		    for example. The point is that this
		    is a very odd thing, supernatural,
		    for lack of a better word. It raises
		    all sorts of philosophical questions
		    about the nature of self, about the
		    existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
		    Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
		    right, is duality an illusion? Do
		    you see what a can of worms this
		    portal is? I don't think I can go
		    on living my life as I have lived
		    it. There's only one thing to do.
		    Let's get married right away.

				 MAXINE
		    Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

				 CRAIG
		    Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

				 MAXINE
		    Good. We'll sell tickets.

				 CRAIG
		    Tickets to Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

				 CRAIG
		    But there's something profound here,
		    Maxine, we can't exploit it.

				 MAXINE
		    Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going
		    to offer a partnership to you, but
		    this way it's more money for me.

				 CRAIG
		    You wanted to be partners with me?

				 MAXINE
			    (bored)
		    Sure. It'd be fun.

				 CRAIG
			    (pleased)
		    Really?
			    (then:)
		    But, Maxine, can of worms! End of
		    the world! Illusory nature of
		    existence!

				 MAXINE
		    I'll protect you, Dollface.

	between her thumb and forefinger.

		    I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't
		    that the craziest thing?

				 CRAIG
		    What, are you nuts? That's Oprah
		    talking.

				 LOTTE
		    Everything felt right for the first
		    time. I need to go back to make sure,
		    then if the feeling is still there.
		    I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman
		    about sexual reassignment surgery.

				 CRAIG
		    This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an
		    allergist. If you're going to do
		    something, do it right.

				 CRAIG (cont'd)
			    (beat)
		    It's just the thrill of seeing through
		    someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll
		    pass.

				 LOTTE
		    Don't stand in the way of my
		    actualization as a man, Craig.

				 MAXINE
			    (hanging up the phone)
		    Let her go, Craig. I mean him."

				 CRAIG
			    (anything for Maxine) 
		    Yeah, okay.
			    (opens the portal door) 
		    I'll pick you up.

	Lotte enters. Craig closes the door. stands there.

				 MAXINE
		    You better hurry. Traffic.

	Maxine tosses Craig his car keys. He heads out the door.
	Maxine dials the phone.

				 MAXINE (CONT'D)
			    (into phone)
		    Davey? Max. Get me John Malkovich's
		    home phone? That's great. Love ya

	INT. JOHN MALKOVICH'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Malkovich's POV. He sits on the couch. drinks coffee,
	and reads a copy of Awake and Sing. Bach plays on the
	stereo in the background.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (reading aloud)
		    So you believe in God... you got
		    something for it? You worked for
		    all the capitalists. You harvested
		    the fruit from your labor? You got
		    God!

				 LOTTE (V.0.)
		    What raw, animal power!

				 MALKOVICH
		    But the past comforts you? The
		    present smiles on you, yes?

	The phone rings. Malkovich puts down the script, and picks
	up the phone.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
			    (into phone)
		    Yeah?

				 MAXINE (0.S.)
			    (telephone voice) 
		    Mr. Malkovich?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Who's calling?

				 MAXINE (0.S.)
		    You don't know me, but I'm a great
		    admirer of yours.

				 MALKOVICH
		    How'd you get this number?

				 MAXINE (0.S.)
		    It's just that I fantasize about
		    you and, well, speaking to you
		    now has gotten me sort of excited
		    and...

				 LOTTE (0.S.)
			    (turned on)
		    Oh, I like this.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Listen, this is not amusing. Please
		    don't call here any...

				 MAXINE (0.S.) (giggling)
		    Ooh, such authority! NY nipples are
		    at attention, General Malkovich, sir.
		    So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at
		    eight. Please, please meet me there.
		    I just adored you in that jewel thief
		    movie...

	Malkovich hangs up the phone.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    My God!
			    (attempting thought control) 
		    Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
		    her there. Meet her there. Meet her
		    there...

	Malkovich goes back to his script.

				 LOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		    Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet

	Malkovich picks up a pen and writes: Bernardo's 8:00.

		    How was it?

				 LOTTE
		    I have to go back tonight. At eight

				 CRAIG
		    Why?

				 LOTTE
		    Don't crowd me, Craig.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BERNARDO'S - NIGHT

	Malkovich's POV. It's a busy Italian restaurant. Malkovich
	looks around, checks his watch: 8:03. A guy walks up to him.

				 GUY
		    Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes.

				 GUY
		    Wow. You were really great in that
		    movie where you played that retard.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Thank you very much.

				 GUY
		    I just wanted to tell you that. And
		    say thank you. I have a cousin that's
		    a retard, so, as you can imagine, it
		    means a lot to me to see retards
		    portrayed on the silver screen so
		    compassionately.

	The guy walks away. Malkovich scans the room. Maxine enters
	the restaurant. We see her, but Malkovich doesn't single her
	out of the crowd. She looks around.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    Maxine!

	Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.

				 MAXINE
		    Hi. I'm so glad you decided to
		    come. I'm Maxine.

	Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes
	her hand.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm John. I didn't think I was going
		    to come, but I felt oddly compelled.
		    I have to admit I was a bit intrigued
		    by your voice.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    God, she's beautiful. The way she's
		    looking at me. At him. At us.

				 MAXINE
		    And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,
		    my voice is probably the least
		    intriguing thing about me.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    I've never been looked at like this
		    by a woman.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Can I get you a drink?

				 MAXINE
		    Whatever you're having.

									CUT TO:

				INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Craig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the
	window.

				 CRAIG
		    So how was it? What was he doing?

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging
		    around his apartment. I think he must
		    be a lonely man.

				 CRAIG
		    You see, men can feel unfulfilled,
		    too. I'm glad you're realizing that.
		    You shouldn't be so quick to assume
		    that switching bodies would be the
		    answer to all your problems.

				 LOTTE
		    You're right. You know I was thinking
		    that we should have Maxine over for
		    dinner. Since you two are partners
		    and all. It might be a nice gesture.

				 CRAIG
		    I don't know. There's some tension
		    between us. I'd hate to expose you to
		    that.

				 LOTTE
		    It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.
		    Well smoke a joint.
			    (dreamily)
		    Tensions will melt away.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating
	lasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an
	awkward silence.

				 LOTTE
			    (to Maxine)
		    Did you know that Eskimos have not
		    one, but fifty words for snow. It's
		    because they have so much of it.

				 CRAIG
		    After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

				 MAXINE
		    Ah.

				 LOTTE
		    After that I'll introduce you to my
		    favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an
		    ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood
		    trauma. But we're getting to the
		    bottom of it.
			    (whispers)
		    Psychotherapy.

	There is another silence.

				 MAXINE
			    (to no one in particular) 
		    The way I see it, the world is divide
		    into those go after what they want
		    and those who don't. The passionate
		    ones, the ones who go after what they
		    want, may not get what they want, but
		    they remain vital, in touch with
		    themselves, and when they lie on
		    their deathbeds, they have few
		    regrets. The ones who don't go
		    after what they want... well, who
		    gives a shit about them anyway?

	Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the
	same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and
	start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
	They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.

				 CRAIG
		    You?

	Lotte looks away.

				 MAXINE
		    Craig, I just don't find you
		    attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten
		    with you, but only when you're in
		    Malkovich. When I looked into his
		    eyes last night, I could feel you
		    peering out. Behind the stubble and
		    the too-prominent brow and the male
		    pattern baldness, I sensed your
		    feminine longing peering out, and
		    it just slew me.

				 CRAIG
			    (disgusted)
		    My God.

	Lotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the
	table.

				 MAXINE
			    (to Lotte, removing her hand)
		    Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. 
			    (gets up)
		    Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
			    (walks past kitchen. to Craig)

	It is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks.
	The wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every

	Maxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door.

				 CRAIG
			    (a little too urgently)
		    Come in!

	Erroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly.

				 ERROLL
		    Hello, I'm here about the ad.

				 CRAIG
		    Please, have a seat.

	Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He
	glances nervously over at Maxine.

				 ERROLL
		    When you say, I can be somebody
		    else, what do you mean exactly?

				 CRAIG
		    Exactly that. We can put you inside 
		    someone else's body for fifteen minutes.

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, this is just the medical
		    breakthrough I've been waiting for.
		    Are their any side effects? Please
		    say no! Please say no!

				 MAXINE
		    No.

				 ERROLL
		    Long term psychic or physiological
		    repercussions?

				 MAXINE
		    No. Don't be an ass.

				 ERROLL
		    Can I be anyone I want?

				 MAXINE
		    You can be John Malkovich.

				 ERROLL
		    Well that's perfect. My second
		    choice. Ah, this is wonderful.
		    Too good to be true! You see, I'm
		    a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh,
		    I've tried all the diets, my friends.
		    Lived for a year on nothing but

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, thank you! Thank you!

				 MAXINE
		    So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.

	Craig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door

				 LESTER
		    You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.

		    Ma'am

				 CRAIG
		    Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're
		    talking about.

				 LESTER
		    There are rules, boy, procedures,
		    etiquette. This is not a toy. I've
		    been waiting seventy years to utilize
		    this room, grooming myself, quietly
		    setting the stage, performing

				 CRAIG
		    You're insane.

		    I am not alone. There are others. We

		    I have to see you.

				 MAXINE (V.O.)
		    Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's
		    business hours. I need to keep the
		    membranous tunnel open for paying
		    customers.

				 CRAIG
			    (sotto)
		    Tell her, what the hell, close
		    early today, live dangerously.

				 LOTTE
		    What the hell, darling. Close early
		    today, live dangerously.

				 MAXINE (V.O.)
		    Oooh, doll. I love this new
		    devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty,
		    I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll
		    see both of you in one hour.
		    Exactamundo.

	Maxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs
	it up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed,
	and motions with the gun for Lotte to enter.

				 LOTTE
			    (screaming)
		    Help! He's locking me in a cage!

	Craig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly.

				 NEIGHBOR
		    Shut up!

				 PARROT
		    Shut up!

				 CRAIG
		    Lesson number one:  Be careful what
		    you teach your parrot.

	Craig tapes Lotte's mouth, ties her hands and feet. Elijah
	watches him tie her. He becomes somewhat agitated, and
	holds his stomach.

	INT. BROADHURST THEATER - DAY

	Malkovich is rehearsing some business on stage. Maxine
	watches from the house. She anxiously checks her watch,
	then points to it so Malkovich can see.

		    Tommy, can I take fifteen?

	INT. MALKOVICH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	Malkovich and Maxine are having sex on the make-up table,

		    Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie...

	We now watch the scene from Malkovich's POV.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Maxine...

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Craig is toweling himself off, hurriedly combing his

				 CRAIG
		    You're glowing again.

				 MAXINE
		    A girl has a right to glow if
		    she wants. It's in the fucking

	Maxine sits. Craig smiles to himself.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

	Craig is feeding the various caged animals. He puts two
	plates of food in Elijah's cage. Lotte is ungagged and
	unbound now. She eats as Craig slumps down next to the
	cage, gun in hand.

				 CRAIG
		    It was lovely being you being
		    Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen
		    the passionate side of sweet Maxine
		    before, or her actual tits for that
		    matter. If only, I've been thinking
		    to myself, if only I could actually
		    feel what Malkovich feels, rather
		    than just see what he sees... And
		    then, dare I say it, if only I could
		    control his arms, his legs, his
		    pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

				 LOTTE
		    It'll never happen, fuckface.

				 CRAIG
		    Ah, but you're forgetting one thing,
		    Lambchop.

				 LOTTE
		    What's that?

				 CRAIG
		    I'm a puppeteer.

	Craig picks up the phone and dials. He smiles as he
	holds the receiver up to Lotte's face.

			    (tense, commanding)
		    Move right hand across her left breast
		    now. Move right hand across her left
		    breast now. Move right hand across her
		    left breast now.

	Malkovich clumsily, awkwardly moves his hand across Maxine's
	breast.

				 CRAIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		    Holy shit, yes!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Holy shit, yes!

				 CRAIG (V.O.)

		    What the fuck is going on? I'm not

	A panicked Malkovich is pulling on his clothes.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Something was making me talk. Some

		    gotta get out of here.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion
		    for me taking hold.

				 MALKOVICH
		    No, Dollface, I know what my passion
		    taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

	He leaves. Maxine falls back on the couch and sighs
	contentedly.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	A wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound
	and gagged.

				 CRAIG
		    I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm
		    across your girlfriend's glorious tit.
		    I made him talk. And, oh, there was
		    the beginning of sensation in the
		    fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a
		    matter of practice before Malkovich
		    becomes nothing more than another
		    puppet hanging next to my worktable.

	Malkovich paces nervously, a glass of whisky in his hand.
	Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a Rubic's

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's like nothing I've ever felt

				 KEVIN BACON
		    I'm sure you're not going crazy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Kevin, I'm telling you... it was
		    like nothing I've...

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.
		    Were you stoned?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes, but you see, someone else was
		    talking through my mouth.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You were stoned. Case closed. End
		    of story. How hot is this babe?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I think it might've been this Lotte
		    woman talking through me. Maxine
		    likes to call me Lotte.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you
		    to channel some dead lesbian lover.
		    Let me know when you're done with her.
		    This is my type of chick.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm done with her now. Tonight really
		    creeped me out.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You're crazy to let go of a chick who
		    calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a
		    friend.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I don't know anything about her. What
		    if she's some sort of witch or
		    something?

				 KEVIN BACON
		    All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

	Malkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against

	and walks down the block. Malkovich follows at a safe
	distance.

									CUT TO:

	INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - MORNING

	The elevator doors are pried open. It's packed. Maxine and
	a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is
	Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor.
	He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat
	people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door.
	Maxine sees "J.M. Inc." stenciled on the office door. He
	turns to the first fat man and line.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Excuse me, what type of service does
		    this company provide?

				 FAT MAN
		    You get to be John Malkovich for
		    fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (quietly flipped)
		    I see.

				 FAT MAN
		    No cutting, by the way.

	Malkovich pounds on the door.

				 FAT MAN (CONT'D)
		    No cutting!

	Several fat people jump on Malkovich, and start beating
	him. Craig steps out of the office.

				 CRAIG
		    Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
		    Everybody gets a chance to be...

	The fat people climb off Malkovich. His glasses and cap
	have been knocked off and everyone recognizes him.

				 FAT MAN
		    It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr.
		    Malkovich! I hope me and my

		    What the fuck is going on?

				 CRAIG
		    Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig
		    Schwartz. I can explain. We operate
		    a little business her that...
		    simulates, for our clientele, the
		    experience of... being you, actually.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Simulates?

				 CRAIG
		    Sure, after a fashion.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try.

				 CRAIG
		    You? Why I'm sure it would pale in
		    comparison to the actual experience.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try!

				 MAXINE
		    Let him try.

				 CRAIG
		    Of course, right this way, Mr.
		    Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

	Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (repulsed by the slime)
		    Jesus.

	Malkovich climbs in. The door closes.

				 CRAIG
		    What happens when a man climbs

	PSYCHEDELIC MONTAGE

	It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored

	clown paintings.

									CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's
	wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is
	also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the
	restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes.
	Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the
	table looks at him seductively, winks and talks.

				 GIRL MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
		    Malkovich...

	Malkovich looks confused. The Malkovich waiter approaches,
	pen and pad in hand, ready to take their orders.

	Malkovich looks down at the menu. Every item is "Malkovich."
	He screams:

				 MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich!

	The waiter jots it down on his pad.

				 WAITER MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich.

	Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for
	the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich
	is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a
	'40's style big band of Malkoviches.

	Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting
	there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World
	in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is
	huddled and shivering and soaking wet.

				 CRAIG
		    So how was it?

				 MALKOVICH
		    That... was... no... simulation.

				 CRAIG
		    I know. I'm sorry...

				 MALKOVICH
		    I have been to the dark side. I have
		    seen a world that no man should ever
		    see.

				 CRAIG
		    Really? For most people it's a rather
		    pleasant experience. What exactly did
		    you...

				 MALKOVICH
		    This portal is mine and must be sealed
		    up forever. For the love of God.

				 CRAIG
		    With all respect, sir, I discovered
		    that portal. Its my livelihood.

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see
		    you in court!

	Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike.

				 CRAIG
			    (calling after him)
		    And who's to say I won't be seeing
		    what you're seeing... in court?

	Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.

				 MOTORIST
		    Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!

	Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car
	and hits him on the head.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants.
	He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She
	looks haggard.

				 LOTTE
		    Once this was a relationship based
		    on love. Now you have me in a cage
		    with a monkey and a gun to my head.

				 CRAIG
		    Things change. Anyway, you gave up your
		    claim to that love the first time you
		    stuck your dick in Maxine.

				 LOTTE
		    You fell in love with her first.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah but I didn't do anything about
		    it. Out of respect for our marriage.

				 LOTTE
		    You didn't do anything about it out
		    of respect for the fact that she
		    wouldn't let you near her with a ten
		    foot pole, which is, by the way,
		    about nine feet, nine inches off
		    the mark anyway.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what
		    have I become? My wife in a cage
		    with a monkey. A gun in my hand.
		    Betrayal in my heart.

				 LOTTE
		    Maybe this is what you've always
		    been, Craig, you just never faced
		    it before.

				 CRAIG
		    Perhaps you're right. I can't let
		    you go though. Too much has happened.
		    You're my ace in the hole.

				 LOTTE
		    I need a shower.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm
		    some kind of monster. I'm the guy
		    you read about in the paper and go,
		    "he's some kind of monster."

				 LOTTE
		    You're not a monster, Craig. Just
		    a confused man.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you so much.

	She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    But I gotta go now. I've got to go

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

				 LOTTE
		    We have to meet.

				 MAXINE
		    One hour.

	Craig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth.

				 CRAIG
		    I'll tell you all about it when I
		    get home.

	Craig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands
	Elijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly
	watches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow.
	Something is going on in his brain. We move slowly into
	his eyes.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

	It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed
	out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa."
	The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We
	watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari
	suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The
	chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie
	them up. The safari men laugh.

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Well, there monkeys ain't going
		    nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
		    brews 'fore the boss comes back...

	The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend
	from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One
	of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.

				 CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Son, untie your mother and me!
		    Quickly! Before the great bald
		    chimp-men return.

	A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and
	struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two
	speaks.

				 CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Hurry, Elijah!

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Why you little bastard!

	Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.

	Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the
	ropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He
	works furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her
	mouth.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!

	Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks
	the cage, and dials the phone.

				 LOTTE
		    Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me
		    in John the last three times. Craig's
		    had me locked up in the apartment. He
		    made me call you at gunpoint. It's
		    been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
			    (beat, calmly)
		    Really? Well, you know, he's quite
		    good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
		    a session with Malkovich I have to
		    attend. I'll speak with you soon.

				 LOTTE
		    But Maxine, I thought it was me you
		    loved.

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    I thought so too, doll. I guess we

	Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.

	The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands

		    Come on in.

				 MAXINE
		    I can explain about the portal,
		    darling.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
		    just let you up here to tell you
		    that, and to tell you that I'm taking
		    you and Schwartz to court.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh shut up.
			    (beat)
		    Craig, darling are you in there?

	Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward,
	puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be
	against him will.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes. How did you know it was me?

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte called me.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Oh, so the bitch escaped.

				 MAXINE
		    Apparently you can control this
		    Malkovich fellow now.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm getting better all the time.

				 MAXINE
		    I'll say you are. Let's do it on his
		    kitchen table, then make him eat an
		    omelette off of it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich)
		    No... damn... you...
			    (as Craig)
		    Oh shut up, you overrated sack of

				 LOTTE
		    Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
		    Lester.

				 LESTER
		    Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
		    inform you that I find that highly
		    arousing.

				 LOTTE
		    No, you don't understand. I've been
		    inside Malkovich when I'm with
		    Maxine...

				 LESTER
			    (slaps Lotte furiously)
		    What?! That is not allowed. My God,
		    you are supposed to be one of us.
		    You know you must never partake of
		    Malkovich by yourself!

				 LOTTE
		    No, I didn't know that.

				 LESTER
		    Oh, didn't anyone show you the

	TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH

	A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black
	and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.

				 LESTER ON FILM
		    Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.
		    As you may already know, today a
		    baby was born into this sad world.

	We see a shot of a newborn.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    His name is John Horatio Hannibal
		    Malkovich. And we are the keepers
		    of the door to his soul. One day,
		    when his brain is big enough, we
		    will all journey into his head and
		    live there for all eternity. Following
		    the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
		    we will build the ultimate communist
		    community, one body and hundreds,
		    maybe thousands, of brains inside
		    working together to form a super
		    human intellect capable of curing
		    disease, stopping all war, and
		    ruling the world with a benevolent
		    fist. We will take a wife, a woman
		    of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
		    is, as yet, still an infant herself.

	We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
	her hair.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
		    DeMent.

				 LOTTE
		    Does Floris know that she's the
		    chosen?

				 LESTER
		    Well, I tried to explain it to her,
		    but...

	Lester points to his ear and shrugs.

	Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
	relaxed.

				 MAXINE
		    You still there, sweets?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
		    on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
		    it's all in the wrists.

				 MAXINE
		    Wow.
			    (little girl pout)
		    Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

				 MALKOVICH
		    You mean with Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    I'd love to see your work.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (pleased)
		    Really? Yeah. Okay.

	Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    I'll do something I call "Craig's
		    Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

	Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
	did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
	complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
	He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

				 MAXINE
			    (moved)
		    That was incredible. You're brilliant!

				 MALKOVICH
		    You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
		    with dolls.

				 MAXINE
		    You're right, my darling, it's
		    so much more. It's playing with
		    people!

	Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

				 MAXINE
		    Stay in him forever?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, screaming)
		    No!
			    (as Craig, calmly)
		    But how will we make a living,
		    my love, if our clientele doesn't
		    have access to our product?

				 MAXINE
		    Well, we'll have all the money in
		    Malkovich's bank account, plus he
		    still gets acting work occasionally.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, breaking through)
		    No! Please!
			    (as Craig, to Malkovich)
		    Shut up, will you? We're trying to
		    think here.
			    (to Maxine)
		    It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
		    I like that about it.

				 MAXINE
		    No one would ever have to know its
		    not him.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (an idea)
		    Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
		    What if we presented Malkovich as the
		    world's most complicated puppet and
		    me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
		    enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor
		    with the Great Mantini!

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

	The worshippers are assembled. Lotte stands before them.

				 LOTTE
		    I have sinned, unwittingly, against
		    the community. And for this I am
		    truly sorry.

				 MAN #2
		    W-w-what's it like on the inside?

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.

				 MAN #2
		    Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say
		    it's time.

				 LESTER
		    Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're
		    all prepared, and perhaps this
		    Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand
		    a bit. We will enter the portal
		    tonight!

	Everyone cheers.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal
	with cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the
	office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops
	just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (Craig to Malkovich)
		    Shut up!
			    (to Maxine)
		    Sorry, dear, I lost control for
		    a minute.

				 MAXINE
			    (kissing him)
		    It's okay, my sweet.

	They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
	of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
	open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
	in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

				 LESTER
		    Aaaahhhh, the portal!

				 LOTTE
			    (to Malkovich)
		    You bastard!

	Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds
	her back.

				 LESTER
		    No! Don't harm the vessel!

				 LOTTE
		    It's Craig in there, I can tell.

				 LESTER
		    I understand, but we must protect
		    the vessel at all costs.
			    (to Malkovich)
		    Please, Craig, please step aside
		    and allow us to have what is
		    rightfully ours.

				 CRAIG
		    Squatter's rights, Lester.

	Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
	through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
	triumphantly over at Lotte.

				 MAXINE
		    Now excuse us, we have an
		    entertainment legend to create.

				 LESTER
			    (to the cult members)
		    Clear the way for them, my friends.
		    They will be dealt with in due time.

	The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine
	exit.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Now, let's see what we can do to
		    salvage this portal... for the sake
		    of all that is good.

	The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
	begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
	Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and
	skin on the rough gray surface.

	A slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone.

				 AGENT
		    Of course, send him right in. Don't

	Malkovich and Maxine enter. The agent stands, holds out
	his hand.

				 AGENT (CONT'D)
		    John! Great to see you! Sorry about
		    the cunt at reception.

				 MALKOVICH
		    This is my fiancee Maxine.

	The agent shakes Maxine's hand.

				 AGENT
		    Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about

	Malkovich and Maxine sit.

		    Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

				 MAXINE
		    No thanks.

				 AGENT

		    Teresa, get me a chicken soup.
			    (to Malkovich and Maxine)
		    Chicken soup?

	Maxine and Malkovich shake their heads "no."

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'll get right to the point, Larry.
		    I'm a puppet now...

				 AGENT
		    Okay.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm being controlled by the world's

				 AGENT
			    (no clue)
		    Oh yeah, he's good.

	The cult members are still there, now with picks

	excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2
	emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.

				 MAN #2
		    That's the last of it, boss.

	Lester peers through the door.

		    Well, let's see what we've got

	Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind

	Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a

	The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.
	There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester
	views the scene through somebody's POV.

		    My God, where am I? This seems so

	The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!
		    Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!

				 DIRECTOR
		    Cut!

	We look over to see a director and camera crew.

		    Oh, I'm just the actor in that
		    Twilight Zone episode.

	There is a popping sound.

									CUT TO:

	Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is
	waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly
	shakes his head "no."

									CUT TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY

	The cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.
	Lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at
	the ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.

				 LESTER
		    Thank you all for your efforts,
		    but I'm afraid we can no longer get
		    into Malkovich through the portal.

				 LOTTE
			    (panicky)
		    Why not? I need to get in there!

				 LESTER
		    I'm not certain, my dear, but I
		    believe your husband has somehow
		    psychically diverted the route.

				 LOTTE
		    That bastard! I'll gladly dispose
		    of him in the name of the order, Son
		    of Malkovich.

				 LESTER
		    I'm afraid that no physical harm
		    must come to him as long as he
		    inhabits the vessel.

				 MAN #3
			    (raises hand)
		    Oooh, I got an idea! What if we
		    build another portal to Malkovich,
		    like around back, and sneak in that
		    way?

				 MAN #4
		    Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
		    a portal, dummy, and he's dead!

				 LESTER
		    Actually, my friends, I suppose its
		    time I told you, I'm Captain James
		    Mertin.

	The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes
	some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
	a board. He then rearranges them for a while.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    You see, Lester is an anagram for
		    Mertin.

	Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little
	tense now.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    It used to work, I'm sure of it.

	Several members check their watches.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

	L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
	from the board to face the congregation.

				 MAN #3
		    How can this be? I thought you were
		    only one hundred and five years old.
		    Mertin would have to be...

				 LESTER
			    (chuckles amiably)
		    I'm two hundred and five, truth be
		    told.

				 WOMAN #1
			    (flirtatiously)
		    You don't look a day over one
		    hundred and five, Captain. What's
		    your secret?

				 LESTER
		    Lots of carrot juice, little lady.
		    That, and a deal with the Devil.

	There is a lot of murmuring in the room now.

				 MAN #2
		    So what exactly are you saying? Are
		    we in cahoots with the Dark Master
		    here?

				 LESTER
		    Surprise.

	The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
		    into Malkovich, we still get to rule
		    the world, just like I told you. The 
		    only difference is that we rule in the
		    name of evil, instead of good.

	People stop in their tracks.

				 MAN #3
		    That's the only difference?

				 LESTER
		    Absolutely.

	The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    So anyway...

	Lotte stands.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, I for one, am resigning. I will
		    not serve evil. I am ashamed of all
		    of you.

	Lotte heads for the door.

				 LESTER
		    My dear, let me assure you that when
		    we attain power, it will be much more
		    pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
		    than for those outside.

	Lotte stops and turns.

				 LOTTE
		    I'll take my chances.

	She exits.

				 LESTER
		    Anybody else?

				 WOMAN #1
		    Do we get to wear a crown?

				 LESTER
		    But of course.

				 WOMAN #1
		    Count me in.

				 LESTER
		    Good. I think its time to beckon
		    Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us
		    out of this pickle.

									FLIP TO:

	Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and
	blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch
	him.

				 FLEMMER
		    Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,
		    I didn't anticipate this.

				 LESTER
		    And as I said, sir, we can't very
		    well exert physical persuasion upon
		    the sacred vessel Malkovich.

				 FLEMMER
		    Right, Lester. I heard you the first
		    time. I'm not a dummy.

				 LESTER
		    Didn't mean to imply that you were,
		    sir.

				 FLEMMER
		    Look, I'm going back to my house
		    to ponder this. So stay calm and
		    keep track of Schwartz's comings
		    and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose

		    Nice to meet you all.

	Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly
	sobbing. The caged animals watch her.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're
		    not human. People are treacherous
		    and greedy and corrupt. I've lost
		    my heart to two of them and I almost
		    lost my soul to another. And I'm no
		    better. Look at the way I keep you,
		    locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.
		    Well, I've been in a cage too, my
		    friends. Literally and figuratively.
		    So tonight I set you free.

	Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks
	all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their
	cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until
	she is alone.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Good-bye, friends.

	A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still

	Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.
	The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.

	Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.
	Then he leads her by the hand out the window.

		    onto that stage a nobody and
		    presto-change-o, you're coming
		    back the greatest puppeteer the
		    world has ever seen.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting
		    me hard today.

	Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.

				 MAXINE

	INT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT

	The house is filling with formally dressed audience members.
	The cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among
	them. The lights go down.

				 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		    Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
		    great privilege of the Luxor hotel
		    and Casino to present Craig Schwartz
		    and his magical puppet John
		    Malkovich.

	The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.

				 LESTER
		    Blasphemous bastard.

	Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly
	nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
			    (grudgingly)
		    Pretty good though.

	Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
	knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today
	Goodbye."  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
	with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
	with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
	appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
	him.

				 USHER
		    Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting
		    you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid
		    there's not an empty seat in the
		    entire house.

				 MANTINI
			    (not taking his eyes from the stage)
		    Make one empty.

				 USHER
		    Y-y-y-es sir.

	The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
	Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
	performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The
	Waterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

				 LESTER
		    Not too shabby.

	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
	juggling chainsaws.

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

	At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich
	a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the
	cultists get up.

									CUT TO:

	INT. SEWER - NIGHT

	Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up
	against the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of
	her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying
	supplies:  food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket
	and sits down next to her.

				 LOTTE
		    They're going to take over the
		    world, Elijah. Evil will reign.
		    But, then, evil already reigns,
		    doesn't it? So what difference
		    does it make if John Malkovich
		    is wearing the fucking crown while
		    it's reigning?

	Elijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is
	returning.

									CUT TO:

	INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	It's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment.
	Looks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls
	are lined with books. Mr. Flemmer sits at his desk, his
	head in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.

				 FLEMMER
		    It's open.

	The door opens and Lester pokes his head in.

				 LESTER
		    It's just me, boss. I brought
		    croissants.

	Lester enters with a greasy white paper bag.

				 FLEMMER
		    Have a seat. I wracking my brain
		    over this Malkovich thing.

				 LESTER
		    We saw his show at the Luxor last
		    night.

				 FLEMMER
			    (impressed)
		    Vegas? What'd you think?

				 LESTER
		    The kid's got talent. You've never
		    seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz
		    had him up there singing and dancing.
		    Impressions.

				 FLEMMER
		    Impressions? Those are hard.

				 LESTER
		    Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad
		    we can't kill him.

				 FLEMMER
		    I suppose I could come to him in a
		    dream. I don't know. That's the best
		    I can think of right now.

				 LESTER
		    A scary dream?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
		    dream.

				 LESTER
			    (noncommittally)
		    I like that.

									CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	Malkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is
	surrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking
	champagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing
	table, brushing her hair.

				 MALKOVICH
		    They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz
		    is fantastic!"  The New York Times.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.
		    We're going to ride this straight to

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sleepy suddenly.

				 MAXINE
		    Busy day, my little fire chief. Why

	But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of
	his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts 
	blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HELL - NIGHT

	Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of
	flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.
	He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away
	from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking
	the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister
	grin.

				 CRAIG
		    Who are you?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh.

				 FLEMMER
		    Leave Malkovich. He is mine.

		    Bad dream, darling?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I've got to leave Malkovich.

				 MAXINE
		    You've got to be kidding.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I just had the most horrifying
		    nightmare. The devil was in it.

	Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased
	with himself.

				 MAXINE
		    Malkovich is our meal ticket. You
		    can't back out because of some
		    stupid dream.

				 FLEMMER
			    (to himself)
		    Shit.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Honey, we can be happy and poor
		    together.

				 MAXINE
			    (laughs derisively)
		    Perhaps you'll want to consult that
		    Ouija board again.

	There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.

				 MAXINE (CONT'D)
		    Yeah what?!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Derek Mantini!

	Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and
	Maxine give each other the once over.

				 MANTINI
			    (still eyeing Maxine)
		    Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Did you see the reviews?

				 MANTINI
		    Yeah, I saw them

				 MALKOVICH
		    Because if you missed any, I just
		    happen to have copies here you can
		    take with you when you leave now.

				 MAXINE
		    I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
		    with Malkovich.

				 MANTINI
		    Very impressive. I could use a
		    producer with your vision. And
		    other outstanding attributes.

				 MALKOVICH
		    She's not available.

				 MANTINI
		    We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MAXINE
		    Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MANTINI
		    I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
		    more importantly, mine. Here's my
		    proposal: There's only room in this
		    world for one "World's Greatest
		    Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow
		    the puppet-going public to crown
		    their king.

				 MALKOVICH
		    How do we do that?

				 MANTINI
		    A friendly competition, if you will.
		    Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
		    Truman puppet appear opposite each
		    other in a play. Not some Vegas
		    Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
		    that requires actual acting. The
		    audience decides who is more deserving
		    of the title. The losing puppeteer
		    bows out graciously. Goes back to
		    obscurity as a file clerk.

				 MALKOVICH
		    What's the play?

				 MANTINI
		    Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Never heard of it.

				 MANTINI
		    Broadway's finest three hours. It's
		    about the suppression of the
		    individual. Conformity as God in
		    modern society.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing but acting to hide behind,
		    buddy-boy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
		    with the National Puppet Company's
		    production of "Long Day's Journey
		    Into Night."

				 MANTINI
		    Great then.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Is there dancing?

				 MANTINI
		    No.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Who needs dancing?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, for God's sake, I just watered

		    saw him do "Tru" with his sixty
		    foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

				 FLEMMER
		    But I think I have another plan.

				 LESTER
			    (snippy)
		    Do tell. I love a good plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Why are you being like this?

	Lester shrugs.

				 LESTER
		    I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me
		    the plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
		    leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
		    needs it, I help Mantini's performance
		    a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
		    show.

				 LESTER
		    Can you do that? I mean, do you know
		    anything about puppetry?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
		    handle it.

				 LESTER
		    I was just asking. No disrespect
		    intended.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. Let's drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. I mean, it's not like I was
		    doubting you, it's just that I know
		    puppetry is a skill that takes a long
		    time to acquire.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen
		    table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a
		    letter from Alex Trebek.

	Lotte and Elijah, now dirty and drawn, are talking. Elijah
	uses sign language.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    You've got to tell Craig what's going
		    on. He must never leave Malkovich.

				 LOTTE
		    I'm glad you learned sign language,
		    Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging.
		    I'm tired of this conversation. I'm
		    tired period. What has the world ever
		    done for me that I should feel
		    personally responsible for saving it?

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    It is better to light one candle than
		    curse the darkness. I learned that

	EXT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT

	The Marquee reads: Derek Mantini's sixty-foot Harry S.
	Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John
	Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's "Equus."

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT

	The house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood
	planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and
	stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S.
	Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the
	flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman
	and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Do you dream often?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Do you?

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    It's my job to ask the questions.
		    Yours to answer them.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Says who?

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Says me. Do you dream often?

				 MALKOVICH

	We see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing.

	INT. BROADHURST BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	The dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the
	wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as
	a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the
	actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine.

	INT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER

	It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves
	through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation.
	Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple:

				 THEATERGOER #1
		    That Truman puppet is downright
		    boring as the psychiatrist.

				 THEATERGOER #2
		    It's a wooden performance, really.
		    Get it? Wooden?

	Second couple:

				 THEATERGOER #3
		    What's with the Malkovich puppet?
		    He was much better in Vegas when he
		    played the piano with his feet.

				 THEATERGOER #4
		    I hate it when they try to stretch.
		    It's like Woody Allen.

	Third couple:

				 THEATERGOER #5
		    They both stink! I'm going across the
		    street to second act Miss Saigon.

									CUT TO:

	INT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	Malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror.
	Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights
	up a cigarette.

				 MAXINE
		    You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics,
		    lover, 'cause right now you're running
		    neck and neck with the dead president.
		    And you're both in last place.

	Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his
	head.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles
	Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    You're doing beautifully, my boy. I
		    wept at the speech about your wife.

	Flemmer materializes behind Mantini

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    What the hell? Nyong-nyong!

	Mantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break
	for it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in
	mid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he,
	too, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls
	for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his
	pocket.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT

	We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace
	as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to
	be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his
	movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's
	as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    I can hear the creature's voice. It's
		    calling me out of the black cave of
		    the Psyche. I shove in my dim little
		    torch, and there he stands -- waiting
		    for me. He raises his matted head. He
		    opens his great, square teeth and says
			    (mocking)
		    'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --
		    ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really
		    imagine you can account for Me?
		    Totally, infallibly, inevitably
		    account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'

	Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this
	bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and
	sees a silent, rapt crowd.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - A BIT LATER

	Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm.
	During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to
	upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising
	his ten foot eyebrows in surprise...

				 MALKOVICH
		    Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed!
		    Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming!
		    ... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS

	A man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the
	street. She is dirty but determined.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL

	Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic
	convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the
	bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking
	it. Truman speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...
		    Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!
		    Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...
		    Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...
		    In. Out .. In ... Out ...

	Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the
	focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the
	crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.

				 AUDIENCE MEMBER
			    (to his wife)
		    That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine
		    actor.

				 FLEMMER
			    (blood boiling)
		    Bastard is stealing my thunder.

	Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,
	swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he
	talks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    All right! I'll take it away! He'll be
		    delivered from madness. What then?
		    He'll feel himself acceptable! What
		    then?

	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman
	out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on
	the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all
	fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.
	Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when
	he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll
		    erase the welts cut into his body by
		    flying manes.

	The audience "ooohs" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his
	clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from "Swan
	Lake." The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,
	now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and
	flying around the auditorium as he speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses
		    will be quite safe. You'll save your
		    pennies every week, till you can
		    change that scooter into a car...

	The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,
	in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes
	into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "Mr.
	Bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant
	swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns
	to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.
	Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just
	raised from the dead.

				 ACTUAL TRUMAN
		    Where am I? Aren't I dead?
			    (possessed)
		    Vote for Mantini!

	Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant
	puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a
	standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the
	catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him.
	Thunderous applause is heard in the background.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Good-bye, Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    Whatever.

	Malkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (weak but relieved)
		    I'm back! My nightmare is over.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

	Flemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a

		    Okay, now!

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds
	the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and
	the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal,
	while shrieking a war cry.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.
	Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then
	by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with
	each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting
	out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich
	is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war
	cry and runs out onto the stage.

									CUT TO:

	INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.
	Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the
	audience.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (now sounding like fifty voices)
		    I am your earthly king! Kneel before
		    me!

	The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to
	their knees.

				 CROWD
			    (like automatons)
		    Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.

	Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in
	the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.

	Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath
	figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the
	theater.

	Maxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for
	the exit.

	FADE IN

	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

	CHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK

	Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but
	everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets,
	the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,
	carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody
	talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.
	There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
	theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
	movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
	about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
	jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
	and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his
	lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the
	street looks up.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (fifty voices)
		    Greetings, my lowly subjects.

				 FLORIS
		    Great things, my lonely subtext?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (rolls his eyes)
		    Boy, be careful what you wish for.
			    (to Floris)
		    Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
		    will you?

	Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
			    (to the people on the street)
		    I am bored. You will dance for your
		    king now.

	Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
	into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
	silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
	that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
	void of expression. Malkovich laughs.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    Faster! Faster, my little trained
		    monkeys!

	The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
	exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
	help, nobody dares.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
	tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
	in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:

	A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT

	This place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards,
	cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
	totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
	position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
	animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
	and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
	gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Must you take this terrible demon
		    on yourself, my love?

				 LOTTE
		    Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
		    Malkovich and destroy him from the
		    inside. If not me, who?

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    If there was any way I could go in
		    your place. But I'm only a monkey
		    and...

				 LOTTE
			    (puts finger to his lips)
		    Hush, sweetheart.

	Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
	on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
	embrace.

				 LOTTE
			    (to the animals)
		    I'll be with you always, my friends.
		    Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
		    rejoin you with wings and a beak.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
		    and a halo.

	Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
	into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.

				 PARROT
			    (softly)
		    Good-bye. Good-bye.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY

	A man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
	is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
	the others, and enters the building.

									CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
	the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
	She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
	door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
	and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS

	Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
	is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
	turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

				 LOTTE
		    My God!

				 CRAIG
		    I'm so glad you're safe. You look
		    really wonderful.

				 LOTTE
		    I'm in love. For the first time.
		    It's funny, but when it happens to
		    you, there's no question.

				 CRAIG
		    He's a lucky man.
			    (beat)
		    Do I know him?

				 LOTTE
		    It's Elijah.

				 CRAIG
		    The iguana?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
		    I'm sure he's a better lover than I
		    ever was.

				 LOTTE
		    A better friend.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    I'm sorry for everything.

				 LOTTE
			    (pecking him on the cheek)
		    It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
		    in an odd sort of way.

				 CRAIG
		    You came up here looking for the
		    portal?

				 LOTTE
		    Yeah. I was going to kill him from
		    the inside.

				 CRAIG
		    And yourself too in the process. God,
		    you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
		    see that before?

				 LOTTE
		    You saw it once. Now you see it again.
		    That's life, isn't it? And you were
		    up here to try the same thing, weren't
		    you?

				 CRAIG
		    I suppose. But they got here first,
		    the lousy bastards. So now it's all
		    over, I guess.

				 LOTTE
		    I don't know. There's a small
		    community of us. We have a place they
		    don't know about. We're happy. We'll
		    keep trying to figure out a way. Come
		    stay with us. Join the struggle.

				 CRAIG
		    You'll have me, after all I've done
		    to you?

				 LOTTE
		    People make mistakes.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
		    I just want you to know that.

				 LOTTE
		    I know.

				 CRAIG
		    I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
		    help things grow, to encourage life.
		    Do you and your friends need a farmer?

				 LOTTE
		    Sure. We could really use a farmer.
		    We'd be grateful for the help.
			    (beat)
		    Also, I think, you know, if you
		    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
		    puppet show every once in a while,
		    would do a lot to lift our spirits.
		    You know, if you wouldn't mind too
		    terribly.

	Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

	She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
	elevator.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you, Lotte.

	We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
	it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
	We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
	Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.

				 MANTINI
			    (in Craig's voice)
		    I can't wait to see where you and your
		    friends live, Lotte.

				 LOTTE (O.S.)
		    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

	Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
	follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

				 FLEMMER
		    One serpent, coming up.

	Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
	into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
	looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
	tunnel.

	MUSIC IN: "Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head" by They

Next!

DARIN
Go ahead.

MAN
Yo next!

DARIN
Go ahead!

MAN
Yo next!  Woah!  Read this sign.  You must be at least this big to ride 
this ride!

CYNTHIA
What?

MAN
Hey, I don't make the rules here.  Next!  Next!

CYNTHIA
Well, it's a stupid rule.

MAN
Look, why don't you try the kiddy ride?

sleep?  ...Honey?  I put out some clean clothes.  Bring down your 
dungarees and stuff for the laundry, okay?

JOSH
Okay.

MOM
Are you getting a cold, Josh?

JOSH
No!  Fine!

He's got a cold.  Then Rachel's gonna get a cold and I'm gonna get a 
cold...

Oh my God.

You want orange juice or...What about your breakfast?!

SCENE 10

MOM
Oh, you...don't!  Don't!

JOSH
I'm sorry! ...Mom, it's me.  It's Josh.  Mom, I'm a grown up!

MOM
Stop it!  Oh God!
JOSH
I made a wish last night...I turned into a grown up, Mom!  I made this 
wish on a machine...

MOM
Go away!  Go away!  Please!

JOSH
...and it turned me into a grown up!  It was last night at the 
carnival!  My birthday is November 3rd...I got a B on my history test!

MOM
Here's my purse!  You can have anything that's in it!  Go away!

JOSH
My, my, my baseball team is called the Dukes!  Uh, I made this for you!   
Who are you calling?  Ah!  I have a birthmark behind my left knee!

MOM
You bastard!  What did you do to my son?

JOSH
I am your son, Mom!

MOM
Where is my child?!  Where is my son?!  Police!

SCENE 11

COACH
Heads up!  Heads up out there!

BILLY
I'm open!  Here!  I'm open!

COACH
I want you to gather up these balls, go to the locker room and get on 
to your next class!  Wash shirts and shorts!  Billy.  Do us both a 
favor.  Put the balls in the equipment closet and you practice your lay 
up.

SCENE 12

JOSH
Billy.

BILLY
Yeah?  What?

JOSH
It's me.  It's Josh!

BILLY
Coach Burns!  Coach Burns!  Coach Burns!

JOSH
Wait a minute!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I'm your best friend, you've gotta 
believe me!  I'll prove it to you!  Billy, please!

BILLY
Help!  Help!

JOSH
God damn it Billy Kopecky!  Look, I know that I don't look like myself, 
okay!  But something really strange happened and I'm really scared and 
I need your help!  You're my best friend!  I can prove it to you!  
...Ooh!  The spades go, Down!  Down! Baby!  Down!  Down the roller 
coaster!  Sweet, sweet baby!  Sweet, sweet delectable!  Shimmy, shimmy

mother's credit!  I'm cool!  I'm hot!  Sock me in the stomach three 
more times!

BILLY
Josh?  You look terrible.

JOSH
I know.
SCENE 13

POLICE
That's right.  We're at the scene right now.  Well, she's pretty upset 
and she's not making any sense at all.  There's no ransom note, no 
prints, there's no nothin.'  Tell you what, file a report and to be on 
the safe side...

KID#1
I bet he ran away.  Wish I could.

KID#2
Want me to pack your bags?

SCENE 14

BILLY
We go to the city, we lay low for a couple of days, find that Zoltar 
Machine, make your wish...you'll be home by Thursday!

JOSH
Well, I'm not supposed to go to New York without my folks!

BILLY
C'mon!  You'll be fine!  ...Here.

JOSH
Where did you get this?!

BILLY
From my Dad's top drawer!

JOSH
You stole it?!

BILLY
It's his emergency fund!

JOSH
Jesus Billy!

BILLY
Well what do you call this?!

SCENE 15

WOMAN
You lookin' for some fun tonight sweet thing?

JOSH
No, thank you.

MAN
Hey man, can you spare some change?

JOSH
No, not really.

BILLY
Hey, this looks okay.

JOSH
No it doesn't.

BILLY
Saint James, Josh, it's religious.

SCENE 16

BILLY
Hi.

JOSH
Hi.

MAN
Burp!

JOSH
Uh, we would like a hotel room, please.

MAN
$17.50 a night for the room, $10.00 deposit for the sheets....You go 
straight to the top of the stairs.  It's the last door on the right.  
Next to the bathroom.  Wait a second, I'll show you.

SCENE 17

BILLY
It smells bad.

JOSH
Shh!

MAN
Have a pleasant stay....Hey Angel!  Get out of that bathroom now!

JOSH
I don't want to stay here by myself.

BILLY
I can't help it Josh.  I've gotta be home by ten.  Look, I'll cut 
classes tomorrow and we'll find that Zoltar thing before you know it, 
okay?  It's just one night.  All right?

JOSH
All right.

BILLY
Good.

JOSH
What if I can't sleep?

BILLY
It's probably better if you don't.  See you in the morning.

JOSH
Well, you mean like what time?

BILLY
8:30.  I'd use the chain if I were you.

JOSH
Mom...Mom....

SCENE 18

JOSH
I told you, it's not a video game.

BILLY
Well, what is it?

JOSH
Well, it's not a video game.

BILLY
This one's got a number on it.  Does yours?

JOSH
No.  Oh wait, here's one.

MAN
Hey, what are doing?  What are doing?

JOSH
Do you have Zoltar?

MAN
No.  I told you, I looked back in the back.  I've got Powerhouse, I've 
got ...

JOSH
We really need Zoltar.

MAN
Well, I haven't got it.

SCENE 19

BILLY
This is it.

JOSH
They aren't going to have it.

BILLY
They'll have it.

MAN
Can I help you?

JOSH
Yes.  We would like a list of all carnivals and fairs.

BILLY
And arcades.

JOSH
Yeah.

MAN
Carnivals and fairs...Try Consumer Affairs, down the hall, room 111.

JOSH
Thank you.

SCENE 20

WOMAN
Fill this out in triplicate.  $5.00 filing charge.

BILLY
See.

WOMAN
One month to process.  You get in six weeks.

JOSH
Six weeks?

WOMAN
Sometimes longer, but, you could get lucky....Next please!

SCENE 21

JOSH
I'm gonna be thirty years old for the rest of my life.

BILLY
Would you come on.  We'll figure something out.  By the way, you may be 
older than that!

JOSH
So now what?

BILLY
I'll come and see you everyday after school.

JOSH
How?

BILLY
I'll tell them I made the basketball team.

JOSH
I won't have anything to do.

BILLY
You can get a job.

JOSH
I can't get a job.

BILLY
Why?  It can't be any different than school.  What are you good at?

JOSH
I don't know.  Making spit balls?

SCENE 22

BILLY
How about a delivery man?

JOSH
I don't know how drive.
BILLY
Oh yeah, right...Cardiological technician, civil engineer...

JOSH
You gonna eat your cherry?

BILLY
Go ahead....Clerical transcriber...

JOSH
Billy?

BILLY
Yeah....Gross.  God, that's gross!

JOSH
Hey, go on to the next column.

BILLY
Collection agent, company clerk, computer operator, construction 
engineer...

JOSH
Computer operator?  Computer operator, read that one.

BILLY
Josh, would you quit with your stupid computers!

JOSH
Just read it!

BILLY
Macmillan Toys...toys!

JOSH
Toys!

SCENE 23

WOMAN
Macmillan Toys, may I help you?

BILLY
Okay, what's next?  There.

JOSH
Previous employment.

BILLY
Your paper route.

JOSH
I can't put that.

BILLY
Paper route circulation?

JOSH
Yeah!

BILLY
What's he got?  Hey, don't worry about it.

JOSH
Social Security number?

BILLY
32-17-25.

JOSH
What is that?

BILLY
My locker combination.

JOSH
Great!

WOMAN
Mr. Baskin.  Mr. Baskin?

JOSH
Yes.  Yes.

WOMAN
The Personnel Director will see you now....Uh, you son can wait out 
here.

JOSH
Yeah, okay.  Son, you should sit down and don't give the lady any 
trouble now.

BILLY
Sure Dad!  ...Don't forget--look him in the eye!

SCENE 24

MAN
Couple of numbers missing on your Social Security.

JOSH
Oh, uh twelve.

MAN
One two.  Says here you've got four years experience.

JOSH
Yes.

MAN
All on computers?

JOSH
Yes.

MAN
Where did you go to school?

JOSH
It was called George Washington.

MAN
Oh, G.W.  My brother-in-law got his doctorate there.  Did you pledge?

JOSH
Yes.  Every morning.

SUSAN
It happened again!  David, the girl is absolutely useless!  You've got 
to get me someone who knows what she is doing!  Excuse me.  I'm not 
getting any of my mail, nothing has been filed!  Ever since she got 
engaged, my life has been a disaster!  

MAN
You know, she came so highly recommended.

SUSAN
She spent the last three months writing down her married name.  Mrs. 
Judy Hicks.  Mrs. Donald Hicks.  Mrs. Judy Mitchleson Hicks.  Sometimes 
with a hyphen, sometimes without a hyphen.  Sometimes she spells the 
hyphen!

MAN
Well, I really don't know where I can put her.

SUSAN
Put her on unemployment!

MAN
When can you start?

JOSH
Soon.

SCENE 25

MAN
I thought we'd start you out with preschoolers.  Should take you a few 
days.  Give you a chance to find your way around.  Do you smoke?

JOSH
Well, uh, just once, but...

MAN
Only on breaks in the coffee room....Most of that is pretty straight 
forward stuff.  If you have any questions, come to me.  Good luck.

JOSH
Bye!

SCENE 26

SCOTT
Psst!  Psst!  Hey!  Hey!  I'm Scott Brennan.

JOSH
Uh, I'm Josh Baskin.

SCOTT
Listen, what are you trying to do?  Get us all fired?

JOSH
Huh?

SCOTT
You've gotta slow down.  Pace yourself.  Slowly!  Slowly!

JOSH
Sorry.  Today's my first day.

SCOTT
I know!

JOSH
So how long have you worked here?

SCOTT
Five years.  Work stinks but the fringe benefits are great!  See that 
girl over there in the red?  Say hi to her and she'll be yours.  She'll 
wrap her legs around you so tight you'll be begging for mercy!

JOSH
Well, I'll stay away from her then!

SCOTT
Excuse me.  Yeah Brennan.  I gave it to you yesterday!  Oh, here it is.  
I don't have time to xerox it.  Let the new guy do it.

SCENE 27

MR. M
That's total bullshit Paul!

PAUL
Look sir, the favorability rate is...

MR. M
Come on!  Let's not lie to ourselves!  If a kid likes a toy it sells.  
That's all!

SUSAN
But every bit of research and focus testing...

MR. M
It works with research, it works with focus testing, it just doesn't 
work with the kids!

JOSH
Sorry!  I'm sorry!

PAUL
Why don't you watch where the hell you're going!

SUSAN
Are you okay!

MR. M
I'm fine.

PAUL
You could kill somebody running around here like that!

MR. M
It's all right Paul.  The boss should get knocked on his ass once in a 
while.  It's good for him.

PAUL
I don't know sir, maybe you should see a doctor.

MR. M
For crying out loud Paul, I'm fine!  I'm fine!

PAUL
Sorry sir!  Sorry!
MR. M
Where were you going anyway, son?

JOSH
Uh, I was going to the xerox room because they needed these by 5:00.

MR. M
Oh, that's good!  Nothing wrong with a little hustle.  Nothing at all!  
Right Paul?

PAUL
What does he mean?  I hustle!  Uh sir!  Sir!

SCENE 28

MOM
Hello?  ...Hello?

JOSH
Hello.  Mrs. Baskin?

MOM
Yes.

JOSH
How are you?

MOM
Who is this?

JOSH
I just wanted you to know that Josh is all right.  He's okay.

MOM
You have my boy?

JOSH
Yeah.  And you're gonna get him back, just the way he was.

MOM
Look, I swear to God--If you do anything to him, if you touch one hair 
on his head, I will spend the rest of my life making sure you suffer!

JOSH
Wow!  Thanks!

MOM
Let me talk to Josh!

JOSH
Oh, he can't come to the phone right now.

MOM
Why not?  Why not?  What did you do to him?!

JOSH
I didn't do anything to him!  I think he's a terrific kid!

MOM
I want proof that he's all right!

JOSH
Uh, well, all right.  Ask me something that only he would know.  Then 
I'll ask him for you and that way you'll know that he's okay.

MOM
Ask him what I used to sing to him when he was a little boy.

JOSH
Isn't there something else that you would rather ask him?

MOM
Ask him!

JOSH
Oh, I got it!  I got it!  Memories, like the corner of my mind.  Misty 
water color memories, of the way we were.  Scattered pictures...Look, 
you're gonna see him again really soon.  I promise.  I cross my heart.  
We'll talk about this later.

SCENE 29

MAN
Harris!  Brennan!  Baskin!
JOSH
What is this?

SCOTT
Pay day.

JOSH
$187.00?!  Ha!  Ha!

SCOTT
Yeah.  They really screw you, don't they?

SCENE 30

JOSH
Hi.

WOMAN
Hi.  Okay, so how would you like that?

JOSH
Three dimes, a hundred dollar bill, and eighty seven ones.

WOMAN
One, two, three...

SCENE 31

JOSH
I'm never eating again.

BILLY
It wasn't that bad.

JOSH
It was the boat ride that did it.

BILLY
No, it was the pork rinds.

JOSH
Pork rinds!  Aghh!  We sure had fun, didn't we?

BILLY
Yeah, we sure did.

SCENE 32

BOY
Got you!

JOSH
What's your name?

BOY
Jordan, what's yours?

JOSH
Mine's Josh.

BOY
I'm gonna blow you away Josh!

JOSH
But I just got you!

BOY
No way!  Get back here!

SCENE 33

MR. M
You work for me, don't you?

JOSH
Yes.

MR. M
I thought so.  What, are you here with your kids?

JOSH
No.  I was just looking around.

MR. M
Oh.  Me too.  I come here every Saturday.  Can't see this on a 
marketing report.

JOSH
What's a marketing report?

MR. M
Exactly.  Come on.  What do you think of that?

JOSH
The Championship Hockey?  Oh, I love it.  Only the...

MR. M
Only what?

JOSH
Well, the pieces don't move.

MR. M
What do you mean?

JOSH
Well, on the old set you could slide the men up and down the ice, and 
now all they do is spin around.  It was more like real hockey the old 
way.  Why did they change it?

MR. M
I don't know.

JOSH
You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the 
pieces.  But I never liked the Galactakons.  You only get one robot, 
and they don't come with a vehicle.  

MR. M
I see.

JOSH
Plus you can't take them underwater.  And if you do they...Neat!

MR. M
Okay, let's check out the...Piano lessons?

JOSH
Three years.

MR. M
Me too.  Everyday, after school....Chopsticks....What department did 
you say you were in?

JOSH
Oh, I'm in computers.

MR. M
Computers?  You just saved me a trip to the gym Son.

SCENE 34

SUSAN
Vice President in charge of Product Development.

PAUL
Vice President!  He's only been here a week!  Vice President?!

SUSAN
And he came from data processing!

PAUL
He's out of his mind!  The old man has finally lost it!

SUSAN
Did you know they gave him Bob's old office?

PAUL
Bob's office?!  Bob's office is bigger than my office!  There's got to 
be a reason.  Things like this don't happen unless there's a reason.

SCENE 35

BILLY
That means if the president dies you get to take over?

JOSH
No. No.  They got a hundred of them.  Are we ready?

WOMAN
Yes Mr. Baskin.

JOSH
Come on in.

BILLY
Look at this place!  It's bigger than the principal's office!

JOSH
How would you know?

BILLY
Remember that explosion in science?

JOSH
Oh yes!

BILLY
Truck-a-Killer!  $59.95?

JOSH
You know that only costs 10 bucks to make.

BILLY
Get out of here! ...What is this?

JOSH
Oh, well, this is just...They just put this in here...it doesn't mean 
anything.

BILLY
So what do they make you do for all this?

JOSH
Well, I play with all of this stuff and then, I go in there and tell 
them what I think.

BILLY
That's it?

JOSH
Yeah.

BILLY
And they pay you for that?

JOSH
Yeah.

BILLY
Suckers!

JOSH
Oh, thank you Miss Patterson.  Hey!  Miss Patterson.  Could you call 
down to Media and have them send up a video tape of the Giants Broncos 
Super Bowl?  And have them edit out all the commercials and talkin' and 
stuff?

WOMAN
Yes Mr. Baskin.

JOSH
Miss Patterson.

BILLY
You're the luckiest guy I know.

SCENE 36

PAUL
Did you check Mattel?

SUSAN
Nothing.

PAUL
Colleco?

SUSAN
Zero.

PAUL
He can't come from nowhere Susan.  He has to come from somewhere.  How 
about Hasbro?

SUSAN
Yes.  And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.  I have called everywhere.  
Nobody's ever heard of him!

PAUL
Great!

SUSAN
Face it Paul.  The guy comes from data processing.

PAUL
Terrific.  That is just terrific!  This is just terrific!

SUSAN
You're being paranoid Paul.

SCENE 37

PAUL
These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind 
format of eight over-lapping demographic groups.  Every region of the 
country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to 
11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds.  
When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent 
market share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we 
should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total 
revenue from all of last year.  Any questions?  Yes?  Yes?

JOSH
I don't get it.

PAUL
What exactly don't you get?

JOSH
It turns from a building into a robot, right?

PAUL
Precisely.

JOSH
Well, what's fun about that?

PAUL
Well, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our 
success in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 
percent in the last two years.  There, that might help.

JOSH
Oh.

PAUL
Yes?

JOSH
I still don't get it.

PAUL
What?!

MR. M
What don't you get Josh?

JOSH
Well, there's a million robots that turn into something.  And this is a 
building that turns into a robot.  So what's so fun about playing with 
a building?  That's not any fun!

PAUL
This is a skyscraper.

JOSH
Well, couldn't it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug 
or something?

PAUL
A bug?
JOSH
Yeah!  Like a big prehistoric insect with maybe like giant claws that 
could pick up a car and crush it like that!

MAN
A prehistoric transformer?

MR. M
Interesting.

PAUL
Gentlemen!

MAN
So the robot turns into a bug.

PAUL
Ah, gentlemen, listen...

MAN
Listen to him.  He's got a very good idea here.  The robot turns into a 
bug.

MAN
This is a great idea!

JOSH
Different sizes and things.  And...you could have them wreck 
something...

MAN
A lady bug.  Transformers for girls!

MR. M
This is a bug that moves....It's got all kinds of possibilities.

PAUL
This doesn't just happen.  This doesn't happen.  You don't just come to 
a meeting and say "bugs."

SUSAN
I, uh....

MR. M
Well done, Josh.  Well done.

SCENE 38

PAUL
Ho! Ho! Ho!  He is vicious!  

SUSAN
He's not vicious.

PAUL
Oh, come on Susan, don't kid yourself.  That man is a killer!

SUSAN
All he said was "I don't get it."

PAUL
I don't get it!  I don't get!  I don't get!  He's going for the throat, 
trying to eviscerate me!  Did you see the look on Macmillan's face?!

SUSAN
Mmm Hmm.

SCENE 39

REALTOR
It's quite a unique space.  The lines are so clean and you don't get 
any of that partition quality.  It has 50-foot ceilings, all hardwood 
floors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a brand new bathroom with 
a jet stream jacuzzi.

BILLY
We'll take it.

SCENE 40

MAN
Baskin.  Rental delivery!

JOSH
Dear Mom and Dad.  They said that I could write you and let you know I 
was okay.  So far, they're treating me fine.  I've got enough to eat 
and I'm perfectly safe.  They say that I'll get out of here in about a 
month.  In the mean time, it's a lot like camp!  I watch TV and even 
get outside once in a while.  I know you miss me.  But try not to 
worry.  I think this experience might even be good for me.  I love you 
very much and I know that I'll see you soon.  Your son, Joshua.  P.S.  
Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother.

SCENE 41

WOMAN
It's very beautiful and I'm having a lovely time.

MR. M
I'm glad Miss Patterson.

WOMAN
It's much better than last year.  I just wanted to tell you that.

MR. M
I'll have another scotch....Susan.

SUSAN
Love your tux.

MR. M
I think it's the same as the maitre's.

SUSAN
Have you decided what you're doing on the Danberry line?

MR. M
No, I haven't.

SUSAN
Well, uh, I think if you got everyone's input up front, I mean right 
from the beginning....

MR. M
Susan, have a drink.

SUSAN
What?

MR. M
Have a couple drinks.  It's a party.

SCENE 42

MR. M
Josh!  Glad you could make it.

MAN
Bet he gets another raise.

MR. M
Now that's what I call a tuxedo.

JOSH
I rented it.  This is a real bow tie though.  I tied it myself.  And 
that's why I was late.

MR. M
No, you're not late at all.  Come on, let me show you around.

JOSH
Hey, there's Miss Patterson!  Hi!  There's the guy from the meeting!  
Hi!

SCENE 43

PAUL
The guy's a damn knock-off artist.

MAN
What do you mean?

PAUL
The Amphibian?  He takes 10,000 G. I. Joes, slaps some gills on them, 
webs their feet, and packages them in seaweed....So I show him the 
schedule and he says, "It's not correct accounting procedure!"  Give me 
a goddamn break!

MAN
But the toy sold Paul.

SUSAN
Excuse me.

SCENE 44

SUSAN
Hi.

JOSH
Hi.

SUSAN
All the same people having all the same discussion.  It's like they 
cloned some party in 1983 and kept spinning it out again and again and 
again.  I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll line.  

JOSH
Thanks.

SUSAN
They were so, incisive.  It's Beluga.  Macmillan orders it every 
year....You all right?  You okay?  You want a glass of water?  You want 
something to drink?

JOSH
Could I have a milkshake or something?

SUSAN
I've got a car outside.  You want to get out of here?

JOSH
Uh Huh.

SUSAN
Let's go.

SCENE 45

SUSAN
I'm not really a big one for parties.  You know, I like things that are 
a little more intimate.  

JOSH
Wow!  Is this your car?

SUSAN
Well, it's the company's car.

JOSH
Oh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen!

SUSAN
I mean, just seeing someone in the office, you don't really get a 
chance to know them.  I mean, just being with you here tonight, I 
really get a sense of who you are.

JOSH
Are you gonna eat these fries?

SUSAN
No. No....

JOSH
Hey mister?  You want some of these fries?  We're not going to eat 
them.

DRIVER
No, thank you.

SUSAN
You see, it's hard in a business situation...I mean there's this 
invisible line and even you're attracted to someone...What, are you 
going to call someone before...?

JOSH
No.

SUSAN
Uh, I mean at this point in my life I...Don't...Don't play with the 
radio...Leave the uh...Don't...I'm really vulnerable right now!  You 
know...I mean, I love my job and I....

JOSH
Ejector seat!  This is great!  Hey!  Come on up!  Hey, that was my 
apartment.

SUSAN
Really?  I'd love to see where you live.

SCENE 46

SUSAN
So have you always lived alone?

JOSH
No, not always.

SUSAN
Ah.  Is it just recently or...?

JOSH
Yeah.

SUSAN
Give yourself a couple of days, it'll pass.

JOSH
Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks.

SUSAN
Well, it can be painful but, that's what they invented Xanax for, 
right?

JOSH
Watch your step.

SUSAN
I'm not sure we should do this yet.

JOSH
Do what?

SUSAN
Well, I mean I like you and I want to spend the night with you....

JOSH
Do you mean sleep over?

SUSAN
Well,...yeah!

JOSH
Okay!  But I get to be on top!

SCENE 47

SUSAN
You live here?

JOSH
Yeah.  It's nice, isn't it?

SUSAN
Yeah.

JOSH
You uh, want a soda?

SUSAN
Huh?

JOSH
Soda?  You want one?

SUSAN
Yeah, sure.

JOSH
They rigged this up so you don't need any quarters....Don't!  Don't...!

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
The glue's not dry.  Sorry.

SUSAN
Sorry.

JOSH
It's okay....You wanna play pinball?

SUSAN
No.

JOSH
You don't need quarters for this either.  It's free.

SUSAN
No, thank you.

JOSH
Okay.

SUSAN
Is that a trampoline?

JOSH
Yeah.  You wanna try it?

SUSAN
No.

JOSH
You should.  It's really fun.  It's simple, too.  Come on!  Come on!  
You'll like it and it's really easy to do.

SUSAN
No, I don't think...

JOSH
I'm serious...

SUSAN
Do have some wine?

JOSH
Take off your shoes...It's really easy....Let me get rid of these 
balls.

SUSAN
No, I'm...I'm...I'll watch.

JOSH
Come on.  It's fun.  I'll do it with you.  Up you go.  Excellent.

SUSAN
Help me up?

JOSH
Sure.

SUSAN
Okay.

JOSH
Okay.  Jump.  

SUSAN
You want me to jump?

JOSH
Yes.

SUSAN
There.  Now can we have a drink?

JOSH
No!  No!  No!  I mean really jump.  Now get some air between you and 
the trampoline.

SUSAN
There.

JOSH
Oh, come on!  I'll do it with you!  All right?  I'll show you how to do 
it.  You ready?  Come on.  Jump.  See?  There it is.  That's all there 
is to it.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah!  It's easy!  Anybody 
could do this!

SCENE 48

JOSH
Here.  Pick one....It's for you.  It's a glow in the dark compass 
ring...so you won't get lost....Goodnight.

SCENE 49

PAUL
Did you have fun last night?

SUSAN
Sure.  Yeah.

PAUL
Yeah...You left pretty quick.

SUSAN
I gave him a ride home Paul.

PAUL
Oh, did he enjoy it?

SUSAN
Don't be ridiculous.

PAUL
Ah, that's me, Mr. Ridiculous.  Just a silly old guy.

SUSAN
I don't feel like going out tonight.

PAUL
What do you mean?  They're your friends....Come on!  Leave it!  Leave 
it!  Would you quit it!  Do you have to play with everything?

SCENE 50

PAUL
Baskin?  Baskin!

JOSH
Wouldn't you rather play basketball?  I know how to play that.  We 
could be like a team for the Macmillan Company.

PAUL
No.

JOSH
I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give it a try.  My best sport is 
video hockey.

PAUL
That isn't a sport.

JOSH
Well, it takes eye to hand coordination.

PAUL
It's not a sport if you don't sweat!

JOSH
What about golf?  You don't sweat and that's a sport.

PAUL
Yeah, and you're not sittin' there letting some machine do all the 
work!

JOSH
What about car racing?

PAUL
Aw shut up Baskin!

JOSH
What are the rules again?

PAUL
I told you.  Over the line to serve.  Yellow is out of bounds.  Play to 
21--ready?

JOSH
Sorry.  Sorry.

PAUL
One nothing.  Come on!  Get it!  Get it!  Get it!

JOSH
Okay.

PAUL
Thatta boy!  Okay, you ready?  All right....Ho ho!  Nice try!  That was 
in!  Two zip.  Just made it.  Two zip.  Ready?  Okay!  Here we 
go!...19/18.

JOSH
Uh, that was under the line.

PAUL
What?

JOSH
That was under the line.  You said it had to be over the line on a 
serve.

PAUL
No I didn't.

JOSH
Yeah you did!  You said it had to be over the line on a serve!

PAUL
No I did not, now give me the goddamn ball!

JOSH
Well that's cheating!

PAUL
Give me the goddamn ball, will ya!

JOSH
No!

PAUL
Give me the ball you little shit!  

JOSH
It's my serve.

PAUL
Give me the ball!  Give me the goddamn ball!  I never said that!

JOSH
Yes you did.

PAUL
Give me the...Give me the ball!  Give me the ball!

JOSH
Cheater!  You cheat!

PAUL
I did not cheat!

JOSH
You cheat!  You cheat!

PAUL
Give me the ball!  Give me the ball!  Give me it!  Give me the ball!

SCENE 51

JOSH
He didn't have to punch me.

SUSAN
I know.  He's scared of you.  You don't play his game.

JOSH
I tried to play his game.  He beat me up.  If he's scared of me then 
why did he punch me?

SUSAN
He punched you because he's scared of you.

JOSH
I don't get it.

SUSAN
It's just the way he is.  Everything is a fight with him.  Everyone's 
an enemy.  It's not just a job for him, it's a war.  

JOSH
Well how come you're so nice?

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
Well, you work just as hard as he does and you're not like that.

SUSAN
You don't...you don't know me that well.

JOSH
Yes I do.  You're one of the nicest people I've met.

SUSAN
How do you do it?

SCENE 52

PAUL
What's this?

SUSAN
What does it look like?!  Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and 
your exercise tape!  Oh, and I want my keys back!

PAUL
Sure.  It's just some scratches.  He'll get over it.

SUSAN
Oh, it has nothing to do with him.

PAUL
Oh come on Susan!  He's just another link in the chain!  First it was 
Tom Caulfield, then Handlen.  Then Golding, then me!  Am I missing 
somebody?

SUSAN
It's not like that anymore!

PAUL
What is so special about Baskin?

SUSAN
He's a grown up!

PAUL
Susan.

SUSAN
I can't believe you brought up Golding.

SCENE 53

BILLY
And many more!  What are you going to wish for this time?

SCENE 54

BILLY
I know what we can do!  We can go out and get some beers, some dirty 
magazines and go back...

JOSH
Uh, I can't Billy.

BILLY
What you mean you can't?  Of course you can!  It's your birthday!

JOSH
No, I can't...I have to go somewhere.

BILLY
Where?

JOSH
Um...well, I have to go meet somebody and...

BILLY
So, you got all night!

JOSH
Yeah I know, but it's just...well I can't right now okay, but I'll call 
you, all right?  Okay?  I'll give you a call.  Thanks again Billy, it 
was fun!

SCENE 55

SUSAN
Hi....Do you want to come in?

JOSH
Sure.

SUSAN
Sit down....Want to go?

JOSH
Yeah!  Yeah!

SCENE 56

JOSH
Want to go again?!

SCENE 57

JOSH
So they have these cars that you can actually drive them except they're 
on this rail so you can't get off the road...You have a really big gob 
of mustard right, right...

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
Mustard right....

SUSAN
Where?

JOSH
Right there.

SUSAN
Is it gone?

JOSH
Well,....

SUSAN
Is that...gone?

JOSH
Yeah.

SUSAN
Listen.

JOSH
What?  Music?

SUSAN
Wanna dance?

JOSH
Dance?

SUSAN
Well we don't have to if you don't want to.

JOSH
Okay.  Okay.

SUSAN
All right.
JOSH
Okay....Are you cold?

SUSAN
Mm Mm.

JOSH
We could get some hot chocolate....You can wear my jacket if you want.

SCENE 58

SUSAN
Oh, I haven't done this in a long time....What were you like when you 
were younger?

JOSH
Oh, I wasn't much different.

SUSAN
I believe that about you....I've been thinking about you a lot....It's 
crazy....In my car, lying in bed....I've just never gone out with 
someone like you....With all the other men there was so much to 
hide....I feel like I can tell you anything.

JOSH
Susan?  There's something I think I should tell you.

SUSAN
What?

SCENE 59

SUSAN
You want the light on?

SCENE 60

JOSH
Hey Frank, how are you?  Good morning everybody!

WOMAN
Good morning Sir.

JOSH
I'd like some coffee please Miss Patterson.

WOMAN
But you don't drink coffee.

JOSH
And uh, make it black.

SCENE 61

WOMAN
You know, you two should come to Vermont.  It is so pretty up there.

MAN
Did anyone happen to see that great documentary about Columbus on PBS 
the other night?  

WOMAN
Uh, no.  Was it good?

MAN
I had no idea he had a fourth ship.

JOSH
Yeah, the Santa Christina.

MAN
That's right.

JOSH
He only had that on his second trip, though.

MAN
You saw it, too.

JOSH
No, but I used to study...stuff.

MAN
Really?

BOY
Dad, I need some help.

MAN
All right, but not now Adam.

BOY
Yeah, but Dad you said...

MAN
Adam we have guests.

WOMAN
He's had the roughest time with algebra.  We've tried tutors, 
everything.

JOSH
Algebra?  I used to study that, too.

SCENE 62

JOSH
All right, let's say Larry Bird is going to score 10 points in the 
first quarter.

BOY
Okay?

JOSH
How many is he going to score in the whole game?

BOY
That's easy, that's 40 points.

JOSH
Probably.  Okay.  And that's algebra.

BOY
Right!  It is?

JOSH
Yeah!  See.  Okay.  One quarter is to ten points that he scores in that 
quarter.  Just as four....

WOMAN
You're right.  He's wonderful!

SUSAN
I know.

SCENE 63

BILLY
Department of Consumer Affairs?  Yeah Buddy it came!

SCENE 64

MAN
He's never done this before.

MAN
Kind of like a sweepstakes.

PAUL
Get the Art Department on the phone.  Get them!

SUSAN
Send out for some sandwiches.

MR. M
Maybe next year, all right?  Next year.

SCENE 65

SUSAN
You can do it.  I know you can!

JOSH
I cannot plan a whole line!

SUSAN
Why?  Nobody knows more about toys in the entire company!
JOSH
Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy and stuff like that!

SUSAN
All he wants is a proposal!

JOSH
I can't!

SUSAN
Look, you come up with the ideas and I'll handle the marketing.

JOSH
But it's....

SUSAN
Come on.  It'll be neat.

JOSH
All right...I don't know...I don't have any new ideas for toys or 
anything.

SUSAN
You've got great ideas!

SCENE 66

BILLY
Yeah, well tell him I called again.  Kopecky!  K-O-P...Yeah 
right...well tell him it's important!

SCENE 67

JOSH
You see it won't be like these where you just follow the story along.  
You would actually make a whole different story appear just by pressing 
these buttons.

SUSAN
An electronic comic book?  That's amazing!

JOSH
Yeah.  An electric comic book.  It's gonna be different every time.

SUSAN
This is incredible.  You're brilliant--you know that?

JOSH
If you like one you could see it, you know, over and over and over 
again.

SUSAN
You're wonderful.

JOSH
You really like it?...You think Mac will like it?  You know, what we 
could do...We could do like sports comics...or like if you're going to 
steal second or something like that...You'd have sports 
books...baseball, football...really, it work with almost any sport 
there is.  Hockey!

SUSAN
What...What is it we're doing?  ...What's going on here?  

JOSH
You know, we're....Is something wrong?  You don't like it?

SUSAN
No!  No!  It's...I mean if it's an affair, that's one thing.  But if 
it's something else...I mean, not that we have to know right now, we 
don't...but if we think that it could turn into something 
else...well....How do you feel about all of this?

JOSH
How do I feel about what?

SUSAN
How do you feel about me?

JOSH
What is that supposed to mean?

SCENE 68

JOSH
Well, Wednesday would be better than Thursday...

WOMAN
Mr. Baskin can't be disturbed!

JOSH
Yeah, I have the Keating example right here...

BILLY
Where've you been?  I've been trying to reach you forever!

JOSH
Shh!  I'm right in the middle of something okay?

BILLY
That's the list.  All you've got to do is call!

JOSH
Can you give me just a minute, please?

BILLY
What are you talking about?  This is the list!

JOSH
Would you come back at lunch?  All right, I'm a little bit busy right 
now...Hello?

BILLY
Busy?!

JOSH
Billy!

BILLY
Are you out of your mind?!  

JOSH
Jesus, Billy!  Miss Patterson, could you get them on the phone 
again....

BILLY
This is the list we've been waiting for!

JOSH
I've got work to do!  Can't you understand that?  I've got a deadline 
to meet.  God!

BILLY
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

JOSH
Hey!

BILLY
Hey, you're Josh Baskin!  Remember?  You broke your arm on my roof!  
You hid in my basement when Robert Diceman was about to rip your head 
off!

JOSH
You don't get it, do you?  This is important!

BILLY
I'm your best friend.  What's more important than that, huh?  I'm three 
months older than you are--asshole!

SCENE 69

JOSH
You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard.  All around you are 
the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs....Melt wizard....What do you want to 
melt him with?  ...Throw thermal pod.

SUSAN
Josh, what's wrong?  What is it?

JOSH
I haven't told you something because if I did, I didn't think you'd 
believe me.  And even if you did believe me, I didn't think you were 
going to like me anymore, so....

SUSAN
Oh, Honey, come here.  You can tell me anything.  What?

JOSH
Susan, I'm not what you think I am.
SUSAN
What do you mean?

JOSH
Before I met you I was in little league.  I was in little league and I 
rode my bike to school and I played with my friends and hung out with 
them and....

SUSAN
Josh.  Josh.  What are you talking about?

JOSH
I want to go home.  I miss my family Susan and I want to go home.

SUSAN
Oh my God!  You're married!

JOSH
No!  No!

SUSAN
I knew that this was too good to be true!  I knew that there had to be 
something!

JOSH
No.  No.  Susan, I'm not married.

SUSAN
You're not?

JOSH
No.  I'm a child!

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
I'm a child Susan, and I'm not ready for all this.

SUSAN
Oh that's fine.  That is just great!

JOSH
Well, you see what happened....

SUSAN
No.  I understand.  I'm not ready to make a commitment!

JOSH
No!  No!  No!

SUSAN
I'm not ready to accept responsibility!

JOSH
No!  You don't understand!  I mean, I'm thirteen years old!

SUSAN
Oh!  And who isn't?  You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside 
of me, too!

JOSH
No!  I mean I really am thirteen!  I went to bed one night and I was a 
kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up.

SUSAN
Oh right!  And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails!  Why 
are you doing this Josh?

JOSH
There was this carnival in New Jersey.  I made a wish on this machine.  
It was called a Zoltar Machine...

SUSAN
Oh stop it!

JOSH
It was called a Zoltar Machine!  It had this bobbing head that looked 
just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you 
could make a wish and I did!  So I made a wish to be big!  That is what 
I'm trying to tell you!  I changed into a grown up but I'm really just 
a kid!

SUSAN
Fine Josh!  You're a kid!  Look, I really don't know what it is that 
you're trying to tell me.  But we have a very big presentation to give 
tomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep.

SCENE 70

BILLY
Josh?  Josh!  Oh, hi Mrs. Baskin.

MOM
Hi.  I was just looking around and...Your hair is getting longer.

BILLY
I got it cut yesterday.

MOM
He had a birthday.

BILLY
Yeah, I know.  He'll be coming back real soon.  Everything is going to 
be okay.

MOM
Thanks.

BILLY
Goodnight.

SCENE 71

BILLY
Right there.  Sea Point Park, New York!  Well?

JOSH
Yes?

WOMAN
They're waiting for you Mr. Baskin.

JOSH
Thanks.

BILLY
See you around.

SCENE 72

JOSH
There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it.  
And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what 
the character's going to do...Like if he going to go in and fight the 
dragon then you have to push one of the buttons.

PAUL
Excuse me.

JOSH
Paul.

PAUL
I don't get it.

JOSH
Well, it's a comic book that....

SUSAN
See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when 
you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes.  That's 
the point.

MR. M
Terrific Susan.

SUSAN
A kid makes his own decision.

MR. M
This is really possible?

SUSAN
Yeah.  In fact, it's a very simple program.  Isn't that right?
MAN
So what happens when you run out of choices?

SUSAN
Well, that's the great thing.  You can just sell different adventures.  
Just pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options.

MAN
We could market this on a comic book rack.

JOSH
I'll be right back.

SCENE 73

MR. M
How much would the unit cost?

SUSAN
Well, our initial figure is around...around $7.00, with a retail cost 
of around $18.95.

PAUL
You expect a kid to pay $19.00 for a comic book?

SUSAN
I think a kid....Would you excuse me?

SCENE 74

SUSAN
Josh!  Josh!

SCENE 75

JOSH
Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York?

BILLY
Sea Point Park?  Josh!....Josh!  Josh!...Yes!

SCENE 76

SUSAN
Excuse me.  You know him?  You know Josh?

BILLY
Yeah.

SUSAN
Look, you have to tell me where he went.

BILLY
Who are you?

SUSAN
I'm his girlfriend.

BILLY
Billy Kopecky.

SUSAN
Look, you have to tell me where he went.  Where did he go?  Please, 
tell me.  Tell me!

SCENE 77

JOSH
Work!  Damn it!....I wish I was a kid.

SUSAN
Josh!

JOSH
Susan!

SUSAN
You know, you don't walk out on somebody!  You don't just get up and 
leave and walk out like that!  You don't do that!

JOSH
I know.  I know.  I'm really sorry.  I'm really sorry but I didn't know 
what to do.  I didn't know what to say.

SUSAN
Oh God.  You got your wish.

JOSH
I tried to tell you.

SUSAN
I didn't listen, I guess.  I didn't hear you...

JOSH
I tried to tell you last night.

SUSAN
...or want to...or how would I have...or even if I did listen, why 
would I know?  Why would I know that?!

JOSH
I've been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to 
go home but there is only one reason for me to stay.

SUSAN
What?  What reason is that?

JOSH
Well, you...Oh, come on.  Don't cry.

SUSAN
So, what are you?  15?  16?

JOSH
I'm 13.

SUSAN
Well, that explains it.

JOSH
Maybe you could come with me.

SUSAN
No.  No.

JOSH
Why not?

SUSAN
I've been there before.  It's hard enough the first time.  You know 
what I mean?  You don't know what I mean....Come on, I'll drive you 
home.

JOSH
I'm sorry.

SUSAN
No, I'll be okay.  You'll be fine.  In ten years, who knows?  Maybe you 
should hold on to my number.

SCENE 78

SUSAN
So this is where you live.  Which one is it?

JOSH
The one right there.

SUSAN
Oh.  It's nice.  I'm gonna miss you.

JOSH
I'm gonna miss you, too.

SUSAN
You won't even remember me.

JOSH
Oh yes I will.

SCENE 79

JOSH
Mom?  Hello!
MOM
Josh?  Josh!  Josh!  Oh my God!  Oh, thank God you're home!

JOSH
Oh Ma, I missed you all so much!

SCENE 80

JOSH
I'm just not good enough.

BILLY
What are you talking about?  You've been hitting the ball over the 
fence almost every time in stick ball.  You just got to get used to a 
fatter bat.

JOSH
You really think I could do it?

BILLY
Yeah!

JOSH
Come on.  We'll hit some after supper.

BILLY
Okay.  I'll call you.

"BIG FISH"

                                        Written by

                                       John August

                                  Based on the novel by

                                      Daniel Wallace

                                  Final Production Draft

                

               This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but 
               truer for their inclusion. 

               FADE IN:

               A RIVER.

               We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.

               This is The Beast.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There are some fish that cannot be 
                         caught. It's not that they're faster 
                         or stronger than other fish. They're 
                         just touched by something extra. 
                         Call it luck. Call it grace. One 
                         such fish was The Beast.

               The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited 
               with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past 
               a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         By the time I was born, he was already 
                         a legend. He'd taken more hundred-
                         dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. 
                         Some said that fish was the ghost of 
                         Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned 
                         in that river 60 years before. Others 
                         claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, 
                         left over from the Cretaceous period.

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)

               WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD 
               BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, 
               Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with 
               absolute conviction.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't put any stock into such 
                         speculation or superstition. All I 
                         knew was I'd been trying to catch 
                         that fish since I was a boy no bigger 
                         than you.
                              (closer)
                         And on the day you were born, that 
                         was the day I finally caught him.

               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)

               A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES 
               as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I'd tried everything on it: 
                         worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut 
                         butter-and-cheese. But on that day I 
                         had a revelation: if that fish was 
                         the ghost of a thief, the usual bait 
                         wasn't going to work. I would have 
                         to use something he truly desired.

               Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.

                                     LITTLE BRAVE
                              (confused)
                         Your finger?

               Edward slips his ring off.

                                     EDWARD
                         Gold.

               While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks 
               bored. He's heard this story before.

                                     EDWARD
                         I tied my ring to the strongest line 
                         they made -- strong enough to hold 
                         up a bridge, they said, if just for 
                         a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.

               INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)

               Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming 
               dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of 
               Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.

                                     EDWARD (CONT'D)
                         The Beast jumped up and grabbed it 
                         before the ring even hit the water. 
                         And just as fast, he snapped clean 
                         through that line.

               WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His 
               mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and 
               practicality -- stands with him at the door.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can see my predicament. My wedding 
                         ring, the symbol of fidelity to my 
                         wife, soon to be the mother of my 
                         child, was now lost in the gut of an 
                         uncatchable fish.

               ON WILL AND SANDRA

                                     WILL
                              (low but insistent)
                         Make him stop.

               His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.

                                     WILL'S DATE
                         What did you do?

                                     EDWARD
                         I followed that fish up-river and 
                         down-river for three days and three 
                         nights, until I finally had him boxed 
                         in.

               Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.

                                     EDWARD
                         With these two hands, I reached in 
                         and snatched that fish out of the 
                         river. I looked him straight in the 
                         eye. And I made a remarkable 
                         discovery.

               INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)

               WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This 
               is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and 
               family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.

               Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is 
               cozy and drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         This fish, the Beast. The whole time 
                         we were calling it a him, when in 
                         fact it was a her. It was fat with 
                         eggs, and was going to lay them any 
                         day.

               Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from 
               the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier 
               if this were her own wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I was in a situation. I could 
                         gut that fish and get my ring back, 
                         but doing so I would be killing the 
                         smartest catfish in the Ashton River, 
                         soon to be mother of a hundred others.

               Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, 
               but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-
                         born son the chance to catch a fish 
                         like this of his own? This lady fish 
                         and I, well, we had the same destiny.

               As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --

                                     EDWARD AND WILL
                         We were part of the same equation.

               Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Honey, it's still your night.

               Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, you may well ask, since this 
                         lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, 
                         why did it strike so quick on gold 
                         when nothing else would attract it?
                              (closer; he holds up 
                              his ring)
                         That was the lesson I learned that 
                         day, the day my son was born.

               He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has 
               always been -- about her more than anyone.

                                     EDWARD
                         Sometimes, the only way to catch an 
                         uncatchable woman is to offer her a 
                         wedding ring.

               A LAUGH from the crowd.

               Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she 
               crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not 
               lessened their affection for each other.

               As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.

               The crowd APPLAUDS.

               Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for 
               her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

               Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.

               EXT. OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT

               We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. 
               Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more 
               heated. Both men are a little drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         What, a father's not allowed to talk 
                         about his son?

                                     WILL
                              (disbelieving)
                         I am a footnote in that story. I am 
                         the context for your great adventure. 
                         Which never happened! Incidentally! 
                         You were selling novelty products in 
                         Wichita the day I was born.

                                     EDWARD
                              (shaking his head)
                         Jesus Christ.

                                     WILL
                         Friend of yours? Did you help him 
                         out of a bind?

                                     EDWARD
                         Come on, Will. Everyone likes that 
                         story.

                                     WILL
                         No Dad, they don't. I do not like 
                         the story. Not anymore, not after a 
                         thousand times. I know all the 
                         punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as 
                         well as you can.
                              (closer)
                         For one night, one night in your 
                         entire life, the universe does not 
                         revolve around Edward Bloom. It 
                         revolves around me and my wife. How 
                         can you not understand that?

               A long beat, then...

                                     EDWARD
                              (low)
                         Sorry to embarrass you.

               Will won't let him get the last word.

                                     WILL
                         You're embarrassing yourself, Dad. 
                         You just don't see it.

               ANGLE ON Edward. Fine. A hand to wave, enough of you.

               He walks away.

               ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger. It's then 
               we FREEZE FRAME.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         After that night, I didn't speak to 
                         my father again for three years.

               INT. A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY

               A typically busy day. On hold with the phone cradled under 
               an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his 
               desk.

                                     WILL (ON PHONE)
                              (without pauses)
                         William Bloom with the Associated 
                         Press if I could just...

               He's put back on hold. Returning to the mail, he finds a 
               hand-addressed envelope. Rips it open.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         We communicated indirectly I guess. 
                         In her letters and Christmas cards, 
                         my mother would write for both of 
                         them.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a 
               sandwich.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         When I'd call, Mom would say that 
                         Dad was out driving. Or swimming in 
                         the pool.

               Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.

                                     WILL
                         True to form, we never talked about 
                         our not talking.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sandra stands by the window, watching as...

               EXT. BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I didn't see anything 
                         of myself in my father, and I don't 
                         think he saw anything of himself in 
                         me. We were like strangers who knew 
                         each other very well.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         In telling the story of my father's 
                         life, it's impossible to separate 
                         the fact from the fiction, the man 
                         from the myth. The best I can do is 
                         to tell it the way he told me.

               We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught 
               in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something 
               changes.

               Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 
               20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not 
               just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world 
               had conspired to create him.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         It doesn't always make sense, and 
                         most of it never happened.

               Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, 
               grabbing hold of

               THE BEAST.

               He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the 
               eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         But that's what kind of story this 
                         is.

               Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back 
               into the water with a splash.

               TITLE OVER:

                                         BIG FISH

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's 
               flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting 
               bedside manner...

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to 
                         give me one good push. On three. 
                         One...

               Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets 
               into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold 
               tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up 
               into air.

               The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one 
               can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we 
               can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.

               As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides 
               it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races 
               after it.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Bursting through the doors --

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Grab that baby!

               A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby. Everyone lets 
               out a collective sigh of relief.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         My father's birth would set the pace 
                         for his unlikely life. No longer 
                         than most men's, but larger. And as 
                         strange as his stories got, the 
                         endings were always the most 
                         surprising of all.

               INT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY

               Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the 
               tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has 
               that insistent European sound.

               As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly 
               empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in 
               its carton.

               KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings 
               open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of 
               groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife 
               Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Allo oui?

               Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer 
               unleashing a new drizzle. He plays it up, trying to get a 
               reaction out of Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (on phone)
                         Yes, he's here.

               She hands the phone to Will, concerned.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's your mother.

               Half-stripped, Will takes the phone. This won't be good news.

                                     WILL
                              (on phone)
                         Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

               As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, 
               very pregnant. She listens carefully to Will's side of the 
               conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.

                                     WILL (CONT'D)
                         What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No, 
                         sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait.

               He covers the mouthpiece. Looks over to Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's bad.

                                     WILL
                         It's more than they thought. They're 
                         going to stop chemo.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You need to go.

                                     WILL
                         Probably tonight.

               A beat.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm going with you.

                                     WILL
                         You don't have to.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (a simple fact)
                         I'm going with you.

               INT. AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT

               As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the 
               welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach. 
               Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.

               Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him. There's an 
               effortless intimacy between them. She can pinpoint what he's 
               feeling before he can.

               INT. 747 / FLYING - NIGHT

               Hours later, and the lights are dimmed. Most of the PASSENGERS 
               are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against 
               Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.

               Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then 
               he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.

               Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands 
               to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good, 
               making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a 
               dog.

               We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.

                                     EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)
                         So which one's it gonna be? The Monkey 
                         in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?

               Focusing on the final shadow, we...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT

               ...come to find Edward making the shapes.

               Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The 
               endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big 
               shadows on the wall.

                                     WILL
                         The one about the witch.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mom says I can't tell you that 
                         one anymore. You get nightmares.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not scared.

               Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in 
               earshot. He then leans in, complicitous.

                                     EDWARD
                         Neither was I. At first.

               Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.

                                     EDWARD
                         This all happened in the swamp outside 
                         of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to 
                         go out in the swamp, on account of 
                         the snakes and spiders and quicksand 
                         that would swallow you up before you 
                         could even scream. But there were 
                         five of us out there that night: Me, 
                         Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price 
                         Brothers, Don and Zacky.

               Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.

                                     EDWARD
                         Not a one of us knew what was in 
                         store.

               As his hand moves past the light, we

                                                                   COME TO:

               A flashlight SWEEPS past. We are...

               EXT. FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT

               The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive. The moon hangs 
               low, casting long shadows.

               Five kids walk past in silhouette. Four have flashlights on. 
               The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).

                                     EDWARD
                         Zacky, turn your flashlight on!

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't got any batteries!

               Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10. His brother DON PRICE is 12, 
               and a lot bigger than the others. 

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then why'd you bring it?

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't want to be in the swamp with 
                         a witch and no flashlight.

               WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a 
               sharecropper. Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to 
               be there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Is it true she got a glass eye?

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I heard she got it from Gypsies.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's a Gypsy?

                                     ZACKY
                         Your momma's a Gypsy.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Your momma's a bitch.

                                     RUTHIE
                         You shouldn't swear. There's ladies 
                         present.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Shit.

                                     ZACKY
                         Damn.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         Screw.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         Turn off your flashlights! She'll 
                         see 'em.

               MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates 
               of...

               EXT. A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Now, it's common knowledge that most 
                         towns of a certain size have a witch, 
                         if only to eat misbehaving children 
                         and the occasional puppy who wanders 
                         into her yard. Witches use those 
                         bones to cast spells and curses that 
                         make the land infertile.

               We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically 
               creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie 
               gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to 
               fly over it.

               In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows 
               what is lurking in the shadows?

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, 
                         there was one who was the most feared. 
                         For she had one glass eye, which was 
                         said to contain mystical powers.

               We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I hear if you look right at it, you 
                         can see how you're gonna die.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's 
                         not even a real witch.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You're so sure, why don't you go in 
                         and get that eye? I heard she keeps 
                         it in a box on her nighttable.

               Edward looks back at the spooky house.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Or are you too scared?

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll go in right now and get that 
                         eye.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I will.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Fine, you do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I'm doing it.

               He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.

                                     RUTHIE
                         Edward, don't!

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         She'll make soap out of you!
                              (to Ruthie)
                         That's what she does, she makes soap 
                         out of people.

               Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, 
               Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.

               Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. 
               They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don 
               holds him by the collar.

               EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE

               Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front 
               door. Anything could jump out of them.

               He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he 
               continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. 
               Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

               The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look 
               like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and 
               closer before he finally

               RINGS THE DOORBELL.

               Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with 
               a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead 
               for years, but too stubborn to lie down.

                                     EDWARD
                              (calm and 
                              straightforward)
                         Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and 
                         there's some folks'd like to see 
                         your eye.

               EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more 
               convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the 
               gate.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You get the eye?

                                     EDWARD
                         I brought it.

                                     DON PRICE
                              (dubious)
                         Let's see it.

               The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping 
               up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left 
               eye, it shines with a hellish glow.

               We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY

               An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing 
               a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. 
               Dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               We RUSH IN on Don Price.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

               Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, 
               face mushed in the grout. Very much dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears 
               in his eyes.

                                     ZACKY
                         I saw how I was gonna die. I was 
                         old, and I fell.

                                     DON PRICE
                         I wasn't old at all.

               The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old 
               Woman, Edward smiles.

               EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT

               Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but 
               curiosity gets the better of him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was thinking about death and all. 
                         About seeing how you're gonna die.

               The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I mean, on one hand, if dying was 
                         all you thought about, it could kind 
                         of screw you up. But it could kind 
                         of help you, couldn't it? Because 
                         you'd know that everything else you 
                         can survive.

               The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.

                                     EDWARD
                         I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.

               The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. 
               And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks 
               into The Eye.

               This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he 
               witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and 
               amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. 
               His future has something strange in store.

                                     EDWARD
                         Huh. That's how I go?

               The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns 
               and leaves.

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I no longer 
                         feared death. And for that, I was as 
                         good as immortal.

               As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY

               The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the 
               porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53), 
               surprised and a little annoyed.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get here?

                                     WILL
                         We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that 
                         big really.

                                     SANDRA
                         Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up 
                         at the airport.

                                     WILL
                         We rented a car.

                                     SANDRA
                              (simply)
                         You didn't need to do that. You just 
                         didn't.

               A beat. Starting over...

                                     WILL
                         Hi, Mom.

               He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son 
               tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- 
               strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm so glad you're here.

               That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
               in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --

                                     SANDRA
                         You shouldn't have flown. But...

               They hug.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's good to see you. You look 
                         beautiful.

               It's not flattery. It's the truth.

                                     SANDRA
                         Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Yes.

                                     SANDRA
                         Down the hall on the right. The door 
                         sticks. You have to really pull it.

               Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. 
               Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra 
               follows him.

               Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the 
               first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for 
               the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are 
               playing on the street.

                                     WILL
                         Is that Dr. Bennett's car?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's up with your father.

               Heading back to the house...

                                     WILL
                         How is he?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's impossible. He won't eat. And 
                         because he won't eat, he gets weaker. 
                         And because he's weaker, he doesn't 
                         want to eat.

                                     WILL
                         How much time does he have left?

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't talk about those things. 
                         Not yet.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.

               DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded 
               from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black 
               physician. He's still the town's best physician.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.
                              (they shake)
                         My wife, Josephine.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         A pleasure.

               He judges her belly.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         You're seven months.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (impressed)
                         To the day.

               He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's a boy.

               She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over -- 
               what did he say? Josephine shakes her head.

               Back to the main subject...

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't think he looks any worse.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         No. I would say he's the same.

               And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't 
               the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.

                                     WILL
                         Can I see him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Absolutely. Be good for you to talk 
                         to him.

               A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't 
               spoken in years.

               Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the 
               counter.

                                     SANDRA
                         Get him to drink one of these. He 
                         won't, but tell him he has to.

               INT. FOYER - DAY

               Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. 
               They CREAK with every step.

               The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most 
               of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant 
               and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can 
               see him growing up with every step.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the 
               end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand 
               along the wallpaper.

               Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. 
               Then goes inside.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not 
               the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. 
               The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.

               There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.

               Coming up to the bed --

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries 
               to say something, but no words come out.

               He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him 
               a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

               Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, 
               tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.

               Finally...

                                     EDWARD
                         You --
                              (he points)
                         -- are in for a surprise.

                                     WILL
                         Am I?

                                     EDWARD
                         Having a kid changes everything. I 
                         mean, there's the diapers and the 
                         burping and the midnight feedings...

                                     WILL
                         Did you do any of that?

                                     EDWARD
                         No, but I hear it's terrible. Then 
                         you spend years trying to corrupt 
                         and mislead this child, fill its 
                         head with nonsense and still it turns 
                         out perfectly fine.

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm up for it?

                                     EDWARD
                         You learned from the best.

               Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers 
               the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.

                                     WILL
                         Just drink half the can. I'll tell 
                         her you drank the whole thing. 
                         Everyone wins.

               A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open 
               the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.

                                     EDWARD
                         People needn't worry so much. It's 
                         not my time yet. This isn't how I 
                         go.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

                                     WILL
                         The Old Lady by the swamp.

                                     EDWARD
                         She was a witch.

                                     WILL
                         No, she was old and probably senile. 
                         Maybe schizophrenic.

                                     EDWARD
                         I saw my death in that eye. And this 
                         is not how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         So how does it happen?

                                     EDWARD
                         Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to 
                         ruin it for you.

               Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, 
               then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.

                                     EDWARD
                         There was this panhandler who used 
                         to stop me every morning when I came 
                         out of this coffee shop near the 
                         office.

                                     WILL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         And every day I gave him a quarter. 
                         Every day. Then I got sick and was 
                         out for a couple of weeks. And when 
                         I went back there, you know what he 
                         said?

                                     WILL
                         What did he say?

                                     EDWARD
                         You owe me three-fifty.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         True story.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         When did you ever work in an office?

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a lot you don't know about 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         You're right.

               Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother was worried we wouldn't 
                         talk again. And look at us. We're 
                         talking fine. We're storytellers, 
                         both of us. I speak mine out, you 
                         write yours down. Same thing.

               Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about 
                         some things while I'm here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You mean, while I'm here.

                                     WILL
                         I'd just like to know the true 
                         versions of things. Events. Stories. 
                         You.

               Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING 
               escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. 
               It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from 
               talking.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother hasn't been keeping up 
                         the pool. If you wanted to you 
                         could...

                                     WILL
                         I will.

                                     EDWARD
                         You know where the chemicals are?

                                     WILL
                         I used to do it when you were gone, 
                         remember? I used to do it a lot.

               He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-
               empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...

                                     EDWARD
                         I was never much for being at home, 
                         Will. It's too confining. And this, 
                         here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is 
                         the worst thing that ever happened 
                         to me.

               He smiles at his joke.

                                     WILL
                         I thought you weren't dying.

                                     EDWARD
                         I said this isn't how I go. The last 
                         part is much more unusual. Trust me 
                         on that.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of 
               the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.

               Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he 
               leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]

               ...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his 
               face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's 
               showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Dr. Bennett says I'm going to have 
                         to be home for a week.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's nothing. I once had to stay 
                         in bed for three years.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Did you have chicken pox?

                                     EDWARD
                         I wish.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TINY CHURCH - DAY

               Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about 
               10 -- sings "Down to the River My Lord" along with the 
               CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it 
               his all.

               Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then 
               another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, 
               wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps 
               SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.

               He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting 
               red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to 
               undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more 
               buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.

               ON HIS SHOES

               As we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's 
               how fast he's growing.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Truth is, no one quite knew what was 
                         wrong. Most times, a person grows up 
                         gradually. I found myself in a hurry.

               INT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various 
               pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen 
               encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         My muscles couldn't keep up with my 
                         bones, and my bones couldn't keep up 
                         with my body's ambition. So I spent 
                         the better part of three years 
                         confined to my bed, with the World 
                         Book Encyclopedia being my only means 
                         of exploration. I had made it all 
                         the way to the "G's," hoping to find 
                         an answer to my gigantificationism, 
                         when I uncovered an article about 
                         the common goldfish.

               INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.

                                     YOUNG EDWARD
                              (reading)
                         "Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish 
                         will remain small. With more space, 
                         the fish can grow double, triple, or 
                         quadruple its size."

               Young Edward thinks this through.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It occurred to me then, that perhaps 
                         the reason for my growth was that I 
                         was intended for larger things. After 
                         all, a giant man can't have an 
                         ordinary-sized life.

               EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

               The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The 
               crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds 
               the bases.

               Although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first 
               real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from 
               roughly the ages of 18 to 30.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As soon as my bones had settled in 
                         their adult configuration, I set 
                         upon my plan to make a bigger place 
                         for myself in Ashton.

               EXT. SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY

               SINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. 
               On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret 
               love:

                                     GIRL
                         Edward Bloom!

               The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over, 
               glowers.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               SINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP 
               to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of 
               his teenage EMPLOYEES.

               Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, "Bloom 
               Landscaping." He has workers on every lawn.

               He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.

               INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

               Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other 
               end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.

               As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only 
               teammate who doesn't mob him.

               EXT. TOWN - DAY

               Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.

               INT. SCIENCE FAIR - DAY

               Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine 
               labelled "Perpetual Motion." He and the JUDGE pose for a 
               photograph. A FLASH.

               Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the 
               trash.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY

               A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain 
               call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don 
               Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.

               Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.

               EXT. GRADUATION STAGE - DAY

               Edward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was the biggest thing Ashton had 
                         ever seen. Until one day, a stranger 
                         arrived.

               EXT. FARM - DAY

               As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a 
               massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly 
               the shape of man, but no human could be that large.

               EXT. SHEEP PEN - DAY

               Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They 
               BLEAT in panic as

               TWO OVERSIZED HANDS

               reach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're 
               carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the 
               full stranger.

               EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY

               A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns. 
               Amid the crowd we see Don Price.

                                     SHARECROPPER
                         He ate an entire cornfield!

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         He ate my dog!

                                     HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER
                         If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor, 
                         we will!

                                     MAYOR
                         I won't have mob violence in this 
                         town. Now, has someone tried talking 
                         to him?

                                     SOME FARMER
                         You can't reason with 'im!

                                     SHEPHARD
                         He's a monster!

               Agreement from the crowd. And then...

                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
                         I'll do it.

               Everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal 
               none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll talk to him. See if I can get 
                         him to move on.

                                     MAYOR
                         Son, that creature could crush you 
                         without trying.

                                     EDWARD
                         Trust me, he'll have to try.

               EXT. HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY

               Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching 
               the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the 
               remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked 
               clean.

               In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:

                                     EDWARD
                         Hello!

               There's no answer.

                                     EDWARD
                         My name is Edward Bloom! I want to 
                         talk to you!

               From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         GO AWAY!

               The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair 
               back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm not going anywhere until you 
                         show yourself.

               A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward 
               braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's 
               going to take.

               As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even 
               Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Armed with the foreknowledge of my 
                         own death, I knew the giant couldn't 
                         kill me. All the same, I preferred 
                         to keep my bones unbroken.

               Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.

               Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams 
               into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

               KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not 
               just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard 
               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains 
               of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living 
               in his matted hair.

               Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his 
               rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice 
               it.

                                     KARL
                         Why are you here?

               Edward ponders the best response, settling on...

                                     EDWARD
                         So you can eat me. The town decided 
                         to send a human sacrifice, and I 
                         volunteered.

               Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.

                                     EDWARD
                         My arms are a little stringy, but 
                         there's some good eating on my legs. 
                         I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them 
                         myself.
                              (beat)
                         So I guess, just, if you could get 
                         it over with quick. Because I'm not 
                         much for pain, really.

               Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. 
               Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.

               After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see 
               what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking 
               his chops --

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I can't go back. I'm a human 
                         sacrifice. If I go back, everyone 
                         will think I'm a coward. And I'd 
                         rather be dinner than a coward.

               Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.

                                     EDWARD
                         Here, start with my hand. It'll be 
                         an appetizer.

               Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But 
               the giant spits it back out.

                                     KARL
                         I don't want to eat you. I don't 
                         want to eat anybody. It's just I get 
                         so hungry. I'm too big.

               And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak -- 
               a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

               Edward takes a seat beside him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you ever think maybe you're not 
                         too big? Maybe this town's just too 
                         small. I mean, look at it.

               Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town 
               in a tiny valley.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hardly two stories in the whole place. 
                         Now I've heard in real cities, they've 
                         got buildings so tall you can't even 
                         see the tops of 'em.

                                     KARL
                         Really?

                                     EDWARD
                         Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got 
                         all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat 
                         a lot, can't you?

                                     KARL
                         I can.

                                     EDWARD
                         So why are you wasting your time in 
                         a small town? You're a big man. You 
                         should be in the big city.

               Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --

                                     KARL
                         You're just trying to get me to leave, 
                         aren't you? That's why they sent you 
                         here.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's your name, Giant?

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do 
                         want you to leave, Karl. But I want 
                         to leave with you.
                              (closer)
                         You think this town is too small for 
                         you, well, it's too small for a man 
                         of my ambition. I can't see staying 
                         here a day longer.

                                     KARL
                         You don't like it?

                                     EDWARD
                         I love every square inch of it. But 
                         I can feel the edges closing in on 
                         me. A man's life can only grow to a 
                         certain size in a place like this.
                              (beat)
                         So what do you say? Join me?

               Karl thinks a moment. Then --

                                     KARL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         Okay.

               They shake on it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now first, we gotta get you ready 
                         for the city.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, 
               while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.

               EXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY

               Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the 
               good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and 
               Karl.

               There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.

                                     MAYOR
                              (loudly, for the crowd)
                         Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, 
                         it's with a heavy heart we see you 
                         go. But take with you this Key to 
                         the City, and know that any time you 
                         want to come back, all our doors are 
                         open to you.

               Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his 
               neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start 
               walking, waving as they go.

               Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward 
               go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he 
               could crush Edward.

               Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or 
               shake his hand.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         That afternoon as I left Ashton, 
                         everyone seemed to have advice.

                                     VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
                         Find yourself a nice girl! Don't 
                         trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your 
                         pride, Edward Bloom!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         But there was one person whose counsel 
                         I held above all others.

               As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with

               THE OLD WOMAN.

               The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been 
               cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper 
               something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear 
               her voice.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         She said that the biggest fish in 
                         the river gets that way by never 
                         being caught.

               The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to the Old Woman)
                         Okay. Thanks.

               Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, 
               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.

                                     KARL
                         What did she say?

                                     EDWARD
                         Beats me.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking 
               out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly 
               possessions.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There were two roads out of Ashton, 
                         a new one which was paved, and an 
                         older one that wasn't. People didn't 
                         use the old road anymore, and it had 
                         developed the reputation of being 
                         haunted.

               Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers 
               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road 
               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Since I had no intention of ever 
                         returning to Ashton, this seemed as 
                         good a time as any to find out what 
                         lay down that old road.

               Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.

                                     KARL
                         You know anyone's who's taken it?

                                     EDWARD
                         That poet, Norther Winslow did. He 
                         was going to Paris, France. He must 
                         have liked it, because no one ever 
                         heard from him again.
                              (beat)
                         Tell you what. You take the other 
                         way and I'll cut through here. Meet 
                         you on the far side.

               A little paranoid...

                                     KARL
                         You're not trying to run away?

                                     EDWARD
                         Just to be sure, you can take my 
                         pack.

               Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.

               EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

               The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is 
               still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

               Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's 
               a day meant for whistling.

               EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH

               The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight 
               break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the 
               air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.

               Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny 
               vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, 
               he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is 
               dead quiet.

               He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It 
               would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.

               He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch 
               on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.

               FURTHER ALONG

               A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING 
               BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at 
               them.

               Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right 
               out of his hands.

                                     EDWARD
                         You stupid sonofa...

               He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The 
               stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm 
               roars out.

               Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]

               Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.

               A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. 
               Reads it:

                                         WARNING!

                                     JUMPING SPIDERS!

               Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with 
               thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There comes a point where a reasonable 
                         man will swallow his pride and admit 
                         he's made a terrible mistake. The 
                         truth is, I was never a reasonable 
                         man.

               Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.

                                     EDWARD
                         And what I recalled of Sunday School 
                         was that the more difficult something 
                         became, the more rewarding it was in 
                         the end.

               EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY

               Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs 
               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in 
               his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he 
               still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.

               At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty 
               and comforting.

               Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- 
               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling 
               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their 
               laces tied together.

               He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"

               EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY

               It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, 
               Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is 
               old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group 
               of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. 
               Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.

               What's more, all of these people are barefoot.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Friend!

               A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store 
               to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest 
               thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Welcome to ya. What's your name?

                                     EDWARD
                         Edward Bloom.

               Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips 
               forward a few pages. Still looking...

                                     BEAMEN
                         Bloom like a flower?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. 
                         We weren't expecting you yet.

               Still confused...

                                     EDWARD
                         You were expecting me?

                                     BEAMEN
                         Not yet.

               A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:

                                     MILDRED
                         You must have taken a shortcut.

                                     EDWARD
                         I did. It nearly killed me.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And 
                         truthfully, the long way is easier, 
                         but it's longer.

                                     MILDRED
                         Much longer.

                                     BEAMEN
                         And you're here now, and that's what 
                         matters.

               Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering 
               around to look at the handsome stranger.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is this place?

                                     BEAMEN
                         The town of Spectre. Best kept secret 
                         in Alabama. Says here you're from 
                         Ashton, right? Last person we had 
                         from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD
                         The poet? What ever happened to him?

                                     BEAMEN
                         He's still here. Let me buy you a 
                         drink. I'll tell you all about it. 
                         Hell, I'll have him tell you.

                                     EDWARD
                         No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm 
                         already running late.

               He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's 
               laughing.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Son, I already told you. You're early.

               INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of 
               apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), 
               who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never 
               left the state.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Now tell me if that isn't the best 
                         pie you ever ate.

                                     EDWARD
                         It truly is.

               UNDER THE TABLE

               Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Everything here tastes better. Even 
                         the water is sweet. Never gets too 
                         hot, too cold, too humid. At night 
                         the wind goes through the trees and 
                         you'd swear there was a whole symphony 
                         out there, playing just for you.

               Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the 
               door.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hey!

               He chases after her.

               EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY

               As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching 
               the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the 
               power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever 
               getting them down.

               The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is 
               confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his 
               hand.

               Still focused on his shoes...

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I need those!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There is no softer ground than town.

                                     MILDRED
                         That rhymes!

                                     BEAMEN
                         He is our poet laureate.

               The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward... 

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit 
                         places that seem instantly familiar, 
                         filled with friends you've never 
                         met.

               EXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK

               Edward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. 
               Thousands of them.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A man might travel his entire life 
                         and never find a place so inviting. 
                         My journey had scarcely begun, and I 
                         had arrived.

               Norther hands him his noteboook.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I've been working on this poem for 
                         12 years.

                                     EDWARD
                         Really.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There's a lot of expectation. I don't 
                         want to disappoint my fans.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's only three lines long.

               Norther grabs his notebook back.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is why you don't show work in 
                         progress.

                                     EDWARD
                         Norther, do you ever regret not making 
                         it to Paris?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I can't imagine any place better 
                         than here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're a poet. You oughta be able 
                         to. And maybe if you'd seen more, 
                         you could.

               Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT

               By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the 
               water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City 
               dangles around his neck.

               He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.

               It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.

               No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming 
               underwater. We never see her face.

               She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, 
               squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his 
               presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's 
               seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he 
               frighten her away.

               Then he sees the snake.

               It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, 
               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.

               There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward 
               dives in. He swims as hard as can,

               GRABBING THE SNAKE

               just as it's about to strike.

               The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified 
               that a man is coming at her.

                                     EDWARD
                         No, it's okay! I got it. I got the 
                         snake.

               As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in 
               his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common 
               stick. And a non-threatening one at that.

               While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover 
               that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her 
               face.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!

               Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she 
               never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what 
               tricks his eyes are playing on him.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                     A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         There's leeches in there!

               Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you see that woman?

                                     JENNY
                         What did she look like?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, she... uh...

                                     JENNY
                         Was she nekkid?

               Embarrassed to admit it...

                                     EDWARD
                         Yeah.

                                     JENNY
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         It's not a woman, it's a fish. No 
                         one ever catches her.

               Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow 
               up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.

                                     JENNY (CONT'D)
                         Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent 
                         people. My daddy said it looked like 
                         the coon dog he had when he was kid, 
                         back from the dead.

               Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He 
               pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging 
               to his skin.

                                     EDWARD
                         Shoot.

               He starts to work pulling them off.

               EXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT

               Edward and Jenny walk back.

                                     JENNY
                         How old are you?

                                     EDWARD
                         Eighteen.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm eight. That means when I'm 
                         eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 
                         28, you'll only be 38.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a little wary)
                         You're pretty good at arithmetic.

                                     JENNY
                         And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And 
                         that's not much difference at all.

               Eager to get off this subject...

                                     EDWARD
                         Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" 
               has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables 
               across the street, and a small stage has been built at one 
               end to hold FIDDLERS.

               The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, 
               Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed 
               him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.

               The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and 
               complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants 
               to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a 
               stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.

               Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.

               Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.

               Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear 
               over the MUSIC.

                                     MILDRED
                         Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. 
                         We all do.

                                     EDWARD
                              (not hearing)
                         What?

                                     MILDRED
                         I said you're quite a catch!

               Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of 
               the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have to leave. Tonight.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Why?

                                     EDWARD
                         This town is everything a man could 
                         ask for. And if I were to end up 
                         here, I'd consider myself lucky. But 
                         the fact is, I'm not ready to end up 
                         anywhere.

                                     BEAMEN
                         No one's ever left.

                                     JENNY
                         How are you gonna make it without 
                         your shoes?

                                     EDWARD
                         I suspect it will hurt a lot.

               And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople 
               stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.

               Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.

                                     BEAMEN
                              (calling after him)
                         You won't find a better place!

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't expect to.

               Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.

                                     JENNY
                         Promise me you'll come back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I promise. Someday. When I'm really 
                         supposed to.

               It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps 
               walking. 

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. 
               It's horrible. Almost unendurable.

               And then it gets worse.

               The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be 
               the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood 
               CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying 
               to block him.

               Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for 
               his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab 
               another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now 
               all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes 
               towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As difficult as it was to reach 
                         Spectre, I was fated to get there 
                         eventually. After all, no man can 
                         avoid reaching the end of his life.

               As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the 
               City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally 
               breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.

               Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees 
               have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush 
               him.

               He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.

                                     EDWARD
                         And then I realized, this wasn't the 
                         end of my life.

               With a sudden calm...

                                     EDWARD
                              (aloud)
                         This isn't how I die.

               Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back 
               where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn 
               in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING.

               EXT. THE ROAD - DAY

               His bare foot steps onto asphalt.

                                     A DEEP VOICE
                         Friend!

               Edward turns to see

               KARL

               to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.

                                     KARL
                         What happened to your shoes?

               Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.

                                     EDWARD
                         They got ahead of me.

               With that, the men start walking down the larger road.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra 
               and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small 
               plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's 
               exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain 
               the family dinner ritual.

               The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a 
               knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know if you've seen it, but 
                         Josephine has some photos in the 
                         most recent Newsweek.

                                     SANDRA
                         Really! That's wonderful.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I spent a week in Morocco for the 
                         story. It was incredible.

                                     SANDRA
                         We'll have to pick up a copy.

               A beat. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward 
               suddenly speaks:

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't know if you're aware of this, 
                         Josephine, but African parrots, in 
                         their native home of the Congo -- 
                         they speak only French.

               All three stop to listen.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (amused)
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're lucky to get four words out 
                         of them in English. But if you were 
                         to walk through the jungle, you'd 
                         hear them speaking the most elaborate 
                         French. Those parrots talk about 
                         everything: politics, movies, fashion -- 
                         everything but religion.

               Taking the bait...

                                     WILL
                         Why not religion, Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         It's rude to talk about religion. 
                         You never know who you're going to 
                         offend.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine actually went to the Congo 
                         last year.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh, so you know.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his 
               mother checks her list.

               AT THE PRODUCE SECTION

               Sandra starts to bag string beans.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, would you say you understand 
                         Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Of course.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, do you really know 
                         what's going on in his head? 

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                         How is that possible? I mean, you 
                         try to ask him a question and suddenly 
                         it's another one of his stories.
                              (decidedly)
                         You can't honestly say you know him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume 
                         things you don't know.

               She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous 
               territory.

                                     SANDRA
                         Would you say you understand 
                         Josephine?

                                     WILL
                         Yes. But that's a different...

                                     SANDRA
                         No it's not. It's exactly the same. 
                         Your father and I met, we dated, and 
                         we married -- we chose each other -- 
                         because we understood each other on 
                         some fundamental level. Just the 
                         same as you two.

               She moves on to the carrots.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine and I have a lot in common.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, you both think William Bloom is 
                         a very smart man.
                              (beat)
                         The problem is, you only see me as 
                         your mother, and not as someone's 
                         wife. And I've been his wife longer 
                         than I've been your mother. You can't 
                         discount that.

                                     WILL
                         True. But I've known him my whole 
                         life, and I don't feel like I know 
                         him at all. Or ever will.

               With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.

                                     SANDRA
                         I know it's not easy. Just remember, 
                         he didn't choose to be your father 
                         and you didn't choose to be his son. 
                         You just ended up together. You could 
                         pick numbers out of a dark bag and 
                         it'd be just the same. If you ask 
                         me, it's a wonder parents and children 
                         can stand each other at all.

                                     WILL
                         But I understand you, Mom. I always 
                         have.

                                     SANDRA
                         Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not 
                         the mystery you're trying to solve 
                         right now.

               INT. AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT

               Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons. Will is 
               approaching with a Newsweek magazine.

               Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's

               is getting her change. Though she's Sandra's generation, she 
               carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans 
               and sneakers.

               She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes. 
               We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra. 
               It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or 
               just find him attractive?

               Will notices the gaze. The woman turns away.

               Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?

                                     SANDRA
                         Before I forget, your father has 
                         papers in the basement I'd like you 
                         to go through. I wouldn't know what's 
                         important.

                                     WILL
                              (distracted)
                         Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde 
                         hair.

               Sandra looks. After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, 
               semi-casually. Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, 
               she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.

                                     SANDRA
                              (no idea)
                         Was she one of your teachers?

                                     WILL
                         No. But it's weird. She seemed to 
                         recognize me.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to the cashier)
                         Do you know who that is?

               The Cashier turns to look. He can only get a profile as the 
               woman leaves.

                                     CASHIER
                         Never seen her before. Pretty, though.

               INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner. Turned low, the 
               RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, 
               just a wash of background chatter. Edward lies asleep on his 
               back.

               At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade. She reaches 
               over Edward to switch off the radio. He stirs from the silence -- 
               he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                              (playfully lecherous)
                         Hello.

               She smiles.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Hi. How are you feeling?

                                     EDWARD
                         I was dreaming.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What were you dreaming about?

               He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine 
               motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't usually remember unless 
                         they're especially portentous. You 
                         know what that word means, portentous?

               She shakes her head.

                                     EDWARD
                         Means when you dream about something 
                         that's going to happen.
                              (beat, gathering)
                         Like one night, I had a dream where 
                         this crow came and told me, "Your 
                         Aunt is going to die." I was so scared 
                         I woke up my parents. They told me 
                         it was just a dream, to go back to 
                         bed. But the next morning, my Aunt 
                         Stacy was dead.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         That's terrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Terrible for her, but think about 
                         me, young boy with that kind of power. 
                         Wasn't three weeks later that the 
                         crow came back to me in a dream and 
                         said, "Your Grampa is going to die." 
                         Well, I ran right back to my parents. 
                         My father said, no, Gramps is fine, 
                         but I could see there was trepidation. 
                         And true enough, that next morning 
                         my Grampa was dead.

               He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.

                                     EDWARD
                         For the next couple weeks, I didn't 
                         have another dream. Until one night 
                         the crow came back and said, "Your 
                         Daddy is going to die."
                              (beat)
                         Well, I didn't know what to do. But 
                         finally I told my father. And he 
                         said not to worry, but I could tell 
                         he was rattled. That next day, he 
                         wasn't himself, always looking around, 
                         waiting for something to drop on his 
                         head. Because the crow didn't tell 
                         how it was going to happen, just 
                         those words: your Daddy is going to 
                         die. Well, he went into town early 
                         and was gone for a long time. And 
                         when he finally came back, he looked 
                         terrible, like he was waiting for 
                         the axe to fall all day. He said to 
                         my mother, "Good God. I just had the 
                         worst day of my life."
                              (beat)
                         "You think you've had a bad day," 
                         she said. "This morning the milkman 
                         dropped dead on the porch!" Josephine 
                         smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him 
                         smiling too.

               A long beat. Then, deadpan...

                                     EDWARD
                         Because see, my mother was banging 
                         the milkman.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No, I understand.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was slipping her a little extra 
                         cream.

               She nods, a bit more of a laugh.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was filling her basket. He was 
                         making deliveries around back.

               As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, 
               especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was buttering her rolls. Pumping 
                         her churn. Splashing milk in her 
                         box.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Stop.

                                     EDWARD
                         They were squeezing the cheese. 
                         Clanking the bottles. Licking the 
                         popsicle.

               She's starting to cry from laughing.

                                     EDWARD
                         Cracking the eggs and making an 
                         omelet.

               With that, he stops. She regains her composure.

                                     EDWARD
                         Spooning the sherbet.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (interrupting)
                         Can I take your picture?

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't need a picture. Just look 
                         up handsome in the dictionary.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Please?

               He rolls his eyes, why not.

               Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. 
               We STAY WITH Edward in bed.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         I have photos from the wedding to 
                         show you. There's a great one of you 
                         and my father. I had an extra print 
                         made.

               Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding 
               how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.

               He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I want to see pictures of your 
                         wedding. I've never seen any.

               She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job 
               masking the pain.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's because we didn't have a 
                         wedding. Your mother-in-law was never 
                         supposed to marry me. She was engaged 
                         to somebody else.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (loading film)
                         I never knew.

                                     EDWARD
                         Will never told you that?
                              (she shakes her head)
                         Probably just as well. He would have 
                         told it all wrong anyway. All the 
                         facts and none of the flavor.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Oh, so this is a tall tale?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, it's not a short one.

               A devilish smile. Pushing past Edward, we settle on the 
               whirling fan.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               SPINNING PINWHEEL

               held by a LITTLE BOY. He's slumped over his FATHER's shoulder, 
               being carried towards a big-top tent. We are...

               EXT. OLYMPIA CIRCUS - NIGHT

               ...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment 
               in an Alabama field. To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, 
               halfway through a bag of peanuts. He's still carrying the 
               backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip 
               through Spectre.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I had just left Ashton, and was on 
                         my way to discover my destiny. Not 
                         knowing what that would be exactly, 
                         I explored every opportunity that 
                         presented itself.

               Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

               A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act 
               to tremendous APPLAUSE.

               As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster 
               AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be 
               four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.

                                     AMOS
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think 
                         you've seen the unusual. You may 
                         think you've seen the bizarre. But 
                         I've travelled to the five corners 
                         of the world, and let me tell you, 
                         I've never seen anything like this.

               From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards 
               the crowd.

                                     AMOS
                         When I found this man, he was picking 
                         oranges in Florida. His fellow workers 
                         called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- 
                         because when you were working beside 
                         him, he blocked out the daylight. He 
                         could take a whole tree in his hands 
                         and shake off the fruit. I had to 
                         pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I 
                         could take him with me.

               Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a 
               quieter moment.

                                     AMOS
                         Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this 
                         man wanted to, he could crush your 
                         head between his toes.
                              (she trembles)
                         But he won't.
                              (a long beat)
                         He's not going to hurt her, folks, 
                         because he's our own Gentle Giant. 
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you 
                         Colossus!

               The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL 
               begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.

               A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. 
               That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. 
               Intrigued.

               As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. 
               Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This is 
               COLOSSUS.

               From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he 
               is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and 
               giant club, he seems more ogre than man.

               In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus 
               walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at 
               him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight 
               spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.

               Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with 
               the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.

               He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is 
               sitting on the dirt --

               KARL THE GIANT

               stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold 
               him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP 
               from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will 
               happen next?

               ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.

               ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned 
               shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into 
               the shadows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT / LATER

               As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos.

                                     AMOS
                         What's his name? Does he talk? It's 
                         not important.

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     AMOS
                         Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of 
                         the term "involuntary servitude?"

               Karl shakes his head.

                                     AMOS
                         "Unconscionable contract?"

               Nope.

                                     AMOS
                         Great, great. That's fantastic.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It was on that night Karl met his 
                         destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

               As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward 
               notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family. 
               She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she 
               looks back at Edward.

               The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.

               A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A 
               spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a 
               snowflake. Even the elephant is mid-poop.

               Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the 
               frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and 
               closer to this woman.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         They say when you meet the love of 
                         your life, time stops. And that's 
                         true. What they don't tell you, is 
                         that once time starts again, it moves 
                         extra fast to catch up.

               Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and 
               the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's 
               frozen, helpless in time.

               EXT. DIRT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his 
               fated love. Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running 
               down the rows.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               THE EMPTY LOT

               Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops 
               and lets him climb in back.

               As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll 
               never find that girl, the love of his life.

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT

               Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He 
               spots Edward walking back into the tent.

                                     AMOS
                         Hey kid! Your friend just made himself 
                         a star.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great.

               Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN.

                                     (INTRODUCING)
                         My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.

                                     EDWARD
                         Good to meet you.

               Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.

                                     AMOS
                         What's the matter with you, kid? I 
                         haven't seen a customer so depressed 
                         since the elephant sat on that 
                         farmer's wife.
                              (beat)
                         Get it? "Depressed?"

               Karl chuckles.

                                     AMOS
                         See! The big guy likes it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I just saw the woman I'm going to 
                         marry, I know it. But then I lost 
                         her.

                                     AMOS
                         Tough break. Most men have to get 
                         married before they lose their wives.

                                     EDWARD
                              (with absolute 
                              conviction)
                         I'm going to spend the rest of my 
                         life looking for her. That or die 
                         alone.

                                     AMOS
                         Jesus, kid.
                              (realizing)
                         Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde 
                         hair, blue hat?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes!

                                     AMOS
                         I know her uncle. Friends of the 
                         family.

                                     EDWARD
                         Who is she? Where does she live?

                                     AMOS
                         Kid. Don't waste your time. She's 
                         out of your league.

               As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with 
               him. Karl follows as well.

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you mean? You don't even 
                         know me.

                                     AMOS
                         Sure I do. You were hot shit back in 
                         Hickville, but here in the real world, 
                         you got squat. You don't have a plan. 
                         You don't have a job. You don't have 
                         anything but the clothes on your 
                         back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've got a whole backpack full of 
                         clothes!

               He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.

                                     EDWARD
                              (realizing)
                         Someone stole my backpack.

                                     AMOS
                         Kid, you were a big fish in a small 
                         pond. This here is the ocean, and 
                         you're drowning. Take my advice and 
                         go back to Puddleville. You'll be 
                         happy there.

               Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait. You said I don't have a plan. 
                         I do. I'm going to find that girl 
                         and marry her and spend the rest of 
                         my life with her.

               Amos smiles, amused.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't have a job, but I would have 
                         a job if you gave me one. And I may 
                         not have much, but I have more 
                         determination than any man you're 
                         ever going to meet.

                                     AMOS
                         Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll work night and day, and you 
                         won't have to pay me. You just have 
                         to tell me who she is.

               Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he 
               can say no. He shrugs. What the hell.

                                     AMOS
                         Every month you work for me, I'll 
                         tell you one thing about her. That's 
                         my final offer.

               Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. 
               We move into a MONTAGE:

               INT. BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to 
               the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it 
               in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are 
               just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward 
               is dead.

               The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes 
               Edward antsier.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I did everything 
                         Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of 
                         things he didn't. I'd go three days 
                         without stopping to eat, and four 
                         days without sleeping.

               EXT. THE HYDRA - DAY

               His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling 
               amusement park ride.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The only thing that kept me going 
                         was the promise of meeting the girl 
                         who would be my wife.

               Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the 
               spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the 
               gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the 
               air.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, 
               falling in the mud.

               His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he's 
               unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds. 
               To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles. He dodges 
               four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.

               He catches his breath, lucky.

               Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him 
               in the shoulder.

               EXT. BEHIND A TENT - DAY

               Karl the Giant bandages Edward's arm as well as he can. Amos 
               is walking past.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's been a month today.

               Amos stops, looks at the young man. Finally...

                                     AMOS
                         This girl, the love of your life. 
                         Her favorite flower is daffodils.

               He walks away. We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the 
               concept.

                                     EDWARD
                         Daffodils.
                              (to Karl)
                         Daffodils!

               INT. STABLES - DAY

               Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen. 
               But all he can think about is...

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Daffodils!

               The wonder of it. He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his 
               face.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         True to his word, every month Amos 
                         would tell me something new about 
                         the woman of my dreams.

               INT. A DARK PLACE - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest 
               bit of information.

                                     EDWARD
                         College! She's going to college!

               A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot...

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               ...out of a giant cannon.

               INT. STABLES - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Music! She likes music. I like music 
                         too!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the months, I learned a lot 
                         about the woman I was going to marry, 
                         but not her name, and not where to 
                         find her.

               That time had come. I couldn't wait any longer.

               EXT. AMOS CALLOWAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, 
               and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. 
               Not just that, there's MOANING coming from inside.

               But Edward KNOCKS anyway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I 
                         need to talk to you.

               Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the 
               door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.

               Edward turns the knob.

               Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a 
               massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green 
               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.

               Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his 
               throat. 

               Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but 
               the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold 
               on tight.

               Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES 
               scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of 
               his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.

               Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls 
               to his feet.

               The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready 
               for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming 
               the revolver at the dog.

               At the last moment...

                                     EDWARD
                         No, wait!

               Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches 
               Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.

               The carnies GASP.

               Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, 
               who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of 
               weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, 
               ready to strike it.

               Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces 
               excitedly, ready to play fetch.

               Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he 
               can. The dog bounds after it,

               SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.

               It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it 
               drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth.

                                     EDWARD
                         It was that night I discovered that 
                         most things you consider evil or 
                         wicked are simply lonely, and lacking 
                         in the social niceties.

               Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new 
               direction.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. FIELD - PRE-DAWN

               Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the 
               stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's 
               gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes 
               concerned.

               He follows it into the woods.

               INT. WOODS - DAWN

               Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. 
               He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as 
               Edward approaches.

                                     AMOS
                         Didn't kill anything, did I?

                                     EDWARD
                         A few rabbits, but I think one of 
                         them was already dead.

                                     AMOS
                         That would explain the indigestion.

               Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates.

                                     AMOS
                         I was wrong about you kid. You may 
                         not have much, but what you got, you 
                         got a lot of. You could get any girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's only one I want.

               A beat.

                                     AMOS
                         Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's 
                         going to Auburn. The semester's almost 
                         over, so you better hurry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Thank you.

                                     AMOS
                         Good luck, kid.

               Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there 
               as soon as possible.

               Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot.

               EXT. BIG TOP - DAY

               Edward shakes Karl's giant hand. They hug.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After saying my goodbyes, I hopped 
                         three trains to get to Auburn that 
                         afternoon.

               EXT. AUBURN UNIVERSITY - DAY

               We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking 
               his head in the fountain.

               He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out 
               of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative 
               dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-
               open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG 
               WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't 
               see.

               Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the 
               woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's 
               effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.

               He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, 
               nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on.

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't know me, but my name is 
                         Edward Bloom and I am in love with 
                         you. I've spent the last three years 
                         working to find out who you are. 
                         I've been shot and stabbed and 
                         trampled a few times, had my ribs 
                         broken twice, but it's all worth it 
                         to see you here, now, and to finally 
                         get to talk to you. Because I am 
                         destined to marry you. I knew that 
                         from the first moment I saw you at 
                         the circus. And I know it now more 
                         than ever.

               ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say 
               is...

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't need to apologize to me. I 
                         mean, I'm the luckiest person you're 
                         going to find today...

               She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, 
               we see a diamond.

                                     SANDRA
                         No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be 
                         married.

               ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress 
               the reaction, put on a brave front.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh.

                                     SANDRA
                         But you're wrong. I do know you, at 
                         least by reputation. Edward Bloom 
                         from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged 
                         to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He 
                         was a few years older than you.

                                                              FLASHCUTS TO:

               EXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT

               Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward.

               VARIOUS H.S. ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS 93

               Recapping earlier football, baseball and basketball 
               highlights, we find Edward beats Don every time.

               THE STREET CORNER / ASHTON PARADE

               A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves 
               town.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT/INT. SORORITY HOUSE - THE DOORWAY

               Edward is dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster...

                                     EDWARD
                         Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to 
                         have bothered you.

               He turns and walks down the front steps.

               She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely 
               horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back 
               inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters 
               get to the bottom of this.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it. It's not funny. That poor 
                         boy.

               We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Fate has a cruel way of circling 
                         around on you. After all this work 
                         to leave Ashton, the girl I loved 
                         was now engaged to one of its biggest 
                         jerks.

               He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the 
               background.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There's a time when a man needs to 
                         fight, and a time when he needs to 
                         accept that his destiny is lost, 
                         that the ship has sailed, and that 
                         only a fool would continue.

               A beat. Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority 
               house.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I've always been a 
                         fool.

               We CIRCLE as he shouts:

                                     EDWARD
                         Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I 
                         am going to marry you!

               INT. SORORITY HOUSE FOYER - DAY

               Sandra and her SISTERS peer out through the curtains. Is 
               this guy crazy?

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               The tweedy ECONOMICS PROFESSOR continues his explanation. 
               Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention.

               He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it. 
               There's a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn't notice.

               A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up. Written on the 
               projector is "I Love Sandra Templeton." She's horrified and 
               excited at the same time. The professor finally notices what's 
               written there.

               EXT. QUAD - DAY

               Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving. 
               We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart 
               floats in the wind.

               INT. SANDRA'S BEDROOM - [THE NEXT] MORNING

               At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the 
               second-story window to find the lawn filled with

               TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.

               Edward stands amid the sea of flowers. He's waited there six 
               hours.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra walks out to him. She's smiling, confused, joyful and 
               scared. All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to 
               see the display.

                                     SANDRA
                         Daffodils?

                                     EDWARD
                         They're your favorite flower.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get so many?

                                     EDWARD
                         I called everywhere in five states 
                         and explained this was the only way 
                         I could get my wife to marry me.

               Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. She wipes 
               it off.

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't even know me.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have the rest of my life to find 
                         out.

               From down the street...

                                     A MAN'S VOICE
                         Sandra!

                                     SANDRA
                         It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt 
                         him.

                                     EDWARD
                         If that's what you want, I swear to 
                         it.

               The adult DON PRICE arrives. He's 230 pounds of football-
               playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle. And he's 
               pissed.

               A gang of his BROTHERS walk behind him.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Bloom!

                                     EDWARD
                         Don.

                                     DON PRICE
                         What the hell are you doing? This is 
                         my girl. Mine!

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't know she belonged to anybody.

               Don Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right 
               back up, but makes no move to defend himself.

               Unfazed, Don slugs him again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it!

                                     DON PRICE
                              (ignoring)
                         What the matter, Bloom? Too scared 
                         to fight back?

                                     EDWARD
                         I promised I wouldn't.

               A beat. Don shrugs, fine. Then proceeds to kick Edward's ass 
               nine ways to Sunday.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         While I took the beating of a 
                         lifetime, it was Don Price who was 
                         ultimately defeated.

               As the ass-whupping continues, we 

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [FLASHFORWARD]

               Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading 
               the new Playboy.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         All the physical activity had worsened 
                         a congenital valve defect. Put simply, 
                         his heart wasn't strong enough.

               Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. 
               Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on 
               the tile.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. WITCH'S HOUSE / GATE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

               The same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected 
               in The Eye.

                                                         RETURNING BACK TO:

               EXT. THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               The thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back 
               to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Don!

               Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.

               Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible 
               AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers.

                                     SANDRA
                         I will never marry you.

               A beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.

               Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting 
               for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on?

                                     DON PRICE
                         What. You love this guy?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's almost a stranger and I prefer 
                         him to you. 

               She hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off. 
               But not before decking Edward one last time.

               Sandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the 
               daffodils.

                                     SANDRA
                         How can I convince you to stop?

                                     EDWARD
                         Go out with me.

               He smiles, his teeth bloody.

                                     SANDRA
                         Okay.

               As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP 
               above the flowered battlefield.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As it turned out, Sandra was able to 
                         keep her same date at the chapel. 
                         Only the groom had changed.

               As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT [PRESENT]

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I thought you said you didn't have a 
                         church wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, we were all set to, but there 
                         was a complication.

               He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has 
               it for him. She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire 
               glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the 
               stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Is it the medicine that's making you 
                         thirsty?

                                     EDWARD (O.S.)
                         Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole 
                         life. Never really known why.

               Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but 
               not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few 
               inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.

               INTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM

                                     EDWARD
                         There was one time when I was 
                         eleven...

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (gently)
                         You were talking about your wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't forget. I was just working 
                         on a tangent. See, most men, they'll 
                         tell a story straight through, and 
                         it won't be complicated, but it won't 
                         be interesting either.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I like your stories.

                                     EDWARD
                         And I like you.

               He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality. 
               There's a story to be told.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now. The thing about working for a 
                         circus is you don't have a regular 
                         address, and after three years I had 
                         a lot of undelivered mail.

               In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself 
               listen to the story one more time.

                                     EDWARD
                         During the four weeks I was in the 
                         hospital, the postmaster finally 
                         caught up with me.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail 
               with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking 
               letter. Reading it, his face drops.

               FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out that while my heart 
                         belonged to Sandra, the rest of my 
                         body belonged to the U.S. Government.

               INT. ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT

               With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a 
               dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, 
               but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A hitch in the Army was up to three 
                         years at that point, and having waited 
                         three years just to meet Sandra, I 
                         knew I couldn't survive being away 
                         from her that long. So I took every 
                         hazardous assignment I could find, 
                         with the hope of getting my time 
                         down to less than a year.

               The JUMP LEADER yells...

                                     JUMP LEADER
                         GO! GO! GO!

               One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main 
               line. When his time comes, Edward leaps...

               ...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly.

               He twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking 
               down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the 
               darkness. They're already long gone.

               Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting 
               through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the 
               plane.

               EXT. OUTSIDE STAGE - NIGHT

               A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the 
               equivalent of a U.S.O. show.

               A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. 
               We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every 
               act is fundamentally the same.

               The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's 
               finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. 
               The Emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of 
               the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

               EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE STAGE - NIGHT

               We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. 
               He can't steer. He's helpless.

               But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage. 
               The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough 
               cover for Edward to remain unseen.

               He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. 
               He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the 
               curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited 
               soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless 
               cricket left on the anthill.

               EXT. ON STAGE

               The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's 
               as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see.

               She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a 
               knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their 
               feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.

               UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. 
               The two men begin to SCUFFLE.

               MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an 
               off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.

                                     PING
                         Sometimes a girl can feel so alone 
                         Without a lover to call her own. 
                         Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to 
                         explode. 
                         Wants to grab the first man she sees 
                         and tear off his clothes.

               A ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want.

               Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of 
               the catwalk, sliding down it to end up

               BACKSTAGE.

               His determined opponent follows him down.

                                     PING (CONT'D)
                         But she won't.
                         No, she can't. 
                         She needs a special special different 
                         unusual man. 
                         Because that girl, 
                         Who looks like me, 
                         She has wants, but she has needs.

                                     PING
                              (speaking)
                         Any of you got needs?

               The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.

               Backstage, the two men are still fighting.

                                     PING
                              (chorus)
                         I've had twice the adventure, 
                         Cried double the tears. 
                         Two times the bad times in half the 
                         years. 
                         I need a strong man, because I've 
                         got 
                         Twice the love to give.

               For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was 
               standing in profile. Ping is one-half of

               SIAMESE TWINS.

               Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all 
               this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist, 
               one set of perfect legs beneath them.

               Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It 
               costs him a punch to the jaw.

                                     PING
                         Say hello, Jing.

                                     JING
                         Hello Jing.

                                     PING
                              (to the crowd)
                         I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good 
                         one.
                              (closer)
                         I'm the bad one.

               As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the 
               fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.

               As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final 
               pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, 
               their backs forming the curves.

               Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.

               The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving. 
               The curtain slowly lowers, revealing

               EDWARD'S PARACHUTE.

               The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee 
               yells for the Guards to search.

               ON STAGE

               Ping has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her 
               cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and 
               Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet, 
               they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities 
               become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, 
               while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.

               In Chinese, subtitled...

                                     PING
                         How could you miss your cue? You 
                         make me look like a fool, out there 
                         alone.

                                     JING
                         You weren't alone.

               Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister.

               Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, 
               exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to 
               look.

                                     PING
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     EDWARD
                              (in Chinese)
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

                                     PING
                         Damn right you're not.
                              (yelling)
                         GUARD!

               Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A 
               rifle-toting GUARD looks in.

               Pretending to be her bitchy sister --

                                     JING
                         Tell your men not to bother us! And 
                         lock that door!

               The guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Desperately 
               flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds...

                                     EDWARD
                         Please, I need your help.

                                     PING
                         What makes you think we'll help you?

               Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. It's Sandra.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               VARIOUS SHOTS

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the next hour, I described my 
                         love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and 
                         the ordeal that brought me before 
                         them. As it had always been, this 
                         love was my salvation. It was destined 
                         to be.

               Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear. Even Ping is a 
               little affected.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         We put together an elaborate plan 
                         for escape, involving a whaling ship 
                         to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a 
                         small, dirty canoe to Miami. We all 
                         knew it would be dangerous.

               Still subtitled:

                                     PING
                         And what are we supposed to do when 
                         we get to America?

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get you bookings. I know the 
                         biggest man in show business.

                                     JING
                         Bob Hope?

                                     EDWARD
                         Bigger.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so the twins and I began our 
                         arduous journey halfway around the 
                         world. Unfortunately, there was no 
                         way to send a message back to America.

               A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so it was no surprise that the 
                         Army believed I was dead.

               Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. The pain of her shout 
               makes church bells RING.

               EXT. BEHIND THE TEMPLETON HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a 
               tunnel of fabric.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After four months, Sandra had gotten 
                         over the worst of the nightmares. 
                         When the phone rang, she didn't think 
                         it was somehow me calling her. When 
                         a car drove past, she didn't get up 
                         to check out the window.

               Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see

               A MAN'S SILHOUETTE

               on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow 
               ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the 
               breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead.

               She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she 
               hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.

               Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing 
               before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. 
               It is destiny.

               Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

               filters through soft sheets. We're under the covers, where a 
               man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat, 
               then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be

               JOSEPHINE.

               She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her. 
               He's been up for a while. We are actually...

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               ...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind 
               of limbo. A kiss good morning. Legs entangling. Neither wants 
               to get up.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I talked with your father last night.

                                     WILL
                         Did you?

               A look to say, should I be worried?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You never told me how your parents 
                         met.

                                     WILL
                         They met at Auburn.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What about the details? How they 
                         fell in love. The Circus. The War. 
                         You never told me any of that.

                                     WILL
                         That's because most of it never 
                         happened.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's romantic.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                              (non-committal)
                         Mmm.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Mmm, what?

                                     WILL
                         Mmm, what. I know better than to 
                         argue romance with a French woman.

               He moves his head out from under the sheet. She follows him 
               to the "outside."

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Do you love your father?

                                     WILL
                         Everyone loves my father. He's a 
                         very likeable guy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (repeating)
                         Do you love him?

               Will doesn't want to answer yes or no.

                                     WILL
                         You have to understand. When I was 
                         growing up, he was gone more than he 
                         was here. And I started thinking -- 
                         maybe he has a second life somewhere 
                         else. With another house, another 
                         family. He leaves us, he goes to 
                         them. Or maybe there is no family. 
                         Maybe he never wanted a family. But 
                         whatever it is, maybe he likes that 
                         second life better. And the reason 
                         he tells all those stories is because 
                         he can't stand this boring place.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's not true.

                                     WILL
                         What is "true?" I've never heard my 
                         father say a single true thing.

               Off her silence...

                                     WILL
                         Look, I know why you like him. I 
                         know why everyone likes him. But I 
                         need you to tell me I'm not crazy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You're not.

                                     WILL
                         I need you on my side.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I am always on your side. And I think 
                         you should talk to him.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up 
               around the bed. For his part, Edward is looking better. 
               Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his 
               expression. And for the first time, he's actually hungry.

               He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I ever tell you about how...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Yes.

               Edward is startled.

                                     WILL
                         The maple tree and the Buick. We 
                         heard it.

                                     EDWARD
                              (re: Josephine)
                         I think someone hasn't.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         The tree fell on the car, spilling 
                         the syrup, which attracted the flies, 
                         which got stuck to it and flew off 
                         with the whole car.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                              (undeterred)
                         But the real story is how I got the 
                         car. You see...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Son?

                                     WILL
                         Can we talk?

               Sandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to get started on dishes.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'll help you.

               Both women quickly gather plates.

               Will and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to 
               happen. It settles for a beat after they leave.

                                     WILL
                         Do you know much about icebergs, 
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They 
                         were hauling it down to Texas for 
                         drinking water, only they didn't 
                         count on an elephant being frozen 
                         inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad!

                                     EDWARD
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

                                     EDWARD
                         Then you shouldn't have started with 
                         a question. Because people want to 
                         answer questions. You should have 
                         started with, "The thing about 
                         icebergs is..."

                                     WILL
                              (frustrated)
                         The thing about icebergs is you only 
                         see 10 percent of them. The other 90 
                         percent is below the water where you 
                         can't see it. And that's what it is 
                         with you Dad. I'm only seeing this 
                         little bit that sticks above the 
                         water.

                                     EDWARD
                              (joking)
                         What, you're seeing down to my nose? 
                         My chin?

                                     WILL
                         I have no idea who you are because 
                         you have never told me a single fact.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've told you a thousand facts. That's 
                         all I do, Will. I tell stories.

                                     WILL
                         You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing 
                         lies. Stories are what you tell a 
                         five-year old at bedtime. They're 
                         not elaborate mythologies you maintain 
                         when your son is ten and fifteen and 
                         twenty and thirty. And the thing is, 
                         I believed you. I believed your 
                         stories so much longer than I should 
                         have. And then when I realized that 
                         everything you said was impossible -- 
                         everything! -- I felt like such a 
                         fool to have trusted you. You were 
                         like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny 
                         combined. Just as charming and just 
                         as fake.

                                     EDWARD
                         You think I'm fake.

                                     WILL
                         Only on the surface. But that's all 
                         I've ever seen.

               Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my 
                         own here. It would kill me if he 
                         went through his whole life never 
                         understanding me.

                                     EDWARD
                         It would kill you, huh?

               Finally --

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you want, Will? Who do you 
                         want me to be?

                                     WILL
                         Yourself. Good, bad, everything. 
                         Just show me who you are for once.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have been nothing but myself since 
                         the day I was born. And if you can't 
                         see that, it's your failing, not 
                         mine.

               EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

               With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out 
               of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long 
               since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, 
               slime covering the cemented rocks.

               Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's 
               surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which 
               disappears into the murky water.

               A beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He 
               casually walks away.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring 
               into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of 
               hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built 
               outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian 
               lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to 
               sell.

               Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its 
               ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit 
               beside it.

                                     SANDRA
                         Your father decided he needed to 
                         have an office, and it wouldn't do 
                         to have it in the house. You'll know 
                         better than me what's important.

               With some effort, Will forces up the desktop. With a HISS, a 
               neighbor's cat makes a run for it. Will's getting used to 
               being startled.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]

               Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash 
               bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file, 
               Sandra makes a small sound. A memory.

                                     WILL
                         What is it?

               Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. He shares it with 
               Josephine.

                                     SANDRA
                         It was during the war. Your father 
                         went missing. They thought he was 
                         dead.

               Will can't believe what he's reading.

                                     WILL
                         That really happened?

                                     SANDRA
                         Not everything your father says is a 
                         complete fabrication.

               A beat, then Sandra stands.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to check on him.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I need to lie down for a bit.

                                     WILL
                         Go.

               Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the 
               telegram, still bewildered.

               Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange 
               mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically.

               Will smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device 
               in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the 
               hand.

               Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After the war, the sons of Alabama 
                         returned home, looking for work. 
                         Each had an advantage over me. They 
                         were alive, while I was -- officially -- 
                         deceased.

               INT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE - DAY [STORY]

               Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN. The 
               company is called "Confederated Products." The OFFICE LADIES 
               all love Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         With my prospects few, I took a job 
                         as a travelling salesman. It suited 
                         me. If there's one thing you can say 
                         about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a 
                         social person.

               EXT. COUNTY FAIR - DAY [STORY]

               On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to 
               the crowd.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've travelled from Tennessee to 
                         Timbuktu, and if there's one thing 
                         people have in common, is we could 
                         all use a hand around the house.

               Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a 
               metal lava lamp. Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five 
               fingers and a thumb. This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)

                                     EDWARD
                         Why, with this product you can...

               QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:

                                     EDWARD
                         Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch 
                         yourself while wearing mittens. Hold 
                         a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog 
                         away from kittens. It's strong enough, 
                         you can do a handstand with no hands 
                         at all.

               Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his 
               entire weight on it. The crowd APPLAUDS.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can use it to point out important 
                         information. Or dangers. Or beautiful 
                         women.

               The hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS.

                                     EDWARD
                         We're still working on that one.

               The crowd LAUGHS.

               EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Edward drives, his hand out in the wind.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Soon I added other products, and 
                         other cities, until my territory 
                         stretched from the coast to western 
                         Texas.

               EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

               Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as 
               ever.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I could be gone for weeks at a time. 
                         But every other Friday, I'd put all 
                         the money I'd made into an account 
                         set aside for a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               EXT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               Establishing this Texas institution, we come...

               INT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd. Taking his place 
               in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip.

               As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front 
               of him gets a look at Edward.

                                     THE MAN
                         Edward? Edward Bloom?

               The man is none other than...

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         It's me. Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was astonished to see the greatest 
                         poet of both Ashton and Spectre all 
                         the way out in Texas.

               The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't believe it!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I want you to know, when you left 
                         Spectre it opened my eyes. There was 
                         a whole life out there that I was 
                         not living. So I travelled. I saw 
                         France, and Africa, half of South 
                         America. Every day a new adventure, 
                         that's my motto.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great, Norther. I'm happy for 
                         you. I can't believe I helped.

               He's genuinely proud.

                                     EDWARD
                         So what are you up to now?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I'm robbing this place.

               Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols 
               out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.

               SCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a 
               halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. 
               The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to Edward)
                         Would you mind grabbing that?

               There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might 
               as well be asking for a Budweiser. Still, Edward senses it 
               would be best to do as he says. He takes the guard's gun.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to the crowd)
                         Now, I want all of you to lie down. 
                         I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash 
                         drawers, and my associate here is 
                         going to handle the vault. 
                              (pointing to a Teller 
                              Woman)
                         You help my friend, okay?

               The TELLER WOMAN nods.

               ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he 
               truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is 
               already waving him to the back.

               He decides he better go.

               INT. AT THE VAULT - DAY

               The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination. 
               Edward feels horrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I'm really sorry. I just don't 
                         want anybody to get hurt.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         It's not that, it's just...

               She pulls open the vault door.

               INT. THE VAULT - DAY

               The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds 
               exactly one folding chair. Nothing else.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         ...there's no money. We're completely 
                         bankrupt.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out the savings and loan 
                         had already been robbed -- not by 
                         armed bandits, but by speculators in 
                         Texas real estate.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                              (dead serious)
                         You gotta promise you won't tell 
                         anybody.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DAY

               Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're 
               going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following 
               them. It's an empty country road for miles.

               Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars! 
                         Not bad for just the drawers. Let's 
                         see what you got from the vault.

               Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through 
               the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single 
               deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little 
               cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is it? The whole vault.

                                     EDWARD
                         'Fraid so.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, it's got your deposit slip 
                         on it.

               Caught, Edward has to confess...

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I just didn't want you to go 
                         empty-handed. There's something you 
                         should know, Norther. You see, the 
                         reason why...

               Edward continues his narration...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I told Norther about the vagaries of 
                         Texas oil money and its effect on 
                         real estate prices, and how lax 
                         enforcement of fiduciary process had 
                         made savings and loans particularly 
                         vulnerable.

               Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:

               EXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY

               Norther leans in the driver's side window.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I should go to Wall Street. That's 
                         where all the money is.

               Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I knew then that while my days as a 
                         criminal were over, Norther's were 
                         just beginning.

               The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the 
               last moment, Norther calls out:

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, thank you for the hand!

               He's talking about his Hand Around the House. We HOLD ON 
               Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         When Norther made his first million 
                         dollars, he sent me a check for ten 
                         thousand. I protested, but he said 
                         it was my fee as his career advisor.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE [MID/LATE '70'S] - DAY

               Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to 
               greet Edward, just returned from another trip.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Ten thousand dollars is no fortune 
                         to most men. But it was enough to 
                         buy my wife a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. 
               Edward kisses his wife.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And for that, it was all the riches 
                         a man could ever want.

               Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [PRESENT]

               CLOSE ON Edward's hand as he turns knobs.

               CLOSE ON water SPLASHING into the claw-foot bathtub, which 
               begins to fill.

               Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub. 
               Carefully lowers himself.

               As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, 
               Edward suddenly slides

               UNDERWATER.

               Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's 
               quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the 
               spigot. Edward's eyes are closed.

               A long beat. Another. Then the SPLASHING water goes silent. 
               Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find

               SANDRA

               sitting on the edge of the tub. She doesn't seem particularly 
               worried -- her husband has always done this.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was drying out.

                                     SANDRA
                         I see. We need to get you one of 
                         those plant misters. We can spray 
                         you like a fern.

               He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in 
               the tub. A beat while she considers.

               Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, 
               facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.

               He leans forward and kisses her. When they separate, she has 
               tears hanging in her eyes.

                                     EDWARD
                         Come now.

               He wipes them away.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't think I'll ever dry out.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another 
               file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but 
               usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash.

               He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look. 
               Something doesn't make sense.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE / STAIRS - DAY

               Will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the 
               corner with an armful of laundry, including her wet dress.

                                     WILL
                         Is he awake?

                                     SANDRA
                         He just fell asleep. Josephine's 
                         with him.

               She passes him. He turns.

                                     WILL
                         Mom?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes?

               Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her...

                                     WILL
                         Did you and Dad have any other 
                         property?

                                     SANDRA
                              (thinking)
                         I suppose your grandmother's house 
                         when she passed on. But we sold that 
                         right away. Your cousin Shirley bought 
                         it.

                                     WILL
                         So you never bought any land.

                                     SANDRA
                         Heavens no. We had a hard enough 
                         time keeping the mortgage on this 
                         place.

               Will nods, just curious. He continues heading up.

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               Will changes his shirt. Takes his keys off the nightstand.

               EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY

               Will's rental car drives past a sign reading, "Ashton, 10 
               miles."

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will checks the address on one of his father's files.

               EXT. ASHTON GAS - DAY

               Will talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction, 
               then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar. And 
               then we realize why: a roadsign reads "Welcome to Spectre!"

               EXT. A LONE HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels 
               lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through 
               the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.

               As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He 
               checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded 
               by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. 
               Will notices this.

               Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly.

               Re-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will KNOCKS. 
               The piano stops.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Go back to the start. Right hand 
                         only.

               The piano starts again. FOOTSTEPS.

               The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the 
               woman from the grocery store. Her name is Jenny Hill.

               She and Will are startled to see each other.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh. Oh.

                                     WILL
                         Hello.

                                     JENNY
                         I wasn't expecting you.

               Confused, Will checks the name on the form.

                                     WILL
                         Are you Jenny Hill?

                                     JENNY
                         I am. And you're Will. I've seen 
                         your picture, that's how I recognize 
                         you. I almost said something at the 
                         store, but it would have been awkward.
                              (a beat)
                         Like this.

               The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped. He's 
               watching the conversation at the door. Speaking of awkward...

                                     JENNY
                              (to the student)
                         Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the 
                         lesson today? We can go again next 
                         week.

               She hands him five dollars out of her pocket.

                                     STUDENT
                         Do I have to give it back to my Mom?

                                     JENNY
                         I won't tell her if you won't.

               You don't have to tell him twice. He's out the door in a 
               flash.

               INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN - DAY

               While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she 
               never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will.

                                     WILL
                         How did you know my father?

                                     JENNY
                         This was on his sales route, so he 
                         was through here all the time. 
                         Everyone in town knew him.

               A beat. Not flinching...

                                     WILL
                         Were you and my father having an 
                         affair?

                                     JENNY
                              (taken aback)
                         Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was 
                         expecting to dance around this for 
                         another half hour.

                                     WILL
                         I've seen him with women. He flirts. 
                         He always has. On some level, I 
                         presumed he was cheating on my mother. 
                         I just never had proof.

               She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her 
               into. Once she's finally free...

                                     JENNY
                         Can I ask you a question? Why did 
                         you come here today? If you found 
                         this deed, why didn't you just ask 
                         Eddie?

                                     WILL
                         Because he's dying.

               A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. 
               She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.

                                     JENNY
                         Look, I don't know how much you want 
                         to know about any of this. You have 
                         one image of your father and it would 
                         be wrong for me to go and change it. 
                         Especially this late in the game.

                                     WILL
                         My father talked about a lot of things 
                         he never did, and I'm sure he did a 
                         lot of things he never talked about. 
                         I'm just trying to reconcile the 
                         two.

               Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.

                                     JENNY
                         The first thing you have to 
                         understand, is that your father never 
                         meant to end up here. And yet he 
                         did, twice. The first time, he was 
                         early. The second time, he was late.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT

               It's late, and Edward is pensive.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Those days, your father was working 
                         for himself. If there was one thing 
                         you could say about Edward Bloom, 
                         it's that he was a social person, 
                         and people took a liking to him. One 
                         night he was returning from three 
                         weeks on the road, when he hit a 
                         thunderstorm unlike any in his life.

               The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the 
               wipers.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]

               Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore -- 
               there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught 
               in a waterfall. It's that loud.

               No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just 
               as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but 
               softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because --

               EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT

               -- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, 
               but where there used to be air is water.

               Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.

               INT. THE CAR - NIGHT

               Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is 
               trickling in through the crack between the window and the 
               door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine.

               That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.

               She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face 
               exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, 
               as the first time we saw her.

               She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet 
               hers. And smiles.

                                                              FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY

               It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees 
               drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain.

               Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his 
               suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from

               HIS CAR,

               which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As 
               Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny 
               piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out, 
               rubs it off.

               It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Fate has a way of circling back on a 
                         man, and taking him by surprise.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a 
               one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign...

                                  "Welcome to Spectre."

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the 
               road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to 
               find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, 
               along with the rest of the town's.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A man sees things differently at 
                         different times in his life. This 
                         town didn't seem the same now that 
                         he was older.

               EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS

               We look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are 
               "FOR SALE" signs in many of the windows

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A new road had brought the outside 
                         world to Spectre, and with it, banks, 
                         liens and debt. Almost everywhere 
                         you looked, people were bankrupt.

               EXT. SPECTRE - DAY

               We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward 
               watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among 
               the bidders.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Two different corporations were 
                         looking at buying the town, if they 
                         could get the price low enough. One 
                         wanted to open a chicken processing 
                         plant. The other, a municipal dump. 
                         Either way, Spectre would be 
                         destroyed.

               Edward raises his hand.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fifty-thousand!

               Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And so Edward Bloom decided to buy 
                         the town, in order to save it.

               INT. NORTHER WINSLOW'S MANHATTAN - DAY

               Edward pitches his plan to Norther.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         He was never a wealthy man, but he 
                         had made other men rich, and now he 
                         asked for their favors.

               INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward 
               talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most of them had never seen Spectre -- 
                         they only had Edward's words to 
                         describe it. That's all they needed. 
                         He sold them on the dream.

                                     JING
                         You can structure it as a historical 
                         trust. But you'll need every 
                         contiguous piece of property. It's 
                         all or nothing.

               As Edward takes notes...

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         So first he bought the farms. Then 
                         he bought the houses. Then he bought 
                         the stores.

               INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAY

               Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Whatever he bought, the people were 
                         not asked to leave or pay rent or 
                         anything. They were just asked to 
                         keep doing as they were doing. In 
                         that way, he could make sure the 
                         town would never die.

               EXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY

               Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally 
               stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the 
               trees' thick canopy.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Within six months, his trust had 
                         purchased the entire town. With one 
                         exception.

               In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. 
               He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around 
               his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.

               We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS 
               on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire 
               burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.

               With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. 
               Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to 
               have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...

                                     JENNY
                         You must be Edward Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         How did you know?

               She keeps PLAYING.

                                     JENNY
                         No one would come out here unless 
                         they had business. And no one would 
                         have business with me except for 
                         you. You're buying the town.

                                     EDWARD
                         Apparently I've overlooked this one 
                         piece of it, and I'd like to remedy 
                         that. You see, in order for the town 
                         to be preserved, the trust must own 
                         it in its entirety.

                                     JENNY
                         So I've heard.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll offer you more than it's worth. 
                         And you know you won't have to move. 
                         Nothing will change except the name 
                         on the deed, you have my word.

               Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns 
               to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.

                                     JENNY
                         Now let me get this straight. You'll 
                         buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay 
                         in it. You'll own the house, but 
                         it'll still be mine. I'll be here, 
                         and you'll come and go as you please 
                         to one place or another. Do I have 
                         that right?

               Strange to hear it put that way, but --

                                     EDWARD
                         In so many words, yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If 
                         nothing is going to change, I'd just 
                         as soon it not change in the way it 
                         hasn't been changing all this time.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's not like you're going to lose 
                         anything. You can ask anyone in town. 
                         I've been nothing if not generous. I 
                         want the best for everyone.

               A long beat.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this 
                         land? Some sort of midlife crisis? 
                         Instead of buying a convertible, you 
                         buy a town?

               He looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really 
               asked before.

                                     EDWARD
                         Helping people makes me happy.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm not convinced you should be happy.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry. Have I offended you?

               She finally turns to face him.

                                     JENNY
                         No, you did exactly what you promised. 
                         You came back. I was just expecting 
                         you sooner.

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

               EXT. SPECTRE - NIGHT

               Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for 
               the first time.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               Finally realizing who this woman is...

                                     EDWARD
                         You're Beamen's daughter. Your last 
                         name is different.
                              (realizing)
                         You married.

                                     JENNY
                         I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that 
                         was a big difference.

               Before he can say anything more...

                                     JENNY
                         I won't be selling you this house, 
                         Mr. Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         I see. I thank you for your time.

               A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.

               EXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAY

               Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it 
               breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping 
               for.

               Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.

               Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they 
               SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry.

               He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps 
               slipping.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay, just leave it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get it. I can just...

               He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then 
               falls in, SMASHING a small table.

                                     EDWARD
                         Lord, I'm sorry I...

                                     JENNY
                         Please. Go. Just go.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll...

                                     JENNY
                         Go.

               She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he 
               finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.

               We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's 
               something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most men in that situation would 
                         accept their failure and move on. 
                         But Edward was not like most men.

               EXT. SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

               With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door 
               from a pickup truck.

               EXT. SHACK - DAY

               While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries 
               to set the door square. Karl pushes against the side of the 
               house until it fits.

               INT. SHACK - ANOTHER DAY

               Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows 
               himself. Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's 
               telling.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As the months passed, he found more 
                         and more things to fix, until the 
                         shack no longer resembled itself.

               EXT. SWAMP - ANOTHER DAY

               Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.

               Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to 
               see the shack is now

               THE LOVELY HOUSE

               we saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and 
               a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is 
               impossibly charming.

               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. 
               Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. 
               And watching him with deepest affection.

                                     EDWARD
                         Of course, the best part was creating 
                         new material. By the time the twins 
                         and I got to Havana, we had a whole 
                         new routine worked out for them, 
                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

               Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and 
               hangs it on the rack. Perfect.

               A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's 
               no reason for him to be staying any longer.

                                     EDWARD
                         I suppose I should...

               He takes his hat off the rack.

                                     JENNY
                         You can leave it there.

               A beat. Does she really mean it?

               She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his 
               hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close -- 
               just a half-inch from kissing him when --

               -- Edward gently holds her back.

                                     EDWARD
                         No.

               She freezes, stunned and humiliated. She pulls away.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should 
                         never have let you think that...
                              (beat)
                         I am in love with my wife.

                                     JENNY
                         I know.

                                     EDWARD
                         And from the moment I saw her until 
                         the moment I die, she's the only 
                         one.

                                     JENNY
                         Lucky girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

               With that, he begins to leaves.

                                     JENNY
                         Wait! Edward!

               She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house. 
               Hands it to him. With a look, he thanks her. Then goes.

               EXT. SPECTRE - MAGIC HOUR

               Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         One day, Edward Bloom left, and never 
                         returned to the town he'd saved.

               He climbs in his car and starts the engine.

               EXT. JENNY HILL'S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT

               As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, 
               swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.

               Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes 
               slither through the marsh.

               Day becomes night.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As for the girl, the common belief 
                         was that she'd become a witch, and 
                         crazy at that. She became something 
                         of a legend herself.

               We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty 
               iron gate with flashlights. A beat, then they run away.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And the story ended where it began.

               INT. JENNY HILL'S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

               Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of 
               iced tea between them.

                                     WILL
                         Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, 
                         because she was old back when he was 
                         young.

                                     JENNY
                         No, it's logical if you think like 
                         your father. See, to him, there's 
                         only two women: your mother and 
                         everyone else.

                                     WILL
                         You didn't become crazy.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, therapy. And one day I realized 
                         I was in love with a man who could 
                         never love me back. I was living in 
                         a fairy tale.

               Will smiles to hear it called that.

                                     JENNY
                         People aren't like they are in 
                         stories. They hurt each other without 
                         meaning to. They are kind and 
                         unbelievably cruel at the same moment. 
                         Like me, now. I'm not sure I should 
                         have told you any of this.

               Her composure is starting to break.

                                     WILL
                         No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I 
                         know.

               A long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is working 
               herself into more of a state by not talking.

                                     JENNY
                         I wanted to meet you for the longest 
                         time. I did.
                              (a smile)
                         I envied you so much. The way Eddie 
                         would talk about you when you were 
                         at Missouri, that award you won. 
                         Congratulations, incidentally. And 
                         when you got the job at the A.P., 
                         everything, he was so proud of you. 
                         I mean, that's the thing. Every moment 
                         he loved you.

               She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over 
               this.

                                     JENNY
                         And as brightly as the sun would 
                         shine when he was with me, every 
                         time he left it disappeared. I wanted 
                         to be as important to him as you 
                         were, and I was never going to be. I 
                         was make-believe and his other life, 
                         you, were real.

               ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

                                     JENNY
                         You knew that, didn't you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately 
               turns it off. He's trying to think.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK

               Will walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to 
               his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK

               It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV. 
               Will sets his keys on the table.

               INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

               Will looks in. Empty.

                                     WILL
                              (calling out)
                         Hello? Mom? Dad?

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK

               We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He 
               aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK

               Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty. 
               The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.

               A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down 
               the stairs.

               INT. FOYER - DUSK

               Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT, 
               where the "MESSAGE" light blinks on the answering machine.

               INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick 
               plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the 
               information desk, so Will forges ahead.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place 
               to start. Then, behind him --

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Will!

               He turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She 
               was calling him.

                                     WILL
                         What happened?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Your father had a stroke. He's 
                         upstairs with your mom and Dr. 
                         Bennett.

                                     WILL
                         Is he going to be okay?

               A beat. How can she answer?

               He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of 
               course his father's not going to be okay.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, will he get back to 
                         the way he was when...

               She cuts him off --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No. He won't. I'm sorry.

               And like that, it's done. We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the 
               news.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose. 
               There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. It's 
               mercifully quiet.

               Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly. She's holding herself 
               together, but it's been a tough day.

               Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third 
               time.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't suppose one of us could stay 
                         with him. In case he...
                              (beat)
                         In case he wakes up, one of us should 
                         be there.

                                     WILL
                         I'll stay. Why don't you go home 
                         with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Dr. Bennett)
                         That's okay?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's fine.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Will)
                         You'll call if...

                                     WILL
                         I will. I'll call.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, do you want some time with Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes. Thank you.

               A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine 
               as they leave. Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.

               She neatens his hair. Holds his hand. As she kisses his 
               fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sandra waits outside the women's restroom. Her face is a 
               study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable 
               but refusing to surrender to it.

               Josephine emerges.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm sorry. It seems every hour I 
                         have to...

                                     SANDRA
                         I know. It was the same when I was 
                         carrying Will. Like clockwork.

               The two women start to walk, no hurry.

                                     SANDRA
                         Do you like it, being pregnant?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I do.

                                     SANDRA
                         I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but 
                         I loved every minute of it. I did. 
                         Eddie was travelling a lot, so he 
                         was gone, but I felt like I always 
                         had a piece of him with me. A little 
                         part of his soul inside me. I could 
                         feel it. It was alive and kicking.

               Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. She 
               struggles to keep it in check. Almost a whisper...

                                     SANDRA
                         I really miss that.

               With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on. Hold back.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Don't stop. Don't.

               A beat, then Sandra finally melts. Josephine holds her. The 
               two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment 
               be.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the 
               crossword puzzle. A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his 
               overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Glad to see you're not trying to 
                         have a heartfelt talk. It's one of 
                         my greatest annoyances, when people 
                         talk to those who can't hear them.

                                     WILL
                         My father and I have an advantage. 
                         We never talk.

               Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart.

                                     WILL
                         How long have you known my father?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Thirty years. Maybe more.

                                     WILL
                         How would you describe him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                              (re: chart)
                         Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated 
                         hypertension.
                              (beat)
                         How would his son describe him?

               Tables turned, Will searches for an answer. He doesn't have 
               one.

               Dr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Did your father ever tell you about 
                         the day you were born?

                                     WILL
                         A thousand times. He caught an 
                         uncatchable fish.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not that one. The real story. Did he 
                         ever tell you that?

                                     WILL
                              (suddenly interested)
                         No.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Your mother came in about three in 
                         the afternoon. Her neighbor drove 
                         her, on account of your father was 
                         on business in Wichita. You were 
                         born a week early, but there were no 
                         complications. It was a perfect 
                         delivery. Now, your father was sorry 
                         to miss it, but it wasn't the custom 
                         for the men to be in the room for 
                         deliveries then, so I can't see as 
                         it would have been much different 
                         had he been there. And that's the 
                         real story of how you were born.

               A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors 
               being paged.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not very exciting, is it? And I 
                         suppose if I had to choose between 
                         the true version and an elaborate 
                         one involving a fish and a wedding 
                         ring, I might choose the fancy 
                         version. But that's just me.

               Will half-smiles.

               Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will 
               and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and 
               starts making a list.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS

               Will flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer.

               He smiles, remembering something. On his fourth page, he 
               looks up at his motionless father. A beat, then we slowly

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

               It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is 
               glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, 
               Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, 
               the pen in his hand.

               He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What 
               woke him up?

               He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath.

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes 
               are open, scared and confused.

                                     WILL
                         Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?

               Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his 
               finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push 
               it.

                                     WILL
                         What can I do? Can I help? Can I get 
                         you something? Water?

               Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the 
               nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward 
               won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         The river.

                                     WILL
                         The river?

               It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought. 
               It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this 
               world.

                                     EDWARD
                         Tell me how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         How what happens?

                                     EDWARD
                         How I go.

               ON WILL, realizing...

                                     WILL
                         You mean what you saw in The Eye?

               Edward nods. Yes, that's what he was trying to say.

               A long beat.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know that story, Dad. You 
                         never told me that one.

               Will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and 
               holds it. There's nothing else to do.

               Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He 
               sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's 
               coming. Without the story, he's lost.

               Fighting the urge to panic --

                                     WILL
                         I can try, Dad. If you help. Just 
                         tell me how it starts.

                                     EDWARD
                         Like this.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. Okay.

               Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. He looks 
               to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it.

               ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. It's morning, and you and I 
                         are in the hospital. I'd fallen asleep 
                         in the chair. I wake up and I see 
                         you, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [STORY VERSION]

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               It's dawn, and the first golden glow is shining through the 
               vertical blinds.

                                     WILL
                              (louder and concerned)
                         Dad?

               We LOOK OVER to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed, 
               combing his hair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Let's get out of here.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Somehow, you're better. Different. 
                         You're getting ready to go. And I 
                         say...

                                     WILL
                         Dad, you're in no condition to...

               But Edward throws back the covers.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a fold-up wheelchair in the 
                         bathroom. Wrap a blanket around me. 
                         As soon as we get off this floor, 
                         we'll be in the clear.

               Will heads for the bathroom. Sure enough, the wheelchair is 
               there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hurry! We don't have much time.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward 
               points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Faster!

               They pass a HEAVYSET NURSE, who turns to look.

               Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will! I... What are you doing?

               Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair 
               himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with 
               him.

               The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room.

                                     NURSE
                         Security! Stop them!

               DOWN THE HALL

               At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will 
               and Edward barreling straight at them.

                                     EDWARD
                         No time to explain! Follow us!

               Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking 
               Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.

               INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

               Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly 
               crashes into the back wall as the doors close.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the 
               Chevrolet.

               AT THE CAR

               Will lifts his father out of the chair.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         I pick you up and you hardly weigh 
                         anything. I can't explain it.

               Will sets him in the passenger seat.

                                     EDWARD
                         Water. I need water.

               Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead. Hands 
               it off. Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, 
               he douses himself. Soaks the blanket.

               Will pops the trunk. Starts to fold up the wheelchair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Leave it! We won't need it.

               TIRES SMOKE as the car peals out.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [REALITY]

               TIGHT ON Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks.

                                     WILL
                         And we have to take Glenville to 
                         avoid all the church traffic, because 
                         those damn church people drive too 
                         slow.

               TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail. He's focused completely 
               on Will's story.

                                     WILL
                         I ask...

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT. GLENVILLE BLVD. - DAY [STORY VERSION]

               The Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic.

                                     WILL (O.S.)
                         Where are we headed?

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         You say...

               INT. CHEVY - DAY

                                     EDWARD
                         The River!

               Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to 
               get around the jam. But it's no use.

               Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive 
               hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.

               Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back.

               EXT. ASHTON RIVER - DAY

               The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of 
               more than 100 waiting.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         As we get closer to the river, we 
                         see everybody's already there. And I 
                         mean everybody.

               Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. 
               Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the 
               Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a 
               day since we saw them last.

               While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, 
               Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.

                                     PING
                         He's here!

               The crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny Hill 
               smiles. So does the Old Woman.

               We PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see...

               YOUNG EDWARD

               reflected. This is what he saw.

               INT. THE CHEVROLET - DAY

               Amazed, Will turns to his father.

                                     WILL
                         It's unbelievable.

                                     EDWARD
                         Story of my life.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. 
               Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl 
               comes just after that.

               Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out. 
               Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.

               Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He 
               hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline. 
               They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

               The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As 
               he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the 
               cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And the strange thing is, there's 
                         not a sad face to be found. Everyone's 
                         just so glad to see you, and send 
                         you off right.

               Will walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so 
               his father can face the crowd. Edward waves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!

                                     THE CROWD (VARIOUS)
                         Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll 
                         miss you!

               But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra. Will turns 
               to see she's already standing in the river beside them.

               The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an 
               unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than 
               we've ever seen her.

                                     EDWARD
                         My girl in the river.

               She kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in 
               approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only 
               Will is there to witness.

               As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. 
               But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free 
               with his teeth.

               A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the 
               ring out of his mouth.

               Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For 
               he's no longer a man, but rather

               A FAT CATFISH

               swimming at his feet.

               We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, 
               disappearing.

               Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching 
               Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back 
               on the shore, along with the entire crowd.

               MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...

               Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, 
               cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. It then dives 
               back under with a SPLASH.

                                                         CROSSFADE BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.

                                     WILL
                         You become what you always were. A 
                         very big fish.
                              (he smiles)
                         And that's the way it happens.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a whisper)
                         Yes. Exactly.

               Edward smiles, proud of both of them. His eyes are so pale 
               and so open, we can almost see his soul. In every atom of 
               his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.

               And this is how he goes.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. The 
               walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.

               He finds a quarter, starts to dial. He has to squint to see 
               through the water in his eyes. It's ringing. And ringing. 
               The other end answers.

                                     WILL
                              (voice cracking)
                         Hi.

               That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him. 
               He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.

               MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.

               INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY

               Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the 
               elevator.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in. She 
               strips the bed.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for Will 
               to wear at the funeral. Will tries to button the cuffs on 
               the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links.

               He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to 
               find a matching pair. Further down, he finds a ribbon tied 
               to

               THE KEY TO THE CITY.

               He smiles, disbelieving. It's a real thing.

               EXT. CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY

               Will helps his mother out of a black sedan. She's well-
               composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.

               Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE. 
               The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than 
               expected.

               As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see 
               an Oldsmobile parking.

               CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.

               The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely 
               visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be 
               70.

               It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.

               The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT 
               UP to see this man is huge.

               This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least 
               six-eight.

               CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.

               EXT. CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY

               As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother 
               to a seat near the grave.

               Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN 
               (50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses 
               peers out -- the woman's twin sister.

               It's PING and JING.

               Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look. 
               From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing 
               steps forward. They're really two separate people. 

               A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: 
               BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]

               After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. 
               By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling 
               stories. They're telling Edward's stories.

               We find Will watching them.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Have you ever heard a joke so many 
                         times you've forgotten why it's funny? 
                         But then you hear it again and 
                         suddenly it's new. You remember why 
                         you loved it in the first place.

               Will joins in, laughing.

               We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the 
               screen.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY [SUMMER]

               Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching 
               his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.

                                     SON
                              (to the other boys)
                         So he said he'd fight the giant who 
                         was fifteen feet tall.

                                     KID
                         No way.

                                     SON
                              (calling over)
                         Dad, that's right, isn't it?

                                     WILL
                         Something like that.

                                     SON
                         See. So he was a giant but my grampa 
                         was going to fight him because he 
                         wasn't afraid of anything because 
                         he'd seen how he was going to die in 
                         this old lady's glass eye...

               Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES. Sandra 
               takes Will's hand in hers, just listening.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         That was my father's final joke I 
                         guess. A man tells his stories so 
                         many times he becomes the stories. 
                         They live on after him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               EXT. RIVER / UNDERWATER - DAY

               A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And in that way, he becomes immortal.

               The fish passes us with a SPLASH.

               CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
BLADE : TRINITY


        Over darkness a WOMAN'S VOICE speaks to us.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     Italo Calvino once said that myth is the
                     hidden part of every story, the buried
                     part, the region that is still unexplored
                     because there are as yet no words to
                     enable us to get there.
                          (beat)
                     But I was there for the end.  I took part
                     in it.  And I think my words can help shed
                     light on what happened.  My name is
                     Abigail.  This is our story.


            FADE IN:


            EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN


            Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of
            rocky desert.  Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an
            ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud
            brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur.


            SUPER TITLE:	SOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE


                                    SIX MONTHS AGO


            AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER


            kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep.  He
            is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a
            religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO.


            Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS.  The sheepherder looks up --


            TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS


            approach from the East.  They touch down near the base of the
            ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.


            FOUR FIGURES


            disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear.  They
            wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the
            teeth.  To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens.


            One of the figures turns to the East.  We can see the rising
            sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of
            a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He
            raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day.


            Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward.
            They mount the central steps of the ziggurat.


            INT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY


            The shrine is empty.  The woman activates a wearable computing
            device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat.


            She kneels, studying the floor.  In the corner of the room she
            identifies a particular brick and presses it.  We hear hidden
            COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up --


            -- revealing a stone stairway leading down.


            INT. ZIGGURAT - STAIRWAY - DAY


            Dark.  Sepulchral.  Spooky.  The figures descend into --


            INT. ZIGGURAT - BURIAL VAULT - DAY


            -- an empty room with an earthen floor.  The sunlight from
            above barely penetrates down here.  One of the figures takes
            out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating --


            -- walls covered with CUNEIFORM WRITING.  The male figure who
            flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset.


                                MALE FIGURE
                     That's great. We've got dick.
                          (turning to the others)
                     Is there any reason we had to embark on
                     this cluster-fuck during the day?


            The woman removes her helmet.  This is DANICA TALOS.  A
            vampire.  Intense, appearing to be in her 30s.  Possessing a
            regal air.  She wears a silver crucifix around her neck.


                                DANICA
                     Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You
                     know that.


            One by one, the others remove their helmets.  All vampires:


            GRIMWOOD (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique
            and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs.


            ASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma.


            WOLFE (30s), quiet and deliberative.  Right now he's readying
            a portable ground-penetrating radar unit.


            Grimwood studies the writing on the walls.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     What is this chicken-scratch?


                                DANICA
                     Cuneiform. Dates back about four
                     thousand years.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     So why here?


                                DANICA
                     Because this was the cradle of
                     civilization.  He would've been
                     comfortable here.


                                ASHER
                     I don't know, Dan.  Seems like another
                     dead-end.


                                WOLFE
                     I'm not so sure --


            Wolfe looks at his unit, excited.  The others gather round.


                                WOLFE
                     There's something beneath us.


            ON WOLFE'S RADAR UNIT


            We see a cross-section image of the soil and subsurface
            features beneath them.  SOMETHING has been buried down there.


                                ASHER
                     Is that a body --?


            Wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit.  The image resolves
            further.  It's definitely a BODY.  Then, we hear the low
            RUMBLING of more hidden counter-weights and --


            A SLAB OF STONE


            slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     What the fuck --?!


            Grimwood pounds his fist against the stone.  It's solid.  He
            tries to find a hand-hold, tries to shoulder it open in some
            way, but the barrier is unmovable.  They're trapped.


                                ASHER
                     Radio back-up.  See if they can open it
                     from the other --


                                WOLFE (0.S.)
                     Guys?


            Wolfe points at the ground.  A tiny depression has formed,
            with sand funneling into it.


            Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole. 
            The grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression
            gradually widening.  Curious, Wolfe leans closer --


            A CLAWED, ARMORED HAND


            suddenly EXPLODES upward from the ground.  It latches onto
            Wolfe's neck.  dragging him down head-first!


            Wolfe THRASHES, his head still buried beneath the sand.  He
            knocks over the lantern, which FLICKERS, shorting out.


            Asher rushes to Wolfe's side.  Then Grimwood.  They grab Wolfe
            by the shoulders, SCREAMING, trying to pull him back.


            Asher is KICKED by Wolfe's thrashing legs.  He flies upward,
            hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned --


            Danica joins Grimwood.  Abruptly, they wrest Wolfe free --
            headless.  BLOOD erupts from the sand.  Then --


            A HELLISH CREATURE


            unearths itself, ROARING.  It's difficult to make out in the
            flickering light.  But what we do see is terrifying.  Spiked,
            demonic armor, clutching a sword.  An elongated, helmeted face
            with a blood-splattered set of hinged fangs -- hinting at an
            inhuman physiognomy within.  The hinged jaws open, coming at
            us.  And just as the lantern goes out for good we --

                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - CORRIDOR - NIGHT


            Danica moves down a modern architectural corridor lined in
            glass and steel.  VAMPIRE SOLDIERS stand ready nearby,
            outfitted in body armor, clutching automatic rifles.


            AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR


            Asher, Grirnwood, and another vampire, HENDRIX are gathered by
            a titanium door outfitted with a biometric security system.


            Danica joins them, studying a VIDEO MONITOR which offers a
            darkened view of the interior of the vault.  We can just make
            out a FIGURE sitting there in the shadows.


                                DANICA
                     What's he been doing?


                                ASHER
                     Nothing.  Just sitting there since we
                     brought him here.


                                HENDRIX
                          (nervously)
                     Do you think we've got enough security?


                                DANICA
                     Hendrix, if he wanted to out of there -
                     there isn't an army in the world that
                     could keep us safe.  We didn't capture
                     him.  He allowed us to take him in.  You
                     understand?
                          (nodding to the door)
                     Now open up.


            The others look at her like she's insane.  Nevertheless,
            Danica places her hand on the biometric scanner.  Hendrix keys
            in a series of commands on a nearby computer console.  The
            vault doors open with a HUM, allowing Danica into --


            AN AIRLOCK-STYLE VESTIBULE


            She steps inside.  The vault closes behind her.  We hear
            BLOWERS as the air is cycled.  A SECOND SET OF DOORS open --


            INT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CELL - NIGHT


            Danica steps into a nearly pitch-black "clean room".  We hear
            BREATHING.  Despite her calm demeanor, she's frightened.


            From the darkness, SOMEONE SPEAKS -- a voice low and rumbling,
            laced with an ominous gravity.


                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     Why have you woken me?


                                DANICA
                     Your people need you, Sire.


            She kneels, bowing her head.


                                VOICE (0.S.)
                          (mocking)
                     "My people".  You think I'm your messiah?
                     Your Savior?


            We hear MOVEMENT.  A pair of RED EYES pierce the gloom -- and
            God help us, even though he remains partially shadowed, this
            guy has to be the scariest mother-fucker we've ever seen.


                                VOICE
                     What makes you think I wanted to be
                     brought back?


            A hand emerges from the darkness, armored.  Danica wants to
            bolt.  Instead, she fights to keep herself from flinching as a
            taloned finger brushes her throat.


                                DANICA
                     Times have changed.  Science has made
                     great strides.  Your blood, the sacrament
                     you provide -- it can set us free now.


                                VOICE
                     I see.  And the one I killed earlier?  He
                     was vampire?
                          (off her nod)
                     You must forgive me.  It had been
                     centuries since I last fed.


                                DANICA
                     I understand.


                                VOICE
                     Then offer yourself to me, child --
                          (lifting her chin)
                     -- and let me quench my thirst again.


            INT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT


            WHOOSH!  The vault doors open and Danica stumbles out, all but
            falling into Asher's arms.  She's bone-white and there are
            fresh BITE MARKS on her throat, BLOOD staining her shirt.


                                ASKER
                     Danica!  Are you alright --?!


            She nods, shaking, struggling to recompose herself.


                                DANICA
                     Let him out -- he wants to see what's
                     become of his world.


                                                                  CUT TO:

                     Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance, forensic
                     psychiatrist and author of the New York
                     Times best seller "Human Health: The Whole

            INT. LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO - NIGHT


            Taping is underway.  Larry King sits at his desk opposite
            EDGAR VANCE (40s), a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic
            demeanor and movie star good looks.  CHIEF MARTIN VREEDE (50s,
            square-jawed), joins via remote feed.


                                LARRY
                     Dr. Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a
                     biochemist, isn't that right?

                     Yes.  I've long believed that in order to
                     achieve true health, we have to reconcile
                     the body and the mind.  Of course that
                     also requires letting go of a lot of our
                     old notions and superstitions, which is
                     what my work is all about.


                                LARRY
                     Let's talk about that.  How do you account
                     for the fascination with things that go
                     bump in the night?  Movies, books,
                     videogames -- seems like we can't get
                     enough of our boogeymen?

                     Monsters provide a means for us to
                     transfer our more primal and darker urges
                     into something external.  In the case of
                     vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues
                     like predatory rage and sexual sadism. 
                     These are scary subjects for people to own
                     up to.


                                LARRY
                     So we pass the buck to someone else?


                                VANCE
                     Exactly.  Historically, people suffering
                     from medical conditions have always been
                     our psychological scapegoats.  In the
                     Middle Ages schizophrenia was often
                     attributed to demonic possession.


                                LARRY
                     And vampires?


                                VANCE
                     Well, there's a hereditary blood disease
                     known as porphyria that has symptoms
                     remarkably similar to the classic vampiric
                     traits.  People suffering from this
                     disease are anemic, they become sensitive
                     to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic --


                                LARRY
                     Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me
                     that's good for the heart.
                          (turning to Chief Vreede)
                     Chief Vreede?  What's your take on all the
                     recent rumors we've been hearing about
                     vampires?


                                VREEDE
                     The only vampires I'm worried about are
                     the ones passing the bar exam.
                          (laughing)
                     Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you
                     think we'd be on to them by now?  The
                     truth is, our streets have never been
                     safer.  Homicides, assaults -- violent
                     crime is down across the board.  If people
                     want to be concerned, they should focus on
                     criminals like Blade.


                                LARRY
                     Now who's this?  Tell me about him.


                                VREEDE
                     He's a sociopath we've been pursuing.


                                VANCE
                     Blade is a very disturbed individual. 
                     Even the name he's chosen for himself is
                     troubling.  According to witnesses, he
                     operates under the belief that a vast
                     conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. 
                     You have to look at the psychiatric
                     underpinnings here.  What does a person
                     like Blade really want? 
                     Odds are, he's really trying to work out
                     some kind of inner trauma.  He thinks he's
                     slaying monsters, but he's really trying
                     to murder aspects of himself.


            The sound of GUNFIRE pre-laps over from the next scene as we --


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. MACHINE SHOP/PARKING LOT - NIGHT


            -- a MASSIVE EXPLOSION ripping through an industrial building. 
            Banks of windows BLOW OUTWARDS, FIRE ROlLS, brick walls
            CRUMBLE, raining debris everywhere.


            A SCREAMING, BURNING MAN


            goes tumbling into the night air.  Buoyed by the explosion,
            his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet.


            MORE MEN (VAMPIRES) race out, some of them on fire.


            CLOSER


            as a FORMIDABLE FIGURE resolves out of the swirling flames. 
            It's Blade, striding towards us in slow-motion, body bristling
            with weapons, the exaggerated sounds of his FOOTFALLS ringing
            out like drums of doom.


            He looks like the God of War.  WHOOSH!  We ramp back up to
            real-time.  Then faster as --


            -- a TRIO OF VAMPIRE LOW-LIFES (STONE, GEDGE, and CAMPBELL)
            run for their lives towards their vehicles.  TWO MODIFIED
            STREET RACING CARS are pulling out; a Mustang and an Eagle
            Talon.  Gedge is climbing into the Talon even as it starts to
            move, pulling the door shut.  At the same time --


            -- Stone and Campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered
            hardtail chopper cycles.  Blade starts forward, drawing two of
            his custom MACH pistols, but --


            --	the Mustang comes SCREAMING IN REVERSE TOWARDS him!


            Blade makes a SUPER-HUMAN LEAP over the speeding car. 
            Momentarily upside down, he FIRES through the windshield and
            engine block as he flips.  Within the car, the vampires ASH.
            The Mustang EXPLODES.  flipping over and --


            --	Blade, now facing frontward again, continues to FIRE as he
            lands, aiming at --


            THE TALON AND THE CHOPPERS,


            which haul ass out of the parking lot, swerving into the
            traffic on the street beyond.


            Blade KEEPS FIRING until he's out of bullets.  Then --


                                ELLINGSON (O.S.)
                     No more bullets, Blade?  Guess it's time
                     for you to fall down and go boom.


            FOUR STRANDED VAMPIRES,


            from the conflagration, their clothes still smoking, surround
            Blade.  Call them EMOND, DOH, DENLINGER, and ELLINGSON.


            Blade holsters his MACH pistols.  Then reaches for a wicked
            looking CHAIN-KNIFE strapped to his thigh.  The knife has a
            button on either side of the hilt.  As Ellingson RUSHES him --


            -- Blade triggers the first button.  ZZZING!  The knife-blade
            ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored
            chain.  The blade penetrates Ellingson's chest.  He GASPS as
            he starts to ASH.  But before his disintegration is complete --


            -- Blade hits the second button.  The knife-blade retracts,
            the razored chain WHIRRING back into the knife-hilt.  Blade
            SPINS, triggers the first button again --


            The knife-blade FLIES OUT, the razored chain whipping around
            Denlinger's throat.  Blade tugs.  The razor chain cuts through
            Denlinoer's neck, decapitates him. As he ASHES --


            -- Blade triggers the knife again.  As it ejects, he whirls it
            over his head, making a sound like a BULL-ROARER.


            Blade drops low, swinging the razored chain.  The chain slices
            through Emond's legs.  Emond's amputated legs ASH, the rest of
            him tumbling onto the asphalt.  He SCREAMS.


            Blade retracts the knife-blade, whirls, THRUSTS it through
            Doh's abdomen. who was coming up from behind.  As Doh ASHES,
            Blade returns to Emond, finishing him off --


            -- and Blade is on the move again, RUSHING after the vampires
            who escaped.


            EXT. STREET - OVERPASS - NIGHT


            The bike-riding vamps cut across traffic, then SCREAM down an
            on-ramp to a busy street below.


            BACK TO BLADE,


            sprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk.  He touches a
            hand to his ear.  We SEE a tiny receiver tucked within.


                                BLADE
                     Whistler!  I'm on the Stonebridge
                     overpass at Clemons --


                                WHISTLER'S VOICE
                     Got it!  Heading eastbound, I'm just
                     beneath you --


            Blade dodges past a HONKING car, stepping onto and over the
            trunk, then leaps atop the safety rail of the overpass as --


            A BIG-RIG CAB


            hauling a semi-trailer THUNDERS beneath the overpass, sounding
            its AIR HORN.  It has safety cables running along the
            perimeter of the trailer roof, like an aircraft carrier.


                                WHISTLER'S VOICE
                     -- GO!!!


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            Blade LAUNCHES HIMSELF into the air.  He lands atop the semi,
            then tumbles, nearly slipping off the edge as he --


            -- snags one of the safety cables atop the trailer!  He
            dangles above the asphalt then SWINGS himself into the open
            back of the trailer.  We HOLD for a beat, then hear the
            THUNDERCLAP of a high-performance ENGINE turning over as --


            BLADE'S MATTE-BLACK DODGE CHARGER


            ROCKETS out of the back of the trailer, sailing right over a
            car that was tail-gating the semi, heading into three lanes of
            on-coming traffic at fifty miles an hour!


            Blade hits the brakes, sending the battle-scarred muscle car
            into a spin, clipping other vehicles in the process.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            As cars continue to brake and COLLIDE around him, Blade puts
            the pedal to the metal once again.  The Charger accelerates,
            tachometer red-lining as Blade pulls alongside the cab of the
            big-rig, catching a glimpse of --


            WHISTLER BEHIND THE WHEEL


            Whistler grins, gives Blade a little salute and --


            --	Blade reaches between the seats, ACTIVATING the newly
            installed nitrous oxide fuel-injection system.


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            Hyper-speed.  The Charger jets forward as the NOS nitrous
            system boosts the car's speed by another 300 HP, leaving any
            and everything in its dust.  In seconds, it has caught up to --


            STONE AND CAMPBELL


            They draw TEC-9s, FIRING back at Blade.  The bullet-proof
            windshield holds as do the kevlar body panels protecting the
            engine -- but the rounds chew the shit out of the bodywork.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Blade gives his car another jolt of nitrous.  The Charger
            SURGES FORWARD as Stone and Campbell fall back, veering to
            either side.  Now Blade is ahead of them.  He checks their
            position in his rear-view mirror, then stands on the brakes --


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            The Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat,
            causing Stone and Campbell to rear-end Blade.


            The vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like
            crash-test dummies.  Stone SMASHES through Blade's back
            windshield, continuing into the front seat--


            -- while Campbell tumbles over Blade's roof and across his
            hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield
            wipers at the last minute.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Blade clutches the wheel.  He's got a HOWLING vampire in the
            front seat, upside down, covered in windshield fragments and
            another perched on his hood, obscuring his vision.


            Stone tries to right himself, clawing at Blade.  Blade
            struggles, keeping one hand on the wheel while he --


            --	reaches for a shotgun secured between the seats.  He
            FIRES.  As the vampire ASHES, Blade hits a button on the dash. 
            The passenger door opens, spills Stone onto the road --


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            -- right into the path of an oncoming bus!  WHAM!  Stone is
            ground to paste and --


            INT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT


            TOURISTS, mostly elderly.  The passengers are jolted in their
            seats as the wheels of the bus KA-THUMP over Stone's remains --


                                OLD WOMAN
                     I hope that wasn't a dog.


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            -- and we're back in Blade's Charger as Campbell continues to
            HAMMER away at the windshield.  The windshield spiderwebs. 
            Campbell manages to get a clawed hand through --


            Blade swings his shotgun over, shoving it in Campbell's
            snarling mouth.  He pulls the trigger --


            BOOM!  Campbell's CINDER-REMAINS blow over the cracked
            windshield.  Blade hits the wipers, spritzes window cleaner -
            but the mess turns to ashen sludge.  making the view worse!


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            The Talor is up ahead, weaving in and out of traffic. 
            Fighting to see, Blade accelerates, gaining ground --


            The VAMPIRE DRIVER leans out of his own wihdow, looking back
            at Blade, FIRING an AUTOMATIC PISTOL --


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Blade's windshield, already weakened by Campbell, SHATTERS,
            blowing glass fragments all over him.  Undaunted, Blade calmly
            reaches for his dash, hitting a button labeled "UV".


            EXT. BUSY STREET/BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            Roof-mounted UV DAYLIGHTS come on, bathing the car ahead and


            (more importantly) the vampire driver with UV LIGHT!


            The vampire at the wheel SHRIEKS, ASHES, leaving the car


            driverless.  Gedge tries to lean over and take the wheel --


            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT


            BURNING REMAINS blow back at us.  Then the view clears and --


            EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT


            --	Blade SLAMS his charger into the Talon.  The cars briefly
            lock, grinding SPARKS.  Then they disengage.  Blade jerks his
            steering wheel, gives the Talon ANOTHER SLAM.


            The Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk,
            PLOWING DOWN newspaper vending machines and table-top displays
            piled with cheap wares, then a phone booth, a food cart. 
            PEDESTRIANS duck for cover and --


            -- the Talon gets some serious air, ROLLING onto its side as
            it comes back to earth.


            EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT


            --WK-KRUNCH-- the wreck skids to a stop against a streetlight.
            The streetlight CREAKS, CRASHES DOWN on the wreck.  BYSTANDERS
            gather, murmuring amongst themselves --


            Gedge drags his bleeding body from the wrecked Talon.  He
            staggers to his feet, clutching a pistol, limps away --


            BLADE'S CHARGER


            pulls up.  Blade climbs out, shotgun in hand.  The shotgun has
            an under-mounted stake launcher.  Blade FIRES at --


            -- Gedge.  The stake hits him in the back.  KNOCKING him onto
            the street.  Bystanders SCREAM, falling back, taking cover --


            Blade approaches, puzzled.  Gedge is still alive, LAUGHING. 
            He looks at Blade, eyes crazed, flashing his fangs.


                                BLADE
                     Staked you with silver.  Why aren't you
                     ash?


            Gedge coughs blood, struggles to speak:


                                GEDGE
                     Why aren't you smarter?  Not a vampire,
                     dumbshit -- set your sorry ass up --


            Gedge tugs at his fangs.  They're fake, PROSTHETIC.  Gedge is
            looking past Blade.  Blade turns, looking up --


            A ROOFTOP ABOVE


            Danica is perched there.  She backs into the shadows.  But
            Blade doesn't have time to investigate because --


            --	POLICE SIRENS are drawing near.  Blade retreats to his
            charger.  He GUNS it, speeding away as we --


            CUT TO:


            EXT. BLADE AND WHISTLER'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Blade's Charger pulls up to a boat house at the water's edge. 
            Blade climbs out, disappears inside.


                                WHISTLER (O.S.)
                     What the fuck happened tonight?


            INT. BLADE AND WHISTLER'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            New digs.  Built into the decaying boat house, retrofitted for
            Blade's combat needs.  Blade is taking off his body armor,
            tossing weapons onto a work table.  He's frustrated.


                                BLADE
                     How should I know?  He was human.


            Whistler reaches for a bottle of whiskey, takes a sip.

                     You've been getting careless, Blade.  You
                     kill a vampire, they ash, don't leave any
                     proof of their existence.  But something
                     like this, a human corpse, it's messy --
                          (shaking his head)
                     -- you better hope nobody IDed you.

            CLOSE ON a TV screen.  We are watching a news feed.  A
            REPORTER interviews a WOMAN at the intersection where Blade
            executed Gedge.  Now the reporter turns to the camera.

                          (on-screen)
                     That was just a taste of the mayhem that
                     occurred during tonight's brazen shoot-out
                     that left at least four people dead.  Now
                     apparently an anonymous citizen captured
                     the whole event on video --


            The IMAGE FREEZES.  We hear the clatter of KEYBOARD KEYS as we
            pan over to an adjacent computer monitor where a series of
            VIDEO CAPTURES of the event flash by us in slide-show mode.


            AGENT RAY CUMBLERLAND studies the screen.  Ray is a career
            agent.  Dedicated and dogged to the point of annoyance,
            utterly humorless.  His office is cramped and institutional,
            devoid of any personal touches.  It's also overflowing with
            files, photographs, and charts concerning Blade and Whistler.


            A BULLETIN BOARD


            features numerous surveillance photos of Blade and Whistler in
            action, along with various news clippings and two WANTED
            POSTERS ("UNLAWFUL FLIGHT TO AVOID PROSECUTION - MURDER,
            AGGRAVATED KIDNAPPING, ARMED VIOLENCE").  Most of the photos
            are blurry and indistinct -- akin to snaps taken of Bigfoot.


                                HALE (O.S.)
                     Ray!  Heard we've got a lead!


            WILSON HALE (20s), Ray's subordinate, rushes in, excited.  Ray
            stands, ripping down a photo of Blade and Whistler.

            on display nearby.  The cover story features a BLURRY PHOTO of
            Blade's recent melee with the vampires.


            Whistler picks up the tabloid, studying it.  Next to the photo
            is an ARTIST'S SKETCH OF BLADE.  The headline reads: "GUN
            TOTING PSYCHOPATH CAPTURED ON FILM!"


            Whistler nods to the CASHIER, hands over some more cash.

                     I'll take this too.

                     You should.  Something like this --
                          (gesturing to the tabloid)
                     -- taking out a human, even one working
                     for the vampires -- far as the rest of the
                     world's concerned, you're public enemy
                     number one.


                                BLADE
                     Didn't realize this was a popularity
                     contest.


            Whistler shakes his head, frustrated.

                     Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's
                     happening?!  The fuckers are finally
                     getting smart.  They're waging a goddamn
                     PR campaign.  Now it's not just vampires
                     we have to worry about, we're gonna have
                     to take on the rest of the world too.
                          (beat, adamant)
                     They've got us on the run.  These last few
                     months we've barely been staying ahead of
                     the curve.


                                BLADE
                     You worry too much, old man.

                     I've been doing this since before you were
                     born, Blade.  The moment you stop
                     worrying, you're dead.


            Then Whistler's face softens for a moment.


                                WHISTLER
                     Since the day I found you, you've been

             EXT. INNER CITY STREET - NIGHT


            It's rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic. 
            PEOPLE mill past on the crowded sidewalk.


            We move from face to face, capturing brief portraits of
            working-class desperation -- an OVERWEIGHT GUY, a PAIR OF
            HOMELESS TEENAGERS, an ASIAN VENDOR, a STREETWALKER.


                                VOICE (O.S)
                     How about that one?


                                SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
                     No fatties.  They taste like Cheetos.

            We hear LAUGHTER and we WHIP-PAN over to a grimy office
            building, ZIPPING UP the face of it to --


            A ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE


            A SKATE-PUNK (SQUID) gets some air, flipping his board up into
            a nice Ollie backside grab, then scoots over to --


            -- THREE MORE PUNKS perched on a concrete ledge, watching the
            people below them.  They are: PROOF, FLICK and DINGO.  All in
            their teens, sporting copious piercings and tattoos.  Flick
            wears a ratty T-shirt from "The Lost Boys" movie.


                                DINGO
                     C'mon, just pick one.


                                PROOF
                     Once you buy a prize, it's yours and
                     yours to keep.


            They keep looking.  Then, Flick suddenly points, excited --


                                FLICK
                     Got it, got it!  Baby on board!


            ANGLE ON A MOUSY WOMAN (ABIGAIL)


            moving below, her figure camouflaged beneath layers of
            clothing.  She's in her 20s, lugging a NEWBORN in a BabyBjorn
            carrier that's strapped to her chest, clutching a bag of
            groceries in either hand.  She looks a little haggard.


            As we watch, she reaches an elevated rail station entrance.


            BACK TO THE SKATE-PUNKS


            Dingo nods and smiles approvingly.


                                DINGO
                     Looks like we got ourselves a combo meal.


            EXT. ELEVATED RAIL STATION - VARIOUS - NIGHT


            A series of shots as Abigail makes her way into the station,


            passing a few other PEOPLE here and there.


            INT. ELEVATED RAIL PLATFORM - NIGHT


            A depressing, dimly lit, partially open-air station.  Abigail
            moves out onto the platform, which is now deserted.  She
            glances around, a bit nervous, and finally sits on a bench.


            Beat.  Just the wind MOANING in the tunnels, across the
            platform.  Then we hear a RUSTLING SOUND --


            Abigail looks right, sees nothing.  We hear ANOTHER SOUND,
            this time from the left --


            Abigail looks up, briefly glimpsing a FIGURE ducking behind a
            concrete pillar.


            Unnerved, she stands, moving a protective hand over her baby. 
            She backs up a few steps, trying to look around the pillar --


            -- but no one is there.  Then a SHADOW MOVES behind her.  She
            SENSES it, spinning --


            -- but again, she seems to be alone.  Thoroughly frightened
            now, Abigail scoops up her grocery bags, turns to exit and --


            -- slams right into Dingo and Proof!  She GASPS.


                                DINGO
                     Hey, pretty lady.


                                PROOF
                     Sophisticated mama.


            Dingo and Proof reveal their fangs.  Abigail SCREAMS, runs --


            -- right into the arms of Flick and Squid!  They grab her,
            RIPPING the BabyBjorn carrier from her chest, SHOVING her back
            at Dingo and Proof.


            In seconds, Dingo and Proof have Abigail on the floor. 
            They're tearing away at her clothing, LAUGHING.


                                DINGO
                     Scream if this hurts, chica!


            ON FLICK,


            removing the BABY from its carrier.  He holds the baby up -
            only it's not a baby.  It's a DOLL with the words "FUCK YOU!"
            written on its chest.  Flick is briefly confused --


            -- and then the baby doll EXPLODES, covering Flick's face with
            a cloud of GARLIC GAS!


            Flick recoils, retching, wiping at his burning face --


                                FLICK
                     --aghhk -- it's fucking garlic!


            ON DINGO AND PROOF,


            looking back, alarmed.  Then Abigail pulls her knee to her
            chest.  A SILVER SPIKE springs out from the toe of her boot.


            She KICKS UP, imbedding the spike up through the underside of
            Proof's chin.  Proof ASHES.


            Before Dingo has a chance to act, Abigail gets him in a
            leglock, FLIPPING him back onto his ass.


            ABIGAIL


            jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat.  Long tresses of
            hair spill around her shoulders.  She's not mousy at all.  In
            fact, she's beautiful.  And cut like an Olympic athlete.  And
            equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons.


            Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH!  Abigail plants her heel in his face,
            SMASHING IN his nose.  She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again.
            Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES.  He goes down as --


            -- Flick and Squid come charging!  Squid gets her in a CHOKE
            HOLD.  She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the
            nuts as he lands.  He curls up, GROANING --


            Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat --


            -- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE
            from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her
            wrist.  She POPs the knife through Squid's chest.  He ASHES --


            FOLLOWING ABIGAIL


            as she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE
            secured to her back.  She holds the crescent in the center,
            the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and --


            CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping
            outward into a three-foot long metal arc.  Connecting the two
            ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER.


            Abigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm.  His arm falls,
            ASHING.  Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward
            through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter --


            Flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his
            trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling
            away to reveal Abigail in the background --


            Dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life.


            Abigail gives her UV arc a twist.  It retracts.  She secures
            it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking
            "bloop" GUN with a large barrel.  She FIRES --


            A rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters
            against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up --


            Dingo goes down again.  He panics, trying to scrape the gunk
            off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the
            hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap.


            Abigail calmly approaches.  She stands over Dingo, staring
            down at him with a look of cruel indifference.  She holsters
            her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE --


                                ABIGAIL
                     Scream if this hurts, chica.


            -- and SLAMS the stake into his chest.


            WIDEN OUT


            Abigail turns, surveying her work.  The ashen remains of the
            vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers.  In
            thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all.


            A train approaches, pulls into the station.  PASSENGERS
            disembark, flood the platform.  They tramp all over the ashes
            of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter.


            Abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. 
            She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - WHISTLER'S ROOM - NIGHT	


            Whistler sits on a cot, contemplating the tarnished wedding
            ring on his hand.  He slowly spins it around his finger.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade sits before a small Buddhist shrine, meditating. 
            Incense burns.  His sword rests in a ceremonial holder.  Near
            silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside.


            CLOSE ON BLADE'S FACE


            We hear the SOUNDS OF VIOLENCE -- ECHOING SCREAMS, GUNSHOTS. 
            These are Blade's thoughts.  The inner demons he is constantly
            trying to tame.  The sounds CRESCENDO and --


            --	Blade opens his eyes.  He listens.  Something is wrong.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Blade creeps into the outer room, sword drawn.


            NOISE behind him, turns to see --


            WHISTLER


            standing in the shadows, clutching a handgun.


                                WHISTLER
                     What is it?


                                BLADE
                     What you've been worrying about.


            They listen.  Just the sound of the ocean swell.  Then --


            A WINDOW SHATTERS


            TWO ARMORED SWAT AGENTS lower in on rappelling lines. 


            TWO MORE AGENTS


            CRASH through a bank of windows on either side, swinging in. 
            They FIRE cannisters of TEAR GAS.  As Blade moves to engage
            them, Whistler RUSHES into the heart of the armory --


            A reinforced door EXPLODES inward.  MORE AGENTS storm inside. 


            FROM THE WATER,


            a military Zodiac (inflatable boat) roars up one of the wooden
            boat ramps, laden with gun-toting AGENTS.  They jump out,
            fanning all over the boat house.


            He hears a


                                AGENT
                     On the floor!  ON THE FLOOR!


            Whistler FIRES at them, then makes a run for it.  The agents
            RETURN FIRE, but Whistler ducks behind a concrete pillar --


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Cop cruisers, unmarked cars, and SWAT trucks sweep in, SIRENS
            blaring, disgorging a small army of POLICE and FBI AGENTS.
            POLICE BOATS are pulling up to the dock.


            AGENTS CUMBERLAND AND HALE


            emerge from an unmarked, wearing bullet-proof vests,
            brandishing firearms.  Cumberland barks orders into a radio.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Lock it down!  Keep them contained!


            On the rooftops above, various SWAT SNIPERS take position.


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Blade BRAWLS with a half-dozen agents, sending them flying in
            all directions.  He grabs one agent, HEAD-BUTTS him, THROWS
            him into the path of two others --


            Then he reaches for another, THROWING him THROUGH a window at
            the rear, out into the river which runs below --


            ON WHISTLER


            as he moves with increased urgency.  The armory is filling up
            with tear gas.  Coughing and half-blind, he hurries to a bank
            of computers, types in a series of commands --


            THE VARIOUS COMPUTER MONITORS


            around him synch up, showing the same protocol message:


                            Data protection routine enabled


                          --	Server 1 protection enabled...


                          --	Server 2 protection enabled...


            In response, a rack of network storage equipment and removable
            hard drives EXPLODES.  Then a second rack of equipment
            EXPLODES as well.


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            From their vantage point below, Cumberland and the others can
            hear the explosions. Cumberland is on his radio, SHOUTING:


                                CUMBERLAN D
                     What's going on in there?


                                AGENT'S VOICE
                          (over radio)
                     Some kind of self-destruct program!
                     They're fragging their hard drives!


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            Whistler keeps moving.  An agent gets a clear shot at him,
            FIRES -- Whistler is hit in the chest.


            Blade SEES Whistler take the hit, but he's cut off from the
            old man, being swarmed by agents --


                                BLADE
                     WHISTLER!


            Whistler staggers, keeps moving.  He makes it to another bank
            of computers, launches the same protocol.


            ON MORE MONITORS


            Erasing information, purging themselves.  We see commands:


                         --	Workstation 1 protection enabled


                         --	Workstation 2 protection enabled


            With each successive command, the workstations themselves
            begin self-destructing, EXPLODING one after another.


            Another agent gets a bead on Whistler, FIRING a round into
            Whistler's thigh.  Whistler SCREAMS --


            ON BLADE,


            in anguish as he sees his mentor being slaughtered.  Then two
            agents are RUSHING HIM, tackling Blade.  As one they fall
            backwards, into another bank of windows --


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            CRASH!  The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of
            glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below.  The
            roof buckles under their weight, windows SHATTERING --


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Take him down!


            An FBI AGENT raises a CODA net gun atop his shoulder, taking
            aim.  BA-BANG!  Four projectiles expand out from the barrel,
            carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them.


            The netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his
            movements.  Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of
            him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission --


            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            On the verge of losing consciousness, Whistler props himself
            against a piece of machinery.  He's bleeding, been shot to
            hell.  One of his hands is closed, clutching something.


            Agents warily close in around him, guns raised.


                                AGENT
                     Move a finger and you're dead.


                                WHISTLER
                          (flipping them off)
                     How 'bout this one?


            Whistler lets his other hand uncurl. He's got a REMOTE in his
            palm, with a tiny digital timer counting-down.


                                AGENT #2
                     He's got something in his--


            00:03.  00:02.  00:01.  The timer reaches zero.


            A SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS


            rock the workshop, knocking the agents back.


            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT


            CLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching
            all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane
            force.  In the midst of the conflagration --


            -- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors --


                                BLADE
                     WHISTLER!!!


            -- but the wall of FIRE and LIGHT is rushing onward, sweeping
            up everything in its path, turning the world to white.


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            FADE IN.  We are CLOSE ON Blade's perspiration-beaded face.
            His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness.


                                CUMBERLAND (O.S.)
                     Rise and shine, sleepyhead.


            PULL BACK.  We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window. 
            Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him, BRIGHT LIGHTS shining
            down on him.  He looks disoriented, battered.  Very weak.


            Cumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade.


                                BLADE
                     Who --?


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson
                     Hale, FBI.  We've been tracking you for a
                     long time.


                                BLADE
                     Whistler --


                                HALE
                     Dead.  Just like all of your victims.


            Blade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     How many people have you killed?  Thirty?
                     Forty?  A hundred?


                                BLADE
                     Those were familiars -- people who worked
                     for them --


                                CUMBERLAND
                     And by "them" you mean vampires, right?
                     I suppose next you'll be telling us that
                     Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So
                     what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy? 
                     Maybe you can give us some pointers.
                          (counting on his ringers)
                     You can stake 'em, right?  Then there's
                     sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson? 
                     Do those still work?


                                HALE
                     I don't know, Ray.  What if a vampire's
                     Jewish?


                                CUMBERLAND
                     That's a good point.  And does garlic work
                     on a Hindu vampire?  Or do you need
                     saffron or something?


            Hale laughs.  Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     You can keep doing your song and dance as
                     long as you want, Blade, but it's not
                     going to play.  You're a stone-cold
                     killer.  And you're sick as fuck.


                                VANCE (O.S.)
                     Let's leave the diagnosis to the
                     professionals.


            ANGLE ON DR. EDGAR VANCE,


            standing in the doorway.  He's the man we saw on Larry King.
            He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table.


                                VANCE
                     Hello, Blade.  My name is Doctor Vance.
                     I'm with the Department of Mental Health.
                     I've been charged with conducting a
                     psychiatric evaluation of you.
                          (to Cumberland and Hale)
                     Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few
                     moments alone?


            Cumberland nods.  They rise, exiting the room.  Vance smiles,
            trying to project a sympathetic air.


                                VANCE
                     I imagine this must be very frightening
                     for you.  But I want you to know that I'm
                     here to help.  In order to do that,
                     however, I need to ask you some questions.
                          (beat)
                     Now.  Can you tell me what day it is?


            Blade just stares daggers at Vance.


                                VANCE
                     What about the President?  Do you know
                     who's in the White House at the moment?


                                BLADE
                     An ass-hole.


                                VANCE
                          (sighing)
                     Alright then, let's talk about vampires --
                     what can you tell me about that?


            INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT


            On the other side of the mirror, Cumberland and Hale have
            joined Chief Vreede.  We hear Blade and Vance via speakers:


                                BLADE
                     There's nothing to tell.  They exist.


                                VANCE
                     And are you one of them?


            INT.	POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Vance sits forward, drawing closer.


                                VANCE
                     What about blood?   When you drink it, do
                     you find yourself sexually aroused?


            Blade just glares at Vance.


                                VANCE
                     You see, it strikes me that this business
                     of vampirism has strong connotations of
                     sexual confusion.  Bodily fluids being
                     exchanged, that sort of thing.  You have
                     to ask where that comes from.  I'm
                     wondering, for instance, what your
                     relationship was like with your mother.
                     Were the two of you close?


            Blade glares.  If he escapes, he's going to kill this guy.


            INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Dr. Vance steps into the observation room, joining Chief
            Vreede, Cumberland, and Hale.


                                VREEDE
                     What's your assessment, Doctor?


                                VANCE
                     He's psychotic, with paranoid features,
                     possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy. 
                     He's exhibiting disorganized behavior.  He
                     obviously doesn't have a properly formed
                     conscience --
                          (spreading his hands)
                     For his safety and the public's, I'm
                     recommending that he be transferred to
                     County Psychiatric for further treatment.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     That's unacceptable.  This man's wanted in
                     connection with a laundry list of federal
                     crimes.  I need him on a plane to the
                     Detention Center in Washington tonight.


                                VANCE
                     Agent Cumberland, that man is in no
                     condition to undergo prosecution.


            Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief.


                                HALE
                     Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant
                     here that clearly supersedes --


                                VREEDE
                     I don't care about your warrant.  We're in
                     my jurisdiction now.  You've got an issue
                     with that, you take it up with the local
                     magistrate.


            Dr. Vance shrugs as if to say he's sorry.


                                VANCE
                     I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has
                     already been made.  A team from the
                     hospital should be here momentarily to
                     oversee the transfer.


            INT. POLICE STATION - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT


            Asher, Danica, and Grimwood enter, followed by FOUR VAMPIRES
            dressed as orderlies.  The orderlies carry a straightjacket,
            various restraints, and a collapsible transport gurney.


            Danica approaches the DESK SERGEANT, flashing a hospital ID.


                                DANICA
                     Hi.  We're here to transfer a patient to
                     County General?


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Vance enters once more.  He opens the leather case on the
            table, removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid.


                                VANCE
                          (speaking softly now)
                     Just a little something to keep you
                     compliant.  The normal dose is two, maybe
                     three hundred milligrams.  But for a
                     strapping young hybrid like yourself --


            Vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule.


                                VANCE
                     -- I think we'll kick it up to a couple
                     thousand.


            Vance reaches for Blade's arm.  Blade struggles, tries to pull
            back, but Vance manages to inject him nonetheless.


                                VANCE
                     There.  That wasn't so bad, was it?
                          (smiling)
                     You're weak, aren't you?  In need of your
                     serum.  Who would've guessed a mere human
                     like myself could overpower you?


                                BLADE
                          (realizing)
                     You're with them -- a familiar --


                                VANCE
                     Going on five years now.


            Vance extends his arm, pulling back his shirt cuff a little to
            reveal a VAMPIRE GLYPH tattooed on the underside of his wrist. 
            Then he pulls his cuff back down, smiles at Blade.


                                VANCE
                     It's the end-game, Blade.  All their plans
                     are finally coming to fruition.  So just
                     sit back and enjoy the show.


            Blade looks to the one-way mirror, SCREAMS.


                                BLADE
                     He's one of them!  Damnit, he's working
                     for them!


            Vance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to
            say -- "The man's deranged.  What can I do?"


            INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT


            On the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging
            lunatic.  Vance enters.  He extends his hand to Vreede.


            They shake.  As they do so, we SEE a vampire GLYPH on the
            inside of Vreede's wrist as well.  Another familiar.


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror.  He blinks,
            trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in.


            INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            An elevator door opens.  Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit,
            followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney.  As
            they move down the corridor, they pass --


            -- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede.


                                CUMBERLAND
                     Just hold it right there --


            Danica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him.


            Cumberland looks to Hale.  Something isn't right about this.


            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now.


            BLADE'S POV


            His vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving
            trails as he shifts his head from side to side and --


            ASHER, DANICA, AND GRIMWOOD


            enter, followed by two of the orderlies.  Despite his
            incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise.  Danica plants her
            heel in his chest, shoving him back down.


                                DANICA
                     Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere.


            She draws closer, enjoying herself.


                                DANICA
                     We moved the humans around like, pawns,
                     Blade.  Used them to flush you out.


            Blade tries to LUNGE from his chair at her and -- WHACK!
            Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw.  A brutal blow.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Don't worry, Captain Sunshine.  Soon as we
                     get you out of here, you'll get a chance
                     to play.


            Danica motions to the two vampire orderlies.  They step
            forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade. 
            Blade THRASHES madly.  Asher LAUGHS, enjoying this.


                                DANICA
                     Don't make this any harder than it has to
                     be.  You're all alone, Blade.  No one can
                     help you now.


            BA-BOOM!  The one-way mirror SHATTERS, exploding outward in a
            shower of SLOW-MOTION GLASS FRAGMENTS, carrying with it --


            -- a BODY, one of the vampire mental health flunkies --


            ASHING in mid-air as he sails into the room!  Seconds later --


            A MAN


            VAULTS through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing
            two high-tech electronic pistols.
            Meet HANNIBAL KING (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an
            irrepressible grin.  Slapped to his chest is a "Hello, my name
            is" sticker with the words "FUCK YOU" written where the name
            should be.


                                KING
                     Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death?


            Danica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly --


                                KING
                     He kept biting his own lip.


                                DANICA
                     King!


            The lights go out.  Immediately, backup lights come on,
            followed by FIRE ALARMS.  In the ensuing confusion ~ both
            pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire
            orderlies behind him to take the hit.


            THE VAMPIRE ORDERLY ASHES


            But unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside
            out.  (The reason is King's signature bullets -- SUN DOGS,
            explosive rounds that give off concentrated UV light.)


            King whips around, FIRING at --


            -- Danica, who LEAPS behind the table.  She quickly upends it,
            using it as a shield, FLINGING it at King.


            ON BLADE


            He shifts his weight, throwing himself and the chair he's
            sitting on to the floor.  Then he KICKS OUT AND UP --


            -- connecting with Grimwood's mid-section, sending him FLYING
            BACKWARDS -- straight through the wall into the next room!


            King holsters one of his pistols and hauls Blade up.  At the
            same time, he FIRES on Asher again, missing him --


                                KING
                     Let's FLY, kemosabe!


            King drags Blade to the door --


            INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            -- into the neighboring corridor.  Cumberland and Hale SEE
            them.  They reach for their weapons --


                                CUMBERLAND
                     He's getting away!


            King FIRES into the room behind him, then pulls a GRENADE
            secured to a bandolier and tosses it through the doorway --


            An EXPLOSION rocks the interrogation room, filling the
            corridor with smoke, knocking Cumberland and Hale back.


            King turns his attention to Blade's handcuffs, FIRING between
            them, freeing Blade's hands.  Blade collapses against the
            wall.  He's shaking, close to passing out.


                                KING
                     Don't die on me, you undead motherfucker!


            King drags Blade up.  They continue down the corridor to --


            ABIGAIL, THE FEMALE VAMPIRE HUNTER


            we met earlier.  She's engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a
            half-dozen UNIFORMED OFFICERS.  Three of them are already
            down.  In seconds, she finishes off the other three.


                                KING
                     Whistler!  We need that serum NOW!


            Whistler?  Abigail spins, dispatching the last officer with a
            kick to the mid-section while tossing a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR at
            King.  He snatches it, places it in Blade's hands.


            Blade injects himself in the neck.  Moments later, he's
            reenergized.  He looks to King, clear-eyed.


                                KING
                     Hey Blacula, you ready to shake and bake?


            Blade responds by PUNCHING King across the jaw.


                                BLADE
                     Call me that again and I'll give you
                     fucking brain damage.


            King massages his jaw, tossing Blade a pistol even as --


            --	Grimwood rounds the corner, hungry for blood, TWO MORE
            VAMPIRE ORDERLIES behind him.


            Blade FIRES round after round of EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, causing
            Grimwood and the others to fall back.  Blade and King move,
            joining Abigail.  MORE SMOKE, darkness, only the emergency
            lights to illuminate the station.


            UP AHEAD,


            a group of POLICEMEN spill from a stairwell, armed with bullet
            proof vests.  They OPEN FIRE --


            Blade, King, and Abigail retreat into an alcove.  They're
            pinned down between the vampires and a group of policemen.


                                KING
                     We're pinned down!
                          (to Blade)
                     Can't you do something?!


                                BLADE
                     I can't shoot around corners!


                                ABIGAIL
                     I can.


            As King and Blade lay down COVER FIRE, Abigail reaches behind
            her, withdrawing a device that's been secured there.  She
            gives it a SNAP and it springs open, taking the shape of a --


            FUTURISTIC COMPOUND BOW


            Crafted from aluminum, its limbs imbedded in key positions
            with vibration-dampening modules, this bow is capable of
            firing an arrow upwards of 300 feet-per-second.


            Abigail withdraws a SILVER ARROW with a time-delay explosive
            tip from her quiver, nocks it in her bow and takes aim at --


            A FIRE EXTINGUISHER


            mounted at the end of the corridor.  She lets her arrow fly --


            MOVING WITH THE ARROW


            as it banks off the side of the fire extinguisher, continuing
            down the side corridor where it embeds itself in --


            -- the shoulder of one of the vampires!  The vampire SCREAMS,
            grabbing the shaft, ripping it out.  Then we --


            MACRO-ZOOM ON THE ARROW HEAD


            A tiny "egg-timer" dial on the arrowhead spins.  It CLICKS in
            place, a RED LED comes on, and --


            --	the arrowhead EXPLODES, catching all three vampires with
            the full force of a UV BLAST.  Grimwood ducks away from the
            blast as the other two vampires ASH --


            BLADE, KING, AND ABIGAIL


            come racing out of the alcove.  They reach a stairwell.  Blade
            RIPS a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the
            stairwell at a phalanx of COP REINFORCEMENTS who are charging
            up the stairs.  The cops go down like ten-pins.


            Blade and company have an opening.  But as they charge
            downward --


                                BLADE
                          (as King and Abigail
                          freeze)
                     My sword.  They still have it.


                                KING
                          (apoplectic)
                     Are you insane?!  We're practically home
                     free!  We can't go hunting for your
                     fucking butter-knife now!


            But Blade is already heading back the way they came and --


                                KING
                     Hey!  HEY!!!  COME BACK HERE!!!  This is
                     supposed to be a rescue!


            -- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Forget it, King.  Let's move.


            POLICE STATION - NIGHT


            King and Abigail rush outside.  The station is gated. FLASHING
            POLICE CARS are surging through the mouth of the gate. 
            They're trapped.  Then --


            CRASH!


            A window on the third floor of the station EXPLODES OUTWARD. 
            Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in
            a cat-like crouch.  With his sword in his hand.  He looks at
            King, grins, flips him off.


                                BLADE
                     Now we can go.


                                KING
                          (nudging Abigail)
                     Is he epic or what?


            The police close in around them, pinning the trio down with
            FIREPOWER.  Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because --


            HEADLIGHTS


            are washing over them.  A beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is
            SCREAMING up the street.  The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk,
            SMASHES right through the gated wall.  SCREECHES to a stop
            between our trio and the police cars.


            A DRIVER (DEX)


            leans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors
            pop open.  Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter.


                                DEX
                     My name is Dex.  And I'll be saving your
                     ass this evening.


            Blade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land
            Cruiser.  Dex reverses, backing out the way he came.


            The police from the squad cars are FIRING, but the Land
            Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly SPARK off.


            INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            In the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield --


            ABIGAIL'S POV


            Grimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land
            Cruiser.  Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah.


            EXT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in
            her bow.  She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly --


            SHUNKT!  The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye.  He goes down,
            his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background
            as the Land Cruiser speeds away.


            INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            Safe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a
            battle well fought.  Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone.


                                DEX
                     We have him.  We'll be there soon.


                                KING
                          (to Blade)
                     So my entrance back there -- what do you
                     think?  Too flashy?  Right on the money?


            King unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof
            vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs.


                                BLADE
                     Who are you people?


                                KING
                     My name's Hannibal King.  I'm a hunter,
                     like you.
                          (re: Abigail)
                     And this little hellion is Abigail
                     Whistler.


            Abigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him.


                                KING
                     That's right, Blade.  You're not hearing
                     things.  She's Whistler's daughter.  You
                     see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part
                     of Whistler's "contingency plan".


            King reaches into an inner pocket, pulls out a pack of gum. 
            He selects a stick, offers one to Blade.


                                KING
                     Juicyfruit?


            EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT


            The Land Cruiser rockets away, disappearing into the night.


            EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT


            The Land Cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the
            weed-choked ruins of an old amusement park.  We pass by the
            skeletal remains of a roller-coaster, a tilt-a-whirl, the
            vandalized and wood-rotted remnants of a carousel.


            Finally, the Land Cruiser turns towards a motorized loading
            door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside.


            INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT


            As the door grinds closed, the Land Cruiser stops.  King and
            Abigail lead Blade through the darkness.  In the gloom we see
            a half-dozen vehicles in various stages of being retrofitted
            with armored panels and weaponry, etc.  SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
            mounted above track their progress.


                                BLADE
                     I thought the vampires murdered
                     Whistler's family.


                                ABIGAIL
                     They did.  I'm the product of an earlier
                     fling of my Dad's, born out of wedlock. 
                     After the murders happened, he kept me
                     hidden.  He wanted me safe.  Away from all
                     of this --
                          (gesturing around them)
                     -- but I guess hunting just runs in our
                     blood.


            As King and Abigail lead Blade towards a stairway, Blade
            catches sight of --


            A LITTLE GIRL (5)


            peering down at him from atop one of the rafters.  As soon as
            he spots her, she ducks into the shadows.


            They reach the stairway.  AUTOMATED GUNS mounted on swivel
            arms lock on them with infra-red targeting beams.


                                ABIGAIL
                     When I came of age, I tracked my Dad
                     down, told him I wanted in.
                          (beat, shrugging)
                     Been doing it ever since.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            We enter a sprawling industrial facility that is equal parts
            mechanics shop, firing range, and laboratory.  We glimpse a
            virtual arsenal of new weaponry and medical equipment,
            including DNA sequencers, microfuges, and electroporaters.


            The new equipment fights for space alongside the old -
            mountains of mothballed parts from the park's broken thrill
            rides.  Here and there we see the oversized fiberglass head of
            a grinning fun-house creature or the mildewed torso of a
            fortune-telling mannequin, frozen in its upended booth.


                                KING
                     Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.


                                BLADE
                          (looking around)
                     How do you bankroll this place?


                                KING
                     Internet porn.  See, we're using cock
                     suckers to pay for the blood-suckers.  
                          (off Blade's look)
                     Joke.  Come on, man.  This isn't some
                     piddly little hoopty-ass operation, Blade. 
                     We take our jobs very seriously.


            UP AHEAD,


            TWO OTHERS pause in their work as King approaches.  Dex falls
            in behind them.


            HEDGES (20s) is an engineer, always lost in his own world.


            SOMMERFIELD (30s) is a frail-looking geneticist.  She's also
            blind, operating her computers via a voice-synthesis program
            and Braille keyboard.


                                KING
                     You met Dex.  This is Hedges, Sommerfield--


            King gestures to them in turn.  They're all refugees in one
            way or another, sharing a common guardedness, their lives
            having been shattered by the vampires.


                                KING
                          (nodding back)
                     The runt you saw earlier is Sommerfield's
                     daughter, Zoe.  We call ourselves the
                     Nightstalkers.


                                BLADE
                     You sound like rejects from a Saturday
                     morning cartoon.


                                KING
                     We were gonna call ourselves the Super
                     Friends, but that was taken.


            Abigail rids herself of her weapons -- bow, arrows, silver
            stakes and knives.  She hands her compound bow to Hedges.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Tiller needs adjustment.


                                HEDGES
                     I'll run it through the bow press.


            Blade examines some of the equipment being developed.


                                BLADE
                     How many of you are there total?


                                KING
                     Enough.  We operate in sleeper cells. 
                     When one goes down, a new cell activates
                     to pick up the slack.  Consider us your
                     reinforcements.


                                BLADE
                     Sorry.  Never been much of a team player.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     I don't think you understand, Blade.
                     Whistler meant for us to help you.  When
                     he died, he activated an emergency
                     protocol.  All his knowledge --


            She gestures to the computer equipment around her.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     --was transferred to our servers here.


                                BLADE
                     And what makes you think you know so much
                     about killing vampires?


            King reaches for his collar, pulling it down to reveal a
            telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a BITE MARK.


                                KING
                     Well for starters, I used to be one.  
                          (in a sinister tone)
                     Do I pass the audition?


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - NIGHT


            We soar through the night sky, diving down towards a cluster
            of gleaming, high-tech spires.  As we isolate a penthouse
            apartment atop one of them we hear an ANGRY SCREAM.


                                DANICA (O.S.)
                     Fucking Hannibal King!


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            An impressively decorated loft bespeaking of money, power, and
            a certain perverse esthetic.  Danica slams her fist straight
            through the wall, then spins around, enraged.


            Asher and Grimwood are there too, their wounds being treated
            by Hendrix and a VAMPIRE TECHNICIAN.  At tie moment, they're
            trying to remove the arrow protruding from Grimwood's eye.


            An enormous ROTTWEILER sits nearby, attentively watching. A
            TRIO OF GUARDS flinch with every act of violence. Danica is
            strong.  Clearly, no one wants to get in her way.


                                DANICA
                     I should've ripped his ripped his
                     bleeding heart out when I had the chance!
                          (pointing at Asher)
                     And don't you dare tell me "I told you
                     so"!


            Asher raises his hands as if to say "no harm, no foul". 
            Danica continues her tantrum, SMASHING a statue apart,
            SHATTERING a heavy glass tabletop.  Finally, she gives it a
            rest, collapsing into a chair, shoulders sagging.


                                ASHER
                     You through remodeling?


                                DANICA
                     Blow me.


                                ASHER
                     Face it, Dan.  We got caught with our
                     pants down.  We underestimated the
                     Nightstalkers.


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Pants down?!  They practically fucking
                     ass-raped us!


            Grimwood GRUNTS in pain as the arrow is removed.  Asher
            broaches a more serious subject.


                                ASHER
                     Has he been told yet?


                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     About your failure?


            A MAN (30s) enters the room.  The same being we glimpsed in
            the vault.  He has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence.
            We will learn who he is momentarily.  But for now, it's enough
            to know that everyone in the room pays him deference.


                                MAN
                     Yes, I've been told.


            He places a hand on Danica's shoulder.  She tenses.


                                MAN
                     Perhaps it's time I entered the fray.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON King buttoning his collar back up.  Blade, Abigail,
            and Sommerfield are gathered around him.


                                KING
                     You know the kind of woman that just
                     screams trouble? You see her and every
                     warning bell in your brain starts going
                     off but you still ask for her number? 
                     Well that's all I ever hook up with.  But
                     this betty blew 'em all away in the
                     shitstorm sweepstakes.


            King reaches out to a keyboard, calling up a piece of
            surveillance footage on a nearby monitor.  The footage
            features Asher and Danica and Grimwood.  It's been slowed to a
            near standstill and now advances frame by frame.


                                KING
                     Her name's Danica Talos.  You met her
                     earlier.  The man on her left is Asher,
                     her brother.


            King types a command.  The image ZOOMS IN, tracking Grimwood.


                                KING
                     The neanderthal behind them is Jarko
                     Grimwood.


            King freezes the footage on Danica's grainy, pixelated face.


                                KING
                     I picked Danica up in a bar, had a one
                     night stand with her -- then spent the
                     next five years playing step-and-fetch-it
                     as her little vampire cabana boy.
                          (beat)
                     Eventually Abigail found me.  Sommerfield
                     here managed to treat me with a cure.  Now
                     I kill them.
                          (beat)
                     That's called turning a frown upside
                     down.


                                ABIGAIL
                     We need to pool our resources, Blade.


                                BLADE
                     Why?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Because He's come back.


            King tosses a TOMB OF DRACULA comic book over to Blade.  Blade
            glances at the cover, then looks at them, incredulous.


                                BLADE
                     You gotta be kidding me.


                                KING
                     He's real, Blade.  Dig beneath all the
                     movies and myths.  All the layers of
                     bullshit that've cluttered our culture for
                     the last five hundred years and eventually
                     you'll strike the truth.


                                BLADE
                          (incredulous)
                     So the movies are true?


                                KING
                          (shaking his head)
                     The movies are just a comforting
                     fairytale compared to the real deal. 
                     There's no happy ending with this guy. 
                     Peter Cushing isn't going to run in at the
                     last second and save the day with a cross
                     and some holy water.
                          (re: the comicbook)
                     See, good old Brain Stoker, he wrote a
                     nice yarn.  But the events he described in
                     1897 were only a tiny piece of the mosaic. 
                     The rea1 Dracula's origin goes back much
                     earlier than that.


                                BLADE
                     How early?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Try six or seven thousand years.


            Off Blade's astonished look we --


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. MESOPOTAMIA - NIGHT


            FLASH!  We see the man we met earlier (DRACULA/DRAKE) on the
            banks of the river Euphrates, striding towards us, engaged in
            fierce battle with UBAIDIAN SOLDIERS.  He's clutching the same
            sword we saw in the ziggurat, clad in the same armor.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     Dracula's only one of the names he's gone
                     by.  Now they call him Drake.  If you
                     believe the legends, he was born in
                     ancient Sumeria.


            As Drake SLASHES his sword downward we CUT BACK TO --


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            -- King continuing his story. As the hunter's monologue
            progresses we will INTERCUT with Drake's own progression
            through history.  Brief, violent FLASHBACKS.


            (NOTE:  The backgrounds surrounding Drake will be
            expressionistic, digital composites, constantly shifting.  The
            focus of the flashes is Drake himself, fighting a shadowy
            horde, his attire continually evolving through time.)


                                KING
                     Nobody really knows the specifics of his
                     origin.  But we do know this:  he was the
                     first of his kind.  The patriarch of the
                     hominus nocturna.


            EXT. EGYPTIAN DESERT - NIGHT


            FLASH!  We are in Egypt now, circa 1650 BC.  Drake wages war
            against the HYKSOS.  He is closer to the camera.  And will
            continue to move closer with each successive flashback.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     Every single vampire -- every single
                     monster that's walked the earth since then
                     -- owes their existence to Him.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            Back to King, holding court before Blade and Abigail.


                                KING
                     He's like the Patient Zero of evil.  The
                     original Serpent in the Garden of Eden.
                     And just like the Great White shark, he's
                     never had to evolve.  This guy was born
                     perfect.  Scour the history books --


            EXT. THRACE - NIGHT


            FLASH!  The Peloponnesian War, Southern Thrace, circa 405 BC.
            We see Dracula battling ATHENIANS.  Even closer now, his face
            spattered with blood.  At the same time, the SOUNDTRACK is
            gradually swelling, expanding in complexity and volume.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- read between the lines --


            EXT. HUNGARIA - NIGHT


            FLASH!  5th century AD, battling the GOTHS.  With every swipe
            of his sword, we WIPE FORWARD into the future.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- you'll find countless references to
                     Him.  Always mentioned, never named.


            EXT. EUROPE - NIGHT


            FLASH!  8th century AD, the reign of Charlemagne.  Battling
            the VIKINGS.  The FLASHBACKS come faster now, assaulting us
            with ever-increasing rapidity.


            Drake continues striding forward while the rest of the world
            evolves around him, centuries whizzing by via computer
            generated time-lapse photography.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     He's been there --


            EXT. VARIOUS - NIGHT


            FLASH!  12th century AD, the time of the Crusades.  The
            violence intensifies.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- moving behind the scenes --


            FLASH!  17th century France, the time of Louis the XIV.  The
            pace becomes breathless.


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- cutting a bloody path through the Ages
                     until suddenly --


            FLASH!  18th century Russia, the time of Peter the Great.  The
            soundtrack is THUNDEROUS.  Drake has become a bloody blur of
            bestial rage and unfettered horror and --


                                KING (V.0.)
                     -- just like that --


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            -- King SNAPS his fingers.  We are back in the present.


                                KING
                     -- he up and disappeared.  About a century
                     ago the trail went cold.  Then we heard a
                     rumor.  The vampires were searching for
                     him -- trying to find the place where he'd
                     retreated.  According to our information,
                     they found him in Iraq about six months
                     ago.
                          (beat)
                     And he was pissed.


            EXT. DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT


            Grime.  Neon.  Near-silence as the cacophonous soundtrack
            recedes into the background, replaced by the steady drone of
            inner-city TRAFFIC.


            ON DRAKE,


            viewed through a long-lens, clad in modern, casual attire,
            striding in SLOW-MOTION down a PEDESTRIAN-CHOKED sidewalk.


            Slower.  A HEARTBEAT.  The pulse of the people.  And over
            this, intruding, the Doppler effect WAILING of an approaching
            car as it rushes past us in a SCREEN WIPE until we are --


            OUTSIDE A GOTH STORE


            Drake studies a window display.  Halloween merchandise. 
            Costumes and monster masks and -- VAMPIRE NOVELTIES.  We see
            vampire lunchboxes, Dracula plush dolls, plastic fangs, key
            chains.  Even Dracula bobbleheads.


            Drake stands in stark contrast to the mass-marketed caricature
            on display before him.


            INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT


            Drake enters. The store is crowded with low-end junky goods
            that might appeal to tourists visiting Hollywood Boulevard.


            A pallid, Goth-guy CASHIER sits behind a counter, eating from
            a takeout container.  He's wafer thin, with a detached
            attitude.  A snot.  Further back is a sultry GOTH VIXEN.


            Behind them, on a TV, a cartoon is playing. An animated
            vampire cavorts -- "LITTLE BIT" (like the Hot Stuff devil from
            Ritchie Rich comicbooks)


                                DRAKE
                     In the window -- you sell vampire
                     merchandise?


            Goth Guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin.  Doesn't
            want to engage with Drake at all.


                                GOTH GUY
                     Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a
                     few things.


            He and the Goth Vixen have a snicker at Drake's expense.  Then
            she tries to be a little more helpful.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     We've got Dracula lunchboxes.  Did you
                     see those?  And there're bobbleheads, Pez
                     dispensers.  We've got just about
                     anything --
                          (selecting a vampire-
                          shaped vibrator, playful)
                     -- even vampire vibrators.


            As Drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending
            rage.  Costumes, candles, vampire Christmas ornaments. 
            Posters from different films -- Nosferatu, Lugosi, Lee -- then
            Love at First Bite and The Little Vampire.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     Here, check this out --


            She reaches into a case, pulling out a soft-drink.  The label
            reads: "DRA-COLA" and has a stylized vampire on it.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     "Dracola".  Makes you want to cry,
                     doesn't it?


            Drake just stares at the can.  His mind seems to have
            retreated elsewhere.  Back through the ages.


                                GOTH VIXEN
                     Was there something special you needed?


            Drake doesn't respond.  A kind of melancholy has settled over
            him.  He's an outsider now.  The world has moved on.


                                GOTH-GUY
                     Hey, guy, she's talking to you.


            Drake looks up as Goth Guy pours a bowl of Count Chocula.


            EXT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT


            CRASH!  Goth Guy comes flying through the display window, his
            trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into
            the display window of the store opposite us.


            INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT


            Goth Vixen SCREAMS.  Drake LASHES out.  hauling her over the
            counter.  He sinks his teeth into her throat, drinking her
            blood with wild abandon.  He consumes it so quickly that his
            skin flushes BRIGHT RED.


            Then Drake tears his head away, lifting his face upward as he
            flings the girl aside, unleashing an ear-splitting ROAR.  And
            for a brief moment, the bones of his face seem to shift, once
            again hinting at another shape Drake might take.


            EXT. THE CITY - VARIOUS


            DRAKE's ROAR echoes through the canyons of downtown.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT/DAY


            Time-lapse.  The sun rises over the decrepit amusement park.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAWN
            Sunlight slices down through skylights, bathing Blade, King,
            Abigail, and Sommerfield in its warmth.  Zoe has joined them. 
            She's still cautious and shy, but she's also curious.


                                BLADE
                     Why wake up Drake now?


                                ABIGAIL
                     That's what we've been trying to figure
                     out.


                                KING
                     When I was under the fang there used to be
                     talk about some kind of vampire 'Final
                     Solution'.  But I could never figure out
                     why they'd want to destroy their food
                     source.  I mean, seems stupid, right? 
                     They've always had plans for the human
                     race.  Seems likely that whatever they're
                     cooking up, Drake's return is a part of
                     it.


            Blade nods, pensive.


                                KING (CONT'D)
                     Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a
                     losing battle. 
                     So we kill a few hundred of them a year. 
                     Big deal.  There are thousands of them out
                     there.  Maybe tens of th'usands.  We need
                     a new tactic.


                                BLADE
                     Like what?


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     A biological weapon.


            Sommerfield moves to her Braille keyboard, types.


            ON A NEARBY MONITOR


            we SEE a real-time magnified view of a virus replicating.


                                SOMMERFIELD (CONT' D)
                     For the last year I've been~working with
                     synthesized DNA in order to create an
                     artificial virus targeted specifically at
                     vampires.  We're calling it DayStar.


                                KING
                     Think about it, Blade.  We could wipe
                     them all out in a single move.


                                BLADE
                     So what's been holding you back?


                                SOMMERFIELD
                          (sighing)
                     We've tried it on a number of captive
                     subjects.  We've got the disease vector
                     worked out fine -- it's easily
                     transmittable.  But the lethality in
                     vampires is still spotty.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Bottom line is, we need a better DNA
                     sample to work with.
                          (beat)
                     We need Dracula's blood.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Vampire DNA is a hodge-podge of different
                     genes, mixed in with all sorts of useless
                     junk DNA.  Because Dracula's the
                     progenitor of the vampire race, his DNA is
                     still pure.  It hasn't been diluted by a
                     hundred generations of selective mutation. 
                     It still has all the necessary cellular
                     compounds for the virus to code to.  We
                     get his blood, we can boost Daystar's
                     viral efficacy to a hundred percent.


                                KING
                     So.  You want to join our club?  Can we
                     sign you up for a Nightstalkers secret
                     decoder ring?


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DAY


            Establishing.  The Sun at it's zenith


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - DAY


            A darkened room, relatively austere.  The only source of light
            are a series of small, slitted skylights in the ceiling above. 
            From these skylights, narrow, blinding white shafts of
            sunlight knife downward to penetrate the gloom.


            DRAKE


            sits in a chair, his body partially illuminated by one of the
            sunlight shafts, his face turned upward into its brilliance.


            FOOTSTEPS.  Drake opens his eyes, SEES Danica hovering in the
            darkness, just on the edge of a shaft of light.


                                DRAKE
                     This world sickens me.  The humans have
                     soiled it with their filth.


                                DANICA
                     We can raze their cities to the ground.
                     We can bring the old world back.


            Drake just stares at her, not convinced.


                                DRAKE
                     Come closer.


                                DANICA
                          (re: light)
                     I can't.


                                DRAKE
                     And do you know why?
                          (off Danica's silence)
                     Once, all of my kind could brave the day. 
                     We were true predators.  The world was
                     ours.  And then, somewhere along the way,
                     the purity of our bloodline became
                     diluted.  Polluted with human DNA.


                                DANICA
                     That's impossible --


                                DRAKE
                     Is it?


            Drake stands, drawing close to Danica.  He grips her wrist --


                                DRAKE
                     You are bastard children.  No longer as
                     pure as you pride yourselves on being.


            -- and pulls her hand towards one of the sunlight shafts.  To
            her credit, Danica keeps staring at Drake.  She'll be damned
            if she will give him the satisfaction of seeing her break.


            Drake pulls her hand closer to the light -- to the very edge. 
            And the tips of Danica's fingers begin to burn.  She winces,
            clearly in agony --


            -- and Drake releases her hand.  She cradles it against her
            chest, blinking away tears that have welled up in her eyes.


                                DRAKE
                     My people.  How far you have fallen.


            Drake reaches out, brushes a tear from Danica's cheek, then
            turns and walks away -- through the alternating shafts of
            sunlight and darkness.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAY


            Blade, King, and Abigail stand before a table where an
            assortment of weaponry and ammunition has been laid out on
            display.  Hedges is there too, assisting them.  Zoe watches.


                                HEDGES
                     We've got a wide assortment of ass-
                     kickery for your viewing pleasure --
                          (hefting a pistol)
                     Electronic pistol.  Comes with a built-in
                     fingerprint security system.  Fires a
                     three-shot burst in 1/500th of a second.
                     Bullets can also be triggered remotely.


            King tosses Blade a bullet.  He studies it -- it's more
            complex than a standard round.


                                BLADE
                     Explosive rounds?


                                KING
                     But with a concentrated burst of UV light
                     instead of your standard hollow-points.  I
                     call 'em sun dogs.
                          (to Hedges)
                     Hedges -- super-size me, baby!


            Hedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms.  On the
            stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette.

                     this puppy will pump out.
                          (gesturing to Blade's
                          sword, sarcastic)
                     Of course it doesn't have the range of a
                     sword but --


            Next, Hedges shows Blade the CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE that
            Abigail used.  He gives the device a twist and --


                                HEDGES
                     We call this the UV arc --


            CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping
            outward.  Connecting the tips is a concentrated UV LASER.


                                HEDGES
                     You hold the arc in the center, curved
                     away from you.  Connecting the tips is a
                     powerful UV laser beam.  Because of its
                     high focus, the laser cuts through vampire
                     flesh like a knife through butter.


                                KING
                     We're still trying to sort out fact from
                     fiction when it comes to Dracula.  Turning
                     into mist?  Kinda doubt it.  But general
                     shape-shifting?  Maybe.


                                HEDGES
                          (off Blade's look)
                     Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like
                     that.  But another human, someone with the
                     same approximate body mass -- given enough
                     practice it might be possible.


                                BLADE
                     How?


                                HEDGES
                     He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal
                     structure.  Probably something more like a
                     snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the
                     place of a normal array.  Commensurate
                     with this would be an exquisite control of
                     electrical potential across his tissues,
                     resulting in an ability to effectively
                     change shape at will --


                                KING
                          (raising his hand)
                     Question.  Have you ever been laid,
                     Hedges?


            CUT TO:


            INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - DAY


            Blade, King, and Abigail, newly suited up for war, moving
            towards the Land Cruiser.


                                BLADE
                     Time to apply some pressure.  The weak
                     link in the vampire chain of command has
                     always been their familiars.  Vampires
                     can't go out in the day, so they get
                     humans to do their dirty work for them
                     Blood-running, safe house maintenance,
                     whatever --
                          (climbing in the Cruiser)
                     We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll
                     lead us to the real thing.


            Blade starts the ENGINE.


            INT. LAND CRUISER - DAY


            Blade looks to Abigail, who sits in the back.  She has a
            laptop on her knees and is assembling an MP3 playlist.


                                KING
                     She's making playlists.  Likes to listen
                     to MP3s when she hunts.  Her own internal
                     soundtrack, you know?  Dark-core, trip
                     hop, whatever kids these days are
                     listening to.  Me?   I'm more of a Kenny G
                     fan.


            Finished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on
            her portable MP3 player.  MUSIC CUE.  The smoking bassline of
            Jurassic 5's 'A Day At The Races' kicks in as --


            EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY


            -- Blade, King, and Abigail cruise the streets in a jagged
            fast-forward montage.


            EXT. SEEDY BAR - DAY


            The Land Cruiser jumps the curb, SCREECHING to a stop in front
            of a scuzzy bar.  Amidst a wall covered with graffiti and
            flyers we see a vampire glyph.


            INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY


            BANG!  Blade KICKS open the door.  A couple of LOW-LIFES take
            notice.  Blade moves around the bar, opening a refrigerator -
            we see packs of REFRIGERATED BLOOD inside.


            One of the low-lifes takes off running, back past the
            bathroom, shouldering a door at the rear --


            EXT. SEEDY BAR - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY


            --	STUMBLING right into Abigail's arms.  She trips him up,
            swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him.  She pulls the
            back of his collar down, sees a VAMPIRE GLYPH --


            We can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing,
            raising his hands in a "please don't hit me anymore" manner.


            EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY


            The Land Cruiser rockets down the streets.


            EXT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSES - VARIOUS - DAY


            In quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives --


            -- a pool hall --


            -- an internet cafe --


            -- an electronics repair shop --


            All are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms
            with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where
            the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested.


            In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to
            oldfashioned strong-arm tactics:


            -- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar.


            -- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw.


            -- Abigail KICKS a familiar in the stomach.


            Cut to a flurry of EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of VAMPIRE GLYPHS being
            exposed on the backs of familiar's necks, one after another --


            THEN A MONTAGE OF FACES


            as familiars have their heads cainfully SMASHED against --


            -- walls --


            -- car hoods --


            -- pool tables --


            -- into windows and doors and garbage cans.


            The bullying moves come faster, the shots becoming more and


            more abstract until --


            EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - DAY


            -- WHAM!  Blade tosses HOOP, a skinny familiar, off a roof. 
            It's a four story drop.  Hoop falls, SCREAMING -- but then
            jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down.


            We see now that Hoop has rope tied around one of Hoop's
            ankles.  And Blade is clutching the other end of the rope.


            Blade hauls Hoop back up -- but still keeps him dangling
            upside down.  King and Abigail look on.


                                BLADE
                     Want another spin, ass-hole?  Eventually,
                     your head's gonna pop off.


                                HOOP
                     Shit!  Oh Jesus, please, please --


                                BLADE
                     Who's your handler?


                                HOOP
                     I don't know his name, I swear I --


            Blade prepares to drop Hoop again --


            -- but a CELL PHONE in Hoop's jacket RINGS.  Blade fishes it
            out.  The screen reads:  EDGAR VANCE, 555-5631.


            EXT. CITY STREET - DAY


            Dr. Vance, the psychiatrist who gave Blade the mental
            evaluation, is cruising in his Pacific Blue XKB convertible
            Jaguar.  He's wearing sunglasses, talking on his cell phone.


                                VANCE
                     This is Dr. Vance.  Did someone page me?


            EXT.  CITY ROOFTOP - DAY


            Blade ends the call, then looks to Hoop, smiling cruelly.


            Blade lets Hoop drop.  The familiar PLUNGES four stories,
            SCREAMING.  Lands dead-center in a Goodwill box below.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING - DAY


            A high-tech office complex surrounded by meticulously-groomed
            grounds.  A sign with a swanky "VANCE INSTITUTE" logo zooms.


            Blade, King, and Abigail approach, taking note of Vance's
            Jaguar (complete with vanity plate), parked in front.


                                KING
                     Hey, Blade -- why didn't the vampire bite
                     Mick Jagger?
                          (off Blade's look)
                     Cause you can't get blood from a Stone.


            As Blade walks off --


                                KING (CONT'D)
                     Hey, they can't all be gems!


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING - LOBBY - DAY


            The trio enter, drawing stares from a number of PATIENTS
            gathered in a reception area.  Nearby is a large display with
            Vance's grinning face.  Beneath it, text reads:


                                  EDGAR VANCE, M.D.


                      PRESIDENT, VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING


            Nearby is a bank of monitors showing a snazzy video featuring
            a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG COUPLE marvelling at a sunrise.


                                NARRATOR
                          (on monitors)
                     Regain control of your life.   Wake to a
                     new dawn.  At the Vance Institute for
                     Whole Being we believe in an integrated
                     approach to human health.


            The image cuts to Vance himself, poised on the edge of his
            desk, smiling.  As Blade and company move through the
            institute, the video plays counterpoint to their progress.


                                VANCE
                     I'm Dr. Vance.  Welcome to our facility.
                     As a member of the medical profession I
                     want to assure you that I will do
                     everything in my power ro provide you with
                     the care and compassion that you deserve.


            Past the RECEPTION DESK are the elevators with more monitors
            showing the video greeting.  As Blade, King, and Abigail
            approach, TWO SECURITY GUARDS move to intercept them.


                                SECURITY GUARD
                     Excuse me, can I help y--


            CRACK!  Blade effortlessly tosses the guards aside, sending
            them CRASHING into the nearest monitors.


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


            The trio continue.  A DOCTOR steps out of a doorway.  King
            PUNCHES him in the face.  We see another video monitor.


                                VANCE
                     What does it mean to be human?  Since the
                     dawn of creation our ancestors have asked
                     ourselves that question.


            They round the corner --


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - SECOND HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


            -- nearly colliding with TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS.  Blade
            takes them both out.  There's another video monitor.


                                VANCE
                     The modern world today is filled with
                     countless challenges.  In every direction
                     we look, toxic stressors are impacting
                     upon our happiness.  We think we're
                     healthy, but the truth is, our immune
                     systems are engaged in a life or death
                     struggle to maintain our well being.


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS


            Blade, King, and Abigail storm in.  An EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT is
            moving to stop them.


                                EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT
                     I'm sorry but you can't --


            Abigail KICKS out the man's knee, then slices her hand into
            his windpipe, silencing him.


                                VANCE
                     Now, I'd like to take a moment to exolain
                     how a series of remarkable new
                     breakthroughs can immeasurably improve the
                     quality of your life


            Blade aims his shotgun at the door leading to Vance's office.
            He FIRES at the keycard lock, KICKS down the door --


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY


            --	startling Dr. Vance himself, who is rising up from behind
            his desk.  Vance is wiping his mouth, not dressed like a
            doctor would normally be.  But we hardly notice this as --


                                VANCE
                     What --?


                                BLADE
                     Payback, Vance.


            --	Blade aims his shotgun at Vance's head.  Vance just
            smiles, seemingly unconcerned as --


            --	Abigail circles around the other side, getting a view
            behind Vance's desk where --


            VANCE'S BODY


            lies on the floor.  His throat has been ripped out.  And this
            body is dressed like a doctor.


            King puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even
            as we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE coming from beneath
            the Vance double's flesh --


                                KING
                     Jesus, it's him!  It's Drake!


            The Vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of
            Blade's shotgun aside, re-directing the BLAST, which SHATTERS
            a glass window.  Then he KICKS Blade in the chest, KNOCKING
            him clear across the office as --


            --	King advances.  The Vance double's face WARPS, the bones
            in his head shifting around.  He reaches for King, SLAMS him
            onto the desk, TWISTS the stake from King's hand and brutally
            SHOVING it into King's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top.


            Then the Vance double whirls around to engage Abigail -- only
            we see that it's Drake now, having taken Vance's shape.


            DRAKE


            BACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow.


            She spins, falling --


            -- and Drake is moving like a hurricane, LEAPING through the
            window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast.


            BLADE


            gives chase.  He looks out the window, SEES Drake landing on
            the ground, some three stories below.


            EXT. VANCE INSTITUTE - REAR ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY


            Drake runs with inhuman speed.  He effortlessly scales a chain
            link fence, then BARRELS straight through a wooden barricade,
            sailing over a trash dumpster.  Seconds later, Blade follows,
            catching sight of Drake rushing out into --


            EXT. STREET MARKET - VARIOUS - DAY


            -- a crowded urban market.  What unfolds is a foot-chase at
            super-human velocity.  Vampire and hunter are moving at least
            twenty miles an hour, BATTERING ASIDE various pedestrians,
            SMASHING through and over stalls of merchandise.


            EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY


            Drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes
            of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST.


            Abruptly, Drake cuts into the traffic, LEAPING atop the hood
            of an oncoming car.  The car's HORN sounds, brakes SQUEAL.


                                BLADE FOLLOWS,
                     jumping onto the hood of another car. More
                     HORNS sound.


            In this manner. Drake and Blade race across the flowing
            traffic itself. using the hoods and roofs of the cars like
            moving stepping stones.


            ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET


            Drake mounts the steps of an older apartment building,
            THUNDERS his way through the main entrance --


            INT. OLDER BUILDING - STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - DAY


            Blade is on Drake like a shadow.  We're internal now, the
            sound of Blade's LABORED BREATH moving to the foreground of
            the soundscape.


            Chaos.  A BARKING DOG darting from a doorway.  Up ahead, an
            OLD MAN has been knocked over.  An insane dash up two flights
            of stairs, then down a corridor, passing MORE TENANTS. 
            Somewhere, a WOMAN SCREAMS.  We hear GLASS BREAKING and --


                                WOMAN
                     My baby


            -- there's another open door --


            INT. OLDER BUILDING - APARTMENT - DAY


            -- Blade tears into an apartment, passing a HYSTERICAL WOMAN,
            an upended crib.  He SEES a broken window by a fire escape --


            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - DAY


            Cut onto the fire escape.  A glimpse of Drake overhead.


            Blade clambers up the fire escape, moving in a near-blur.  One
            story of steps up the rickety metal ladder --


            SMASH!  A LARGE PLANTER comes down from above, nearly striking
            Blade.  He lets go with one hand, swings outward --


            -- then he's climbing again.  A CLOUD OF PIGEONS take wing,
            flapping frenetically about him, momentarily blinding him.


            Another story, a third, a fourth.  As he reaches the top,
            Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him --


            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY


            -- FLIPPING himself over and onto the roof.  He lands in a cat
            stance, drawing his sword, quickly scanning the area.


                                DRAKE (O.S.)
                     So you're the hunter they all fear.


            Blade spins --


            DRAKE


            stands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an INFANT in his
            arms.  In the full glare of the afternoon sun.


                                DRAKE
                          (re: infant)
                     Just so we understand each other,
                     Daywalker.


            With his free hand, he massages his jaw.  We hear a few more
            Pieces of POPPING CARTKAGE as the very last of Drake's
            cermanent features seem to settee into clace.


                                BLADE
                     Why did you kill Vance?


                                DRAKE
                     He'd outlived his purpose.  He'd become a
                     liabi1ity.


            Drake nods at Blade's sword --


                                DRAKE
                     Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before. 
                     Eight or nine centuries ago.  The hunter
                     who carried it was an accomplished
                     fighter.


            EXT. SEASIDE CLIFF - DAY (THE PAST)


            Drake in his armor, head to head with a 14th century VAMPIRE
            HUNTER.  The hunter has BLADE'S SWORD.  Drake tears the sword
            from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back
            through the man's chest.  And as the man GASPS we are --


            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY (THE PRESENT)


            -- back to here and now.


                                DRAKE
                     He was honorable, in his own way.  He
                     died a good death.


                                BLADE
                     I wouldn't know about that.


                                DRAKE
                     You lie.  You're part of a grand
                     tradition, Blade.  You hunters have
                     plagued my people since the day we first
                     walked the earth.  And I have vanquished
                     them.  One by one.


            Blade pauses, looking for some kind of opening.


                                BLADE
                     How can you exist in the daylight?


                                DRAKE
                     I've always been able to.  Haven't you
                     read Mr. Stoker's fable?  I was the first
                     of the vampires.  I am unique.


                                BLADE
                          (realizing)
                     That's why they brought you back.


                                DRAKE
                     Yes.  My children seek to isolate the
                     properties in my blood that make me immune
                     to sunlight.  Through me, they believe
                     they can all become Daywalkers.


            Drake glances down at the street people.  Throngs of PEOPLE
            are massing there, pointing up at him.


                                DRAKE
                     The world's changed much since I went to
                     sleep.  How crowded it's become.  Look at
                     them down there.  Lives brief as
                     fireflies.  Do you think they can ever
                     grasp what it means to be immortal like
                     us?


                                BLADE
                     You're not immortal.  I must've heard a
                     hundred of you people make the same claim. 
                     And every one of them's seen the end of my
                     sword.


            Drake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent.


                                DRAKE
                     Perhaps I will as well, then.  But I think
                     it's more likely that you will fall before
                     mine.
                          (beat)
                     Catch.


            Drake tosses the infant at Blade.  Blade twists around to
            catch it, scooping it safely up.  But when he looks back --


            -- Drake is gone.


                                KING (O.S.)
                     Shit!


            INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY


            CLOSE ON King being propped up against the wall by Abigail.
            Blade has joined them.  King is in terrible pain.


                                KING
                     Jesus, it hurts.  I wanna be a vampire
                     again -- fuck!  Did you see that guy?!
                     We're gonna lose, man.  We're gonna
                     fucking lose.


            Abigail ignores King, cuts open his shirt.  She removes a
            small aerosol cannister from her belt.


                                BLADE
                     What's that?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic
                     protein.  Help me spread the wound open.
                     The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in
                     his body cavity from within --


            Together they spread the wound apart.  King is really hurting,
            breathing hard as he tries to fight back the pain.


                                KING
                     Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian
                     vampire say to the other?


                                ABIGAIL
                     Shut up, King.


                                KING
                     -- see you in twenty-eight days --


            King's voice trails off as he passes out.  Abigail triggers
            the dispenser, spraying a jet of compressed foam into it.  The
            foam condenses, sealing the wound up.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - DAY


            Blade and Abigail enter the HQ, hauling King between them. 
            Dex and Hedges rush to meet them, relieving them of King.


            Exhausted and covered in blood, Abigail retires to her
            quarters, stripping off her clothes.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOWERS - DAY


            Abigail stands beneath (he showerhead, turning her face up
            into the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from her body.


            CLOSE ON the drain by her feet, BLOOD swirling down it.  


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY - DAY


            King drowses on a cot.  His shirt is off and his chest has
            been bandaged.  He opens his eyes, SEES Blade above him.


                                KING
                     Hey, Blade -- say we're successful.  Say
                     we wipe the vampires out.  What happens
                     then?  You ever ask yourself that?
                          (weakly)
                     Somehow I don't picture you parked on a
                     porch with a jigsaw puzzle.


            King drifts back into unconsciousness again, leaving Blade
            left to ponder his words.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - DAY


            Later, Sommerfield and Hedges consult with Blade and Abigail.


                                HEDGES
                     So basically we're in an arms race.
                     They're using Drake's DNA to build
                     themselves a better vampire --


                                BLADE
                          (noddin)
                     -- and we need his blood to kill them.
                          (to Sommerfield)
                     How's this weapon of yours coming along?


                                SODDERFIELD
                     We're almost there --


            She gestures to a series of ampule-like prototypes.  (We'll
            see the completed version of this device later on.)


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     The virus is harmless to humans.  So we
                     decided to go after the vampires' food
                     source.  The one thing we know for sure
                     about vampires is that they have to drink
                     blood. 
                     If we manage to pull this off, we'll be
                     able to contaminate every blood source on
                     the planet.  They won't have anyone left
                     to feed on.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Doesn't do us any good if we don't have
                     time to finish it.  We can't just sit
                     here.  We need to take the battle to them.


            Sommerfield lowers her head, thinking.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     If the vampires are trying to isolate the
                     hereditary factor in Drake that makes him
                     immune to sunlight, they'll require
                     certain kinds of laboratory equipment and
                     provisions.  For instance, there's an
                     enzyme called Taq Polymerase.  And there
                     are only a limited number of suppliers.
                          (beat)
                     Give me a few hours.  I'll see if I can't
                     hunt us up some leads.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            Moving towards the mirrored windows we hear LABORED BREATHING.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON hands clasped together -- a man and a woman's.


            CLOSE ON Danica' s face, covered in sweat, in the throes of
            passion.  She looks up, eyes glazed --


            PULL BACK to reveal Drake, propped above her, thrusting away.
            Danica has her limbs wrapped around Drake, holding on for dear
            life.  Both are awash in moonlight.


            The two of them climax.  Drake withdraws, studying Danica. 
            She's naked but for the tiny silver crucifix she wears around
            her neck.  Drake nudges the crucifix with his finger.


                                DRAKE
                     Why do you wear that -- symbol?


                                DANICA
                          (defensive)
                     Old habits --


            She sits up, draping a sheet over her.


                                DANICA
                     I was a good Catholic school girl	Once.


            Drake nods, his thoughts distant.


                                DRAKE
                     I was there when they crucified him.  He
                     died -- for their sins, not mine.


                                DANICA
                          (playful1y)
                     And what are your sins?  Would you care
                     to confess them?


                                DRAKE
                          (shaking his head)
                     Too numerous to remember.
                          (nodding at the crucifix)
                     Take it off.


                                DANICA
                     Why?


                                DRAKE
                     I'll make you a better one.


            Drake draws her in, biting her gently on the neck, sinking his
            fangs into her flesh.  He pulls his head back.  Two rivulets
            of BLOOD trickle from the fresh wounds.


                                DRAKE
                     There's an old saying --


            Drake reaches for the sheet, pulling it away from Danica's
            chest.  Then he dips his fingertips into her flowing blood -
            PAINTING a long streak of it down between her breasts.


                                DRAKE
                     Kill one man, you're a murderer. Kill a
                     million, a king.
                          (smiling)
                     Kill them all, a God.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON a pneumatic injector.  PULL BACK to reveal Blade
            injecting himself with his serum.  No pain.  No violent spasms
            like before.  Blade's body now accepts the serum.


            ANGLE ON ZOE,


            crouched on an old piece of carny equipment, watching him.


                                ZOE
                     Why do you do that?


                                BLADE
                     There's something bad inside of me.  This
                     keeps it from getting out.


            Zee considers this.


                                ZOE
                     Why can't you just be nice?



                                BLADE
                     Good question.


                                SOMMERFIELD (0.S.)
                     I think I've got a lead.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - NGHT


            Sommerfield stands at her computers, reading a tactile Braille
            display.  Blade and Abigail are nearby.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Biomedica Enterprises.  They've been
                     buying up all sorts of supplies -- Taq
                     polymerase, bone marrow growth supplement,
                     genetic sequencing enzymes.


                                BLADE
                     We'll check it out.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            EXT. BIOMEDICA ENTERPRISES - NIGHT


            A high-tech research park.


            INT. BIOMEDICA ENTERPRISES - LAB - NIGHT


            Hendrix, the vampire doctor we saw earlier, sits at a computer
            workstation.  Chief Vreede confers with him.  We hear a KNOCK
            at the door.  Hendrix looks to Vreede.  They obviously weren't
            expecting anyone.


            Hendrix moves to the door, checking a surveillance monitor. 
            He can't see anyone outside.  He shrugs, turns to leave and --


            CRUNCH!  The door is SMASHED inward, taking much of the door
            frame with it, flattening Hendrix.


            Blade and Abigail step inside.  As Blade hauls Hendrix up from
            the ground, Abigail points her already drawn gun at --


            CHIEF VREEDE


            He was reaching into his jacket for his own piece, now thinks
            better of it.


                                BLADE
                     Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?


            Blade nods to Abigail.  She reaches onto Vreede's jacket to
            disarm him.  Blade grips Hendrix by the shirt collar.


                                BLADE
                     C'mere.  We need to talk.


            Blade PUNCHES Hendrix in the face.  Hendrix sags for a moment,
            stunned.


                                BLADE
                     Now spill it, bite-boy.


                                HENDRIX
                          (wiping a bloody nose)
                     You know what we're doing.  Drake has come
                     back to us.  Soon we'll all be Daywalkers.
                     And when that day comes, the world will
                     truly be ours.


            Blade nods towards the back of the lab where another door -- a
            very secure one -- is located.


                                BLADE
                     What's back there?


            Hendrix shoots a quick look to Vreede.  Then he turns on
            Blade, all fangs and claws, trying to tear Blade's eyes out --


            Abigail FIRES her UV gun with blinding speed and --


            -- Hendrix is dead before he knows it.  ASHING all over Blade.


            Blade brushes Hendrix' s remains from coat collar, shoots
            Abigail a look:  "Did you really have to do that?"


                                BLADE
                          (dryly)
                     Thanks.


            Abigail cringes.  Mea culpa.


            Blade looks to the floor.  Aside from some cinders, all that
            remains of Hendrix are his glasses and a singed keycard. 
            Blade picks up the keycard, looks to Vreede.


                                BLADE
                     What's behind Door Number One?


                                VREEDE
                     They'll kill me --


                                BLADE
                          (an evil grin)
                     So will I.  But I'll enjoy it more.


            Vreede nods.  They move towards the door.  Blade slides the
            security card.  An inset light changes from RED to GREEN. 
            Vreede punches in a numeric code.  The doors slide open --


            INT. BLOOD FARMING FACILITY - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT


            Blade, Abigail, and Vreede emerge into a cavernous room.


                                ABIGAIL
                     God in Heaven --


            HUNDREDS OF HUMAN CADAVERS


            hang from gantries, preserved in fluid-filled pods, suspended
            by wires like nightmarish marionettes.  The bodies are hooked
            up to an elaborate system of biosensor feeds and IVs which are
            designed to replenish vital nutrients.


                                BLADE
                     What was this place?


            Vreede pauses before answering, looking uncomfortable.


                                VREEDE
                     It's a blood farming facility.
                          (elaborating)
                     They decided that hunting humans on a
                     piece-meal basis was too inefficient. 
                     Why kill your prey when you can keep them
                     alive?  Productive.  Under optimal
                     conditions a donor can generate anywhere
                     from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a
                     year.


                                ABIGAIL
                          (sickened)
                     But where did you get all these people?


                                VREEDE
                     The streets.  In any given year you've got
                     two to three million homeless people
                     wandering around America --
                          (shrugging)
                     No one cares about them.  We're doing the
                     country a service, really.


            Blade shakes his head, admiring the horrible efficiency.


                                BLADE
                     The vampire Final Solution.


            Abigail moves towards one of the pods, touching her hand to
            the glass, studyihg the comatose person within.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Are they aware?  Do they feel anything?


                                VREEDE
                          (shaking his head)
                     They're in a chemical-induced coma.
                     They're brain-dead, vegetables.


            Blade angrily SLAMS Vreede's face against one of the pods.


                                BLADE
                     Look at this!  Is this the future you
                     want?  You think there's a place for you
                     in their world?


            Vreede starts crying, blubbering.


                                VREEDE
                     We don't have a choice!  They're going to
                     win, don't you see that?!  He's come back!
                     There's nothing stopping them now!


            Blade pulls Vreede back so they're nose to nose --


                                BLADE
                     There's me.


            -- and Blade releases Vreede.


                                BLADE
                     Go.  You've got thirty seconds.


            Vreede turns and runs, stumbling towards the door.  Despite
            his promise, Blade lifts his MACH.  Without even looking in
            Vreede's direction, Blade FIRES.  We hear Vreede drop.


            Blade turns to Abigail.  She can hardly contain herself.
            Nearby is a control console.  Blade UNLOADS his MACH pistol
            into it, damaging the interlinked life support systems.


            One by one, the vital signs and EKGs on the pods flat-line,
            their warning tones rising into a collective, PIERCING WAIL.


                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                          (feeling a heavy weight)
                     Let's go.


            Blade and Abigail leave, turning the lights out as they go.


                                                                  CUT TO:

            A basketball hoop has been set up in the back area and Dex and
            Hedges are engaged in a wicked game of one-on-one.

            At the same time, Sommerfield is reading aloud to Zoe, who
            sits nearby.  The book is The Emerald City of Oz and it's in
            Braille.  Sommerfield scans with her fingers.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     'The reason most people are bad is because

            ANGLE ON A BANK OF SURVEILLANCE MONITORS


            We see Whistler approaching through the garage.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            The steel door slides open and Whistler enters.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY AREA - NIGHT


            King drowses on a cot.  He hears a NOISE, opens his eyes.
            Whistler stands in the doorway.


                                KING
                     You get me those Fruit Roll-ups like I

                          (surprised)
                     Dude.  Aren't you dead?


            Whistler doesn't respond.  King tries to sit up -- but
            Whistler places his hand on King's mouth, shoving him down,
            starting to smother him.  King struggles, confused.


            INT. NGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            Dex manages to steal the ball from Hedges, makes a shot. 
            Behind them, Whistler enters the makeshift court.


    130     INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - NIGHT130


            Abruptly, the sounds of the one-on-one game stop.  We hear a
            THUD from the back of the warehouse -- like someone falling.

            Sommerfield looks to the storage area.  The silence is
            unnerving.  She turns off her voice-synthesis program.  Then
            closes the book.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Guys?  You okay --?


            ON THE DOORWAY


            The basketball comes bouncing out.  It rolls, coming to rest
            against a workbench.  There are BLOOD SPATTERS on the ball.


            Sommefrield reaches for her cane.  She TAP-TAPS her way to the
            baLl, feels the blood.  Knows what it is.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Zoe, go find some place to hide, sweety.


            Zoe hesitates.  Sommerfield senses it and lashes out with her
            cane, BANGING a rack of equipment, startling the girl.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     Damnit, go!  Get out of here, Zoe!


            The girl scurries away.  Sommerfield TAP-TAPS with her cane,
            moving towards the storage area.  She finds a gun cabinet,
            feels around with her hands, locates an electronic pistol.


            INT. NGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            Sommerfield enters.  Dex and Hedges are sprawled on the floor
            before her, having been slaughtered.  Blood is everywnere. 
            She doesn't see them, of course.  But we do.


            THE CAMERA SHIFTS AROUND,


            revealing Whistler crouched right behind her!


            She's unaware of his presence.  And as we watch, his facial
            features shift.  We hear the sickening sounds of CARTILAGE
            POPPING and we realize that it's Drake, not Whistler.


            With mounting dread, Sommerfield turns towards the sound.  And
            then Drake is upon her, rushing forward with a GROWL.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - NIGHT


            As Sommerfield's AGONIZED SCREAMS echo through the warehouse,
            Zoe rushes into the bathroom, looking for a place to hide. She
            considers the lockers, discounts them.  Then settles on --


            A HEATING GRATE


            near the floor.  It's about fourteen inches wide -- just
            barely big enough for her to squeeze into.


            Zoe kneels, prying the grate off.  Inside, a heating duct
            extends four feet before making a ninety-degree turn upward.
            Zoe climbs into the duct feet first, scooting her body
            backwards.  Then she reaches for the grate, securing it back
            on, sealing herself inside.


            INT. HEATING DUCT - NIGHT


            Zoe waits.  It's cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct. 
            She's managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety
            degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position.


            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)


            Mostly tile floor and a small portion of the open doorway
            leading to the hallway outside.


            She listens, trying to hear past the sound of her own


            BREATHING which has been magnified because of the ducting.


            The screams from the outer rooms have stopped.  Then --


            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)


            A pair of boots appear in the doorway -- Drake.


            Zoe holds her breath.  We HEAR Drake searching the bathroom,
            opening the lockers and bathroom stalls.


                                ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)
                     Drake's boot-clad feet pass by the grate
                     again, closer, tn~s time. They pause for
                     an interminable moment --


            Zoe shuts her eyes.  She can't stand it.  Finally, we hear
            Drake's FOOTSTEPS receding away.  Relieved, Zoe takes in a
            breath and opens her eyes --


            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)


            Drake's face is right there.  pressed up against the other
            side of the grate, staring at her!


            Zoe SCREAMS.  With a ROAR, Drake rips the grate off.  He tries
            to climb inside, but the width of the duct is too narrow to
            accommodate the size of his upper body.


            Instead, he reaches his right arm in, extending his clawed
            hand as far as he possibly can.  Zoe WHIMPERS, trying to
            compress her mass into an even tighter ball --


            ON DRAKE'S HAND,


            having reached the limits of its extension -- his fingertips


            only a few scant inches from Zoe's face.


            Zoe's been allowed a moment's reprieve.  He can't reach her!


            But then we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE.  Of TINY
            BONES shifting beneath Drake's flesh.  Drake's fingers are
            elongating, snake-like Reaching for Zoe's face, rapidly
            closing the space whici1 separates them --


            CUT TO:


            EXT. LUNA PARK/GARAGE - NIGHT


            The real Blade and Abigail are returning.  The sliding garage
            door opens and the Land Cruiser glides inside.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT


            Blade and Abigail enter.  The place is dark.  They know
            instinctively that somethong is wrong.


            Blade tries a nearby light.  The power is out.  They both draw
            their weapons.  Blade turns on a FLASHLIGHT.  They move onto
            the darkness --


            SHADOWS loom everywhere.  It's like a tornado touched down
            inside.  Equipment lies smashed, tables and chairs have been
            overturned.  Sommerfield's lab area has been destroyed.


                                ABIGAIL
                     King --


            Blade and Abigail rush to the infirmary area, but King is gone
            and the place has been trashed.  They move into --


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT


            -- the back area.  They find Dex and Hedges on the floor,
            their bodies bled, desecrated.


                                ABIGAIL
                          (realizing)
                     Zoe -- where's Zoe?


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - VARIOUS - NIGHT


            With increased urgency, Blade and Abigail search the
            headquarters -- the bathroom, the garage, every nook and
            cranny.  With each moment, Abigail becomes more panicked.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Where is she?!


            They can't find her anywhere.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - SHOWER AREA - NIGHT


            Blade and Abigail enter.  A thin stream of BLOOD snakes its
            way across the shower tiles.  Taey follow it, discovering --


            SOMMERFIELD,


            her body propped up mock-crucifixion style in the showers.  On
            the wall nearby, someone has written a message in blood:


                   "IMMORTALITY WILL COME TO SUCH AS ARE FIT FOR IT"


            ON BLADE


            He knows damn well who left him the message.


            As tears streak down Abigail's cheeks, she rushes to
            Sommmerfield's body.  Together, she and Blade get her down.


            Abigail clutches Sommerfield, slowly rocking the body in her
            arms.  Blade puts a hand on her shoulder.


                                BLADE
                     Use it.


            Abigail doesn't respond.  Her whole body is shaking.


                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                          (more firmly)
                     Use it.


            Abigail raises her head, her eyes filled with hatred.  Blade
            doesn't let up.  He's like a drill instructor, galvanizing her
            with his words.


                                BLADE (CONT'D)
                     USE IT!!!


            Abigail lifts her head toward the heavens, letting loose a
            TORTURED SCREAM that erupts from the very pit of her soul.


            CUT TO:


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - NIGHT


            Abigail's SCREAM ECHOES over the moonlit cityscape.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            CLOSE ON King's bloody face.  A dog is licking it.  King
            stirs, his eyes fluttering open --


            KING'S POV


            The rottweiler we saw earlier is slobbering all over him.


            PULL BACK to reveal King on his knees, shirtless, both wrists
            secured behind him in a high-tech pillory.  King tries to
            twist his head away from the dog.  The rottweiler GROWLS.


                                KING
                     Back off, pooch --


            The rottweiler's jaws open, revealing more teeth than any dog
            should probably have.


            Its muzzle splits in two as both sides of the rottweiler
            mandible fold back on either side of its head, disgorging a
            hellish and barbed tongue stalk!  The mutant dog ROARS, ready
            to bite King's face off and --


                                KING
                     Jesus Christ!


            -- Grimwood appears from off-screen, LAUGHING, pulling the
            animal back.  We see Danica and Asher now as well.


                                KING
                     What the fuck?!  WHAT THE FUCK?!?


                                ASHER
                     His name's Beau.  We've been experimenting
                     with porting the vampire gene over into
                     other species.


            As Asher pets the rottweiler, its muzzle closes back up again. 
            It looks up at him, panting happily, tongue lolling.


                                KING
                     You made a goddamn vampire dog?!


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Yeah.  Cool, huh?


                                DANICA
                     Poor little King.  You look so
                     distraught.


            Danica wipes a little blood from the corner of King's mouth. 
            She touches her fingertips to her tongue, tasting his blood.


                                DANICA
                     You're tasting a little bland, lover.  Not
                     getting enough fatty acids in your diet? 
                     Have you tried mackerel?  Lake trout?


                                KING
                     How about you take a sugar-frosted fuck
                     off the end of my dick?


                                DANICA
                     Oh, there'll be time to play doctor later,
                     believe me.  But for now, we need to have
                     a little talk.
                          (beat)
                     Tell us about this bio-weapon you've been
                     building.


                                KING
                     I can tell you two things.  Diddly.  And
                     shit.  And diddly just left the building.


            Grimwood steps forward, throttling King for a moment.


                                GRINWOOD
                     Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!


                                KING
                     Okay, here's the deal with the weapon -
                     (coughing)
                     It's a new flavor crystal formula.  Twice
                     the chocolaty-goodness, half the calories.
                     Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay --


            Grimwood moves in to choke him again, but Danica intervenes.


                                DANICA
                     You're brave, King, I'll give you that.
                     But underneath all your swagger --


            She leans closer, caressing his face.


                                DANICA
                     -- I know what you really fear.   What
                     would hurt you more than anything else.


            King's smile falters for a moment.  Maybe she does know.  She
            rubs her cheek against his.


                                DANICA
                     You don't want to go back to being one of
                     us --
                          (her lips grazing his)
                     -- do you?


            King tries to turn his head away, but Danica grips his chin,
            turning his head back.  He's sweating now.  Worried.


                                DANICA
                     I'm going to bite you again, King.  And
                     then I'm going to leave you here while you
                     turn.  I'm going to watch you, day after
                     day, while the Thirst keeps building and
                     building.  And then, when you can't stand
                     it anymore --


            She nods.  Drake appears, holding Zoe.  She's alive. 
            Terrified.  Held firm in Drake's arms.


                                DANICA
                     -- I'm going to bring the little girl
                     for you to feed on.  Would you like that,
                     King?  Would you enjoy taking her life?


            King shuts his eyes, sickened at the thought.  Danica smiles.


                                DANICA
                     Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOOTING RANGE - NIGHT


            Abigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her
            bows.  Nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment -- a
            bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets.


            Across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets
            set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows. 
            There's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer
            to measure arrow speed.


            CLOSE ON Abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion,
            re-setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the
            center-shot position and wheel timing, etc.


            BLADE


            appears in the doorway, watching her.


                                BLADE
                     You alright?


                                ABIGAIL
                          (brusque)
                     I'll be fine.


            Blade nods.  He's going to leave her alone -- but then he
            hesitates, wrestling to say something.


                                BLADE
                     Don't let it turn inward.


            Abigail takes a deep breath, pausing in her work.


                                ABIGAIL
                     It already has.  Since I can remember
                     I've had this knife of sadness in my
                     heart.  As long as it stays there, I'm
                     strong.  I'm untouchable.  But the moment
                     I pull it out --
                          (turning back to him)
                     -- I'll die.


            Blade nods.  He understands all too well.  He leaves.


            ON ABIGAIL


            She stands, moving to the shooting range.  She straps on a
            quiver, takes aim at


            A 3-D HUMAN-SHAPED TARGET


            about a hundred feet away.  Just in front of the target is the
            chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts.


            WHOOSH!  Abigail FIRES an arrow.  It flies through the arms of
            the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest.  On the
            screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked
            at 240 feet per second.  We move CLOSER to her now as--


            WHOOSH!  Abicail FIRES again. The speed is 242 fps. CLOSER --


            WHOOSH!  Now the speed is 269 fps. EVEN CLOSER --


            WHOOSH!WHOOSH!WHOOSH!  285 fps.  302 fps.  315 fps!  The arrow
            speed creeps up and up as we move CLOSER AND CLOSER to Abigail
            until we --


            -- PULL BACK.  Abigail has fired every arrow in her quiver. 


            ON THE TARGET


            The arrows have formed a cross in the target's chest.  One
            vertical grouping running up, another horizontal grouping
            bisecting it.


            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - GARAGE - NIGHT


            Blade stands at the open entrance.  Abigail steps out.  Looks
            like she's made peace with herself for the moment.


                                ARIGAIL
                     I'm ready to go.


            HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance.  Another Land Cruiser
            approaches, weaving through the amusement park.  It pulls to a
            stop in front of them.  The driver's side window rolls down.


            A MAN (CAULDER)


            sits behind the wheel.  He raises a hand in greeting.


                                CAULDER
                     My name is Caulder.  And I'll be your
                     driver this evening.


            INT. CAULDER'S LAND CRUISER - NIGHT


            Caulder's Land Cruiser glides through the streets.


                                BLADE
                     Where are you taking us?


                                CAULDER
                     Another safehouse.


                                ABIGAIL
                     We told you, Blade.  We operate in sleeper
                     cells.  When one goes down, a new cell
                     activates to pick up the slack.


            EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - NIGHT


            Caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store.


            INT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - NIGHT


            Caulder unlocks an accordion security gate, opens the door. 
            He leads Blade and Abigail through the darkened aisles.  There
            are fish tanks on either side, aerators BUBBLING, aquatic
            animals of every kind swimming about.


            IN THE BACK


            is another arsenal/lab area.  This one is smaller than the
            Nightstalkers' main headquarters.  Caulder moves to a
            computer, calls up a file.  A dialogue box for a media player
            opens.  Caulder activates a video file.


                                CAULDER
                     Sommerfield left a video message for you.


            ON THE MONITOR


            The video plays.  We see Sommerfield's face on the screen. 
            She looks grave, as if she might have been crying.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                          (on video)
                     If you're watching this, I'm already dead.
                     If Zoe's still alive, I want you to
                     promise you'll take care of her.  I've
                     been reading her The Oz books every night. 
                     We just started The Emerald City of Oz,
                     the one with the Nome King --


            Her voice cracks and she pauses, wiping away a tear.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     I think I've managed to cultivate a
                     workable strain of the Daystar virus.  As
                     a precaution, I transmitted the genetic
                     sequence to Caulder, in case our main
                     stock was destroyed.  In order for it to
                     achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to
                     interfuse it with Drake's blood.  If it
                     works, any vampires in the immediate
                     vicinity should die almost instantly. 
                     After that, it should take only a few
                     weeks for the virus to spread throughout
                     the rest of the world.


            Zoe hesitates, deciding how to broach the next subject.


                                SOMMERFIELD
                     There's one other thing, Blade.  You need
                     to know that there's a chance the virus
                     could destroy you too.  Because you're a
                     hybrid, I'm not sure whether your immune
                     system will be able tolerate it.
                          (beat)
                     I'm sorry.  We didn't have enough time to
                     properly test it.


            The video cuts to STATIC.  Abigail turns off the monitor,
            looking to Blade.  God only knows what he's thinking.


                                CAULDER
                     Take a look at the plague arrow.


            Caulder reaches for a refrigerated aluminum case, snapping it
            open.  Inside, resting on a bed of form-fitting foam, is a
            glass ampule that's been fitted into a stake-like contraption. 
            It looks like the head of a high-tech harpoon.


                                CAULDER
                     I only had time to fabricate a small batch
                     of Daystar.  I outfitted it with a
                     compressed gas projectile, so you should
                     be able to fire it from one of the
                     fourbarrel rifles or a bow.
                          (beat)
                     Just make sure the shot counts, cause we
                     don't have enough for a second try.


            A SERIES OF DISSOLVES


            Abigail sits before a laptop, creating another custom MP3
            playlist.  We watch as she hi-lights songs with her mouse,
            moves them over to her portable device with a few CLICKS.


            Abigail unhooks her MP3 device, slips her earbud headphones
            into her ears.  The SOUNDS of Fluke's track Atom Bomb fade up,
            gradually shifting from tinny source music to SOUNDTRACK.


            MORE DISSOLVES


            Blade and Abigail suit up, arming themselves.  We SEE:


            Blade loading rounds into his pistols.


            Abigail selecting arrows, checking the range-dials.


            Blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers.


            Abigail working with Caulder, affixing the plague capsule to
            one of her arrowheads.


            Blade polishes his sword.  Finished, he sights down the length
            of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back
            scabbard with a flourish.


            EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT


            We hear the RUMBLE of two motorcycles.  Blade emerges from the
            alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket.  Abigail
            appears a moment later on her own customized bike.


            Blade revs his engine.  Then the two bikes take off.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            Drake sits before Zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his


            right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his
            burial armor.  The rest of the armor has been propped up on a
            stand nearby.


                                DRAKE
                     Do you know who I am?


                                ZOE
                     You're the Nome King.


            Drake smiles at this.


                                DRAKE
                     The Nome King.  I like that.
                          (leaning closer)
                     Tell me, child.  Do you want to die?


            Zoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant.


                                ZOE
                     I'm not afraid -- I'll go to Heaven.


                                DRAKE
                     There is no Heaven.  No God.  No angels.
                     No happy ending for good little girls.
                     The only thing you have to look forward to
                     is nothingness.


            As Drake talks his pupils seem to widen -- until the darkness
            nearly occludes the whites of his eyes.  Zoe stares at him. 
            Can't tear her gaze away.  His eyes are hypnotic.


                                DRAKE
                     But what if you could change that?  What
                     if you could remain a child forever?


            He reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek.


                                DRAKE
                     What if you could keep this little doll-
                     like face of yours until the sun itself
                     cooled to a cold, hard rock?
                          (beat)
                     Wouldn't you like that?  Wouldn't you
                     accept that gift?


            Zoe reaches out, calmly touches Drake's cheek.


                                ZOE
                     My friends are coming to kill you.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            WHACK!  Grimwood PUNCHES King, whose body sags, weakened from
            the beatings he has undergone.  Asher and Danica look on.


                                KING
                     -- gonna be sorry you did that --


                                ASHER
                     Nobody's coming for you, King.


                                KING
                     Sure they are.  Left a trail of digital
                     bread crumbs --


                                DANICA
                     Excuse me?


                                KING
                     One thing you need to know about us
                     Nightstalkers.  When you join our club,
                     you get this nifty little tracking node
                     surgically implanted in your body --


                                GRIMWOOD
                     Bullshit.


                                KING
                     Scout's honor.  One of us gets lost, the
                     others just dial up the satellite and
                     presto, instant cavalry.


            Grimwood looks to Asher and Danica, unsure.


                                AS HER
                     He's bluffing.


                                DANICA
                          (smiling, playing along)
                     Okay, King, where did they put this
                     tracking node of yours?


            He motions for her to draw closer, whispering.


                                KING
                     It's in my left ass-cheek --


            WHACK!  Danica slaps King's face, making him see stars.


                                KING
                     Alright.  alright, it's in my right ass-
                     cheek --


            WHACK!  Danica slaps King again, this time knocking his head
            the other way.  He spits out blood --


                                KING
                     No, seriously --
                          (gasping)
                     -- it's in the meat of my butt, right
                     below my Bart Simpson tattoo --


            Danica PUNCHES King's mid-section.  He sucks air.  Despite his
            attempts at humor, he's hurting now.  His body sags --


                                KING
                     -- pull down my tighty-whities -- see for
                     yourself.


                                DANICA
                     ENOUGH!  It's not funny anymore!


            Behind Danica, Grimwood and Asher both COUGH.


            King lifts his bruised face, staring up at Danica through
            blood-shrouded eyes.  For the first time, we get a sense of
            his true hatred for her.


                                KING
                     No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch --
                          (wincing as he breathes)
                     -- but it will be a few seconds from now.


                                DANICA
                          (coughing)
                     And what happens then, lover?


                                KING
                     Hammer time.
                          (beat)
                     See, that tickle in your throat you're
                     feeling right now?


            Danica COUGHS again, blinks repeatedly, as if her eyes were
            irritated.  She rubs them, looks to the others.  They're
            feeling the effects too.  And Grimwood's face is smoking!


                                KING
                     That's atomized colloidal silver.


            Danica keys into the RUMBLE of the air-conditioning system and
            a HISSING SOUND beneath that.  She looks up --


                                KING
                     It's being pumped into the building's air
                     conditioning system.


            ANGLE ON THE HEATING REGISTER ABOVE


            We GO MACRO, shrinking down until we see a CLOUD OF TINY
            SILVER PARTICLES blowing into the room.  The particles are
            dusting the vampires, being unwittingly inhaled by them and --


            WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL


            as the vampires react en mass, suddenly gagging, their throats
            and faces on fire.


                                KING
                     Which means that the fat lady should be
                     singing right about --


            GRIMWOOD


            has caught the worst of it.  A whole lung-full.  He SHRIEKS as
            He coughs up blue-tinged FLAMES, the flesh on his face
            simultaneously burning away and --


                                KING
                     -- NOW


            THE SKYLIGHT ABOVE THEM


            SHATTERS as Blade crashes down.  He lands in a cat-like
            stance, then flips over into a cartwheel, KICKING Grimwood in
            the face.  As Grimwood goes down, Asher and Danica scatter --


            Blade tackles Grimwood, sending both of them over the railing
            into the lower level of the penthouse.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            ALARMS are ringing.  Asher and Danica rush down the hall,
            trying not to breathe the silver-contaminated air.  We SEE
            other vampires staggering from doorways, COUGHING, GAGGING.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            Drake hears the ALARMS.  He reaches for his sword, which rests
            in a nearby stand.  As he heads out, he strides past Zoe,
            still chained to the wall.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            On the lower level, Blade and Grimwood are going at it.


            REINFORCENENTS


            flood in from multiple entry ways.  It's an all-out melee. 
            Blade is seriously overwhelmed, but the sheer number of
            vampires and humans is actually slowing them down.


            Blade takes on a half-dozen of them at once, stunning one of
            the familiars, using him as a human shield, TOSSING him aside
            to trip up another on-rushing pair.


            Then he pauses, instantly calculating the geography of the
            room, the relative positions of the other combatants,
            assessing decorations and furniture as possible weapons.  His
            battle plan ready, Blade engages his enemies once again.


            MEANWHILE, ON THE UPPER LEVEL


            Abigail appears at the lip of the smashed-in skylight.  She
            lowers herself down on a rope, rushes to King's side --


                                ABIGAIL
                     You alright?


                                KING
                     Nothing a hot tub full of Bactine won't
                     fix.


            Abigail hits the release switch on the high-tech pillory and
            the cuffs around his wrists open.  As Abigail helps King out:


                                ABIGAIL
                     Zoe --


                                KING
                     Drake's got her.


            Abigail nods, handing King her pistol.  Then she's out the
            door.  Seconds later, King follows --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAYS - VARIOUS - NIGHT


            Abigail pauses, slipping her earbuds in, turning on her MP3
            player.  The bumping-strains of Fluke's Absurd track kick in. 
            Abigail uncilps her UV arc, telescopes it outward and --


            -- suddenly it's like we're in a first-person shooter video
            game.  She moves through the corridors with mathematical
            precision, feeling the MUSIC in her bones, slicing through
            every vampire she encounters with deadly efficiency.


            VAMPIRES AND HUMAN FAMILIARS


            are coming out from every doorway.


            Abigail PUNCHES one in the solar plexus, DECAPITATES another,
            finishes off the first.  Then she's moving on, taking down a
            third, fourth, and fifth vampire with her rapid-fire stake
            dispenser.  Throwing stakes with blinding speed.


            After a half-dozen stakes, her dispenser is empty.  Without
            missing a beat, she presses a tab on the dispenser, ejects the
            clip, then reaches to her belt where a back-up is secured and
            slaps it in place.  The mayhem continues.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT


            Blade unsheathes his sword.  He parries two combatants with
            clubs, then whirls around, DEFLECTING a GUNSHOT from a third
            with the flat of his sword.


            Grimwood is furious.  His men are tripping all over
            themselves.  He grabs an antique battle axe that's secured to
            the wall.  He sees an opening, SWINGS at Blade's head --


            -- Blade drops and the axe slices through one of Grimwood's
            own men.


            In an eye-blink, Blade is up again, advancing.  He cuts down
            another familiar, pushes forward, cuts oown a second --


            Now Blade and Grimwood are face to face.  Grimwood swings his
            axe again.  Blade hooks his sword beneath it, FLIPPING it from
            Grimwood's hands.


            Blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc, CUTTING straight
            through Grimwood's mid-section.  The upper half of Grimwood's
            body topples away --


            -- then he rights himself.  A half-vampire.  He's still alive,
            running forward on his hands, trailing viscera.  He SPRINGS UP
            at Blade, all claws and gnashing teeth.


            Blade catches Grimwood by the throat, whirls him around --


            --  and manages to IMPALE what's left of Grimwood with his
            sword-point.  Grimwood ASHES in Blade's arms.  The only thing
            left are his steel teeth, which CLATTER to the floor at
            Blade's feet.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


            Abigail enters, SEES Zoe.  TWO VAMPIRES GUARDS stand nearby. 
            In a flash, Abigail flings TWO SILVER STAKES at them.  Both
            stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to ASH.


            Abigail hurries over, SHOOTS apart the lock on Zoe's shackle.
            Zoe wraps her arms around Abigail, hugging her tight.  Abigail
            takes Zoe by the hand, pulling her towards the door.


                                ABIGAIL
                     Come on, hon.  Let's get you out of here.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            King stumbles out into the hallway, pulling his shirt back on. 
            As he limps down the corridor, a GROWL makes him pause --


            KING'S POV


            Beau, the vampire rottweiler, lopes around the corner.  Then --


            TWO MORE ROTTWEILERS


            emerge behind Beau.  They're all GROWLING now.


                                KING
                          (under his breath)
                     Fuck.  Me.  Sideways.


            The three of them break, BARKING like crazy, snouts splitting
            open as their jaws flower apart.


            CUT T0:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            Blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium.


            DRAKE


            stands before him, waiting, sword in hand.  He extends it,
            touching the tip to the floor.  A challenge.


                                DRAKE
                     Are you ready to die, Blade?


                                BLADE
                     Been ready since the day I was born,
                     mother-fucker.


                                DRAKE
                          (with a smile)
                     Then allow me to accommodate you.


            Drake does a back-flip over the balcony.  Forty feet down.


            Blade follows, drawing his sword as he LEAPS --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            -- and lands.  Now the two warriors face each other, swords
            raised, eyes locked, their stances frozen.  Like classic
            samurai.  Whoever moves first, loses.


            Beat.  MOVING IN on both men, CIRCLING around them.  Slow the
            heart.  Slow the breath.  Find the opening.


            DRAKE


            breaks first, bringing his sword over in less time than it
            takes to blink an eye.  No one could possibly deflect the
            blow.  And yet --


            BLADE


            manages a COUNTER-STROKE with super-human grace.  He advances,
            parries, his sword CLANGING and SINGING like a blacksmith's
            hammer on sheet metal.


            Cut, thrust, block, diagonal downward slashes.  The moves come
            faster.  Drake DUCKS, barely avoiding being decapitated. 
            Blade's sword cuts right through a column instead.


            Drake retaliates.  Blade locks swords with him.  For a moment,
            the two warriors are nose to nose.  Then Blade twists his
            sword free, cutting open Drake's cheek --


            Drake GROWLS, back-flipping up onto a ledge.  He touches his
            fingertips to the cut, tastes his own blood.  Then we hear the
            telltale sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING.  For a brief moment, his
            facial features shift, giving us yet another glimpse of his
            true form.  As his anger increases, Drake begins to devolve.


            He DIVES at Blade, HOWLING, raking his CLAWS at Blade's face. 
            He strikes out, KNOCKING Blade across the atrium.  He SPRINGS
            forward, dragging Blade up by his throat, sinking his fangs
            into Blade's shoulder.  Blide SCREAMS and we --


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            -- as King runs.  He hazards a look back.  The vampire dogs
            are quickly gaining on him.


            UP AHEAD


            It's a dead-end.  Just plate glass windows and a whole lot of
            nothing beyond.


            The dogs are almost on King when suddenly, King JUMPS,
            snagging an overhead pipe.  As he swings his body upward --


            THE DOGS


            skid on the floor, unable to stop their momentum, and CRASH
            straight through the plate glass window.


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT


            An EXPLOSION OF GLASS as two of the vampire rottweilers tumble
            into the night.  They fall like stones -- twenty stories down
            into the traffic-clogged intersection below.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT


            King drops back to the floor, cackling, pleased with himself. 
            It takes him a second to realize that --


            ONE OF THE ROTTWEILERS (BEAU)


            -- didn't take a swan dive out the window.  He's right behind
            King.  And now he's SPRINGING FORWARD --


            WHAM!  King is hit in the chest by the SNARLING beast.  He
            drops the pistol as he's knocked back onto the floor.  The dog
            LUNGES again --


            With one arm, King struggles to keep his face from being bit
            off, while searching blindly for the discarded pistol.  King
            locates it, FIRING into the beast's chest --


            THE ROTTWEILER


            ASHES, disintegrating all over King's face.  King gets a
            mouthful of the charcoal remains, tries to SPIT them out.


                                KING
                          (making a face)
                     Bad dog.


                                                                  CUT TO:


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            Abigail emerges onto the gallery with Zoe.  She spots an
            alcove, indicates that Zoe should hide.  Then she slips a
            silver stake into Zoe's hand.  Just in case.


            Abigail rushes to the handrail, looking down at Blade and
            Drake.  Her view is obscured.  She can't get a good shot.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            Drake digs his fangs into Blade's shoulder.  Blade struggles,
            manages to slip a stake from his bandolier --


            WHAM!  Blade SLAMS the stake into Drake's ear canal.  The
            beast SHRIEKS in pain, dropping Blade.  But all the gambit has
            done is drive Drake into a berserker rage.


            Drake swings his fist.  Blade ducks.  Drake's fist goes
            through the wall, PUNCTURING a steam pipe.  Steam vents --


            Drake reaches in, RIPS an eight-foot section of the pipe from
            the wall, bringing a SPARKING nest of electrical cables along
            with it.  He swings the pipe section around, WHACKING Blade.


            KRUNCH!  Drake swings the makeshift club again.  He's a one
            man demolition crew, decimating everything in his path.  He's
            SMASHING holes in the floor, the walls, plowing through
            partitions of glass and steel.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            Abigail moves down the gallery, looks up --


            A SERIES OF LIGHTING GANTRIES


            span the length of the atrium ceiling.


            Abigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space --


            -- catching hold of one of the crosspieces.  Like an acrobat,
            she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry.  If she loses
            her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet.


            BA-BANG!  A bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering
            her with SPARKS.  MORE BULLETS follow.


            ANGLE ON PAIR OF VAMPIRES


            FIRING from below, trying to pick her off.  Suddenly, UV
            BULLETS strike each of the vampires.  As they ASH we --


            WHIP-PAN BACK TO KING,


            having dragged his battered body out onto the upper gallery. 
            He's playing guardian angel to Abigail, laying down cover fire
            so she can continue.  But then --


                                DANICA
                     KING!!!


            DANICA


            appears behind King.  She TACKLES him, wrestling him to the
            floor, pummeling his face with her fist.


            King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched.
            He swings his electronic pistol up --


            Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the
            stock.  King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor. 
            She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT


            Back to Abigail.  She's breathing heavily, trying to call up
            new reserves of strength.  She glances down --


            Big mistake.


            She forces herself to look back up.  She swings herself
            pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece.  A
            SHOT RINGS OUT --


            ANGLE ON ASHER,


            down below, armed with a rifle.  He FIRES again --


            -- grazing Abigail's shoulder with the bullet.  Abigail CRIES
            OUT, nearly losing her grip.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            King rolls on his side, spits out a bloody tooth.


                                KING
                     No offense, Danica --
                          (gasping in pain)
                     -- but I've wanted to kill you since the
                     moment we slept together.


                                DANICA
                     I was that bad, huh?


            King reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol, points
            it vaguely in Danica's direction.  She LAUGHS.


                                DANICA
                     No bullets in your gun, King.


                                KING
                     Yeah, but here's the beauty --
                          (wiping his bloody mouth)
                     -- these babies can be triggered remotely.


            King pulls the trigger.  The scattered sun dog bullets ERUPT
            with UV LIGHT.  Danica SHRIEKS, trying to shield her already
            burning face from the glare.  She runs, horribly wounded.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            Drake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll. 
            He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty
            feet --


            SMASH!  Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging
            glass chandelier/lighting fixture.


            Blade FALLS back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword. 
            Drake pounces on him.  Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows
            anymore.  In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's
            eyes.


            Drake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style, SHATTERING an
            entire section of the limestone flooring.


            A SHOCK-WAVE ripples out from the point of impact, sending
            waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air,
            knocking Blade off his feet.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT


            King loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the
            railing, and FIRES at Asher --


            THE SUN DOG


            screams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's
            open mouth.  The bullet EXPLODES.  UV LIGHT causes Asher's
            skull to burn up from the inside out.  His headless corpse
            falls forward over the gallery railing.  Then it too
            carbonizes and BURNS UP.


            Relieved, King sinks to his knees.


            BEHIND KING,


            we SEE Zoe slip from the alcove.  She makes for the stairs.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT


            King has bought Abigail more time.  She swings her body
            forward, hooking her legs over the next crosspiece.  Then she
            lets go with her hands.  Now she is hanging upside down,
            secured only by the tension in her calves.


            Abigail reaches behind her, removes her bow.  BLOOD from her
            wounded shoulder drips down over her collar bone, reaching her
            cheek, briefly obscuring her vision.  She wipes it away.  Then
            she reaches back once more and --


            -- because her quiver is pointed downward, a number of arrows
            slide out. Abigail panics, twisting her body --


            -- managing to lust barely snag the ~la~ue arrow as it tumbles
            Past her!


            Beat.  Abigail shuts her eyes, trying to find her center. 
            With her eyes closed, she nocks the arrow and draws the bow
            back.  Then she opens her eyes.


            She's only going to get one shot -- and she's going to have to
            take it while hanging upside down.


168 a       ABIGAIL'S POV                                      168 a  


            On Drake and Blade below, locked in combat.  She tracks their
            progress, waits for Drake to move into a better position --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            Drake shoulders a support column, SNAPPING it in two.  An
            entire section of the gallery walkway above comes CRASHING
            DOWN, burying Blade in debris --


            -- but it's not enough for Drake.  He LEAPS forward, fishing
            Blade out, hauling him up --


            Drake head-butts Blade -- once, twice.  Blade's eyes roll to
            whites.  Drake looks down, SEES Blade's discarded sword. 
            Drake scoops it up, STRIKES at Blade --


            Blade manages to roll to the side, avoiding the blow.


            Drake STRIKES again, dealing Blade a glancing blow --


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT


            ON ABIGAIL.  Waiting.  More blood has trickled down her neck,
            into her eyes.  But she can't wipe them anymore.  She's
            already got her bow drawn.  She's committed to the shot.


            We can hear ABIGAIL'S HEARTBEAT as she settles.  She takes a
            final breath, holds it -- and lets the plague arrow fly.


            ON THE PLAGUE ARROW


            as it streaks downward, hurtling towards Drake at more than
            300 feet per second.  Then, at the last possible instant	--


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT


            CHINGG!  Drake deflects the arrow with his sword.  It
            harmlessly falls to the floor, rolling a few yards away.


            ON ABIGAIL,


            stunned, her expression melting into despair.


            BACK TO DRAKE


            swinging Blade's sword around.  PLUNGING it into Blade's side.
            As he pulls it back out again --


            BLADE


            GASPS, sinking downward.  He's on his knees now, in shock.


            Drake ROARS again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of
            violence and predation.  And the nightmare shape that was only
            hinted at before, finally takes center-stage.


            BLOOD suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson.  His
            canines elongate, his lower jaw distends. 
            Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing
            a suit of razor-sharp thorns.  He doesn't need a sword
            anymore.  He's become a living weapon.  Drake is gone.  Now he
            is --


            THE BEAST


            Drake swings the sword overhead.  He's going to decapitate
            Blade.  And just as the sword reaches the top of its arc --


            ZOE


            emerges from the shadows behind Drake, clutching a silver
            stake.  She SHOVES it into Drake's back,  pushing with all the
            strength her little body can muster.


            Drake staggers.  The blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the
            same.  He turns on Zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for
            one crucial second --


            ON BLADE,


            summoning the last of his reserves.  He pitches his body
            forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow.  And
            before Drake even realizes what is happening --


            WHAM!  Blade sinks the plague arrow deep into Drake's chest. 
            Drake drops the sword, turning back to face Blade --


            Exhausted beyond measure, Blade sags.


            INSIDE DRAKE'S CHEST - MACRO SHOT


            as the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon.  We SEE the virus
            flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as
            his circulatory system carries it throughout his body.


            ON DRAKE'S FACE,


            letting loose an INHUMAN SCREAM, vomiting up a spray of blood
            mist.  His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into
            his more familiar face.  At the same time we --


            GO MACR0 ONCE MORE


            Shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake
            expelled.  We continue shrinking until we are moving with the
            individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions
            latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic. 
            Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by --


            DANICA,


            having retreated from her defeat by King.  She clutches her
            throat.  We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny
            BLACK THREADS expand across her face.  She sways, falling onto
            the floor.  She reaches a beseeching hand towards King --


            -- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips.


            MORE VAMPIRES


            are feeling the effects now too.  One by one they drop,
            choking, going into convulsions.  As they writhe on the floor,
            we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies.


            BACK TO BLADE AND DRAKE


            Drake slumps against the wall.  Hero and villain are now
            separated by only a few feet.  Both at death's door.


                                DRAKE
                     Well done, hunter.  Well done.


            Blade stares back.  At this point, he's just trying to remain
            conscious.  He's lost a ton of blood.


                                DRAKE 
                     You fought with honor --


            Drake shudders, his breathing becoming increasingly shallow.


                                DRAKE
                     -- as I knew you would.  The humans are
                     coming for you, you know.  In their eyes,
                     you and I are the same.
                     Allow me one last indulgence, then --
                          (gasping)
                     -- a parting gift --


            Drake grows still, his eyes locked on Blade's.


            ABIGAIL AND KING


            rush to Blade's side.  Zoe joins them.  Blade is dying, fading
            fast.  Abigail shakes Blade --


                                ABIGAIL

                     Blade!


            Her voice sounds distant and muted, overridden by Blade's own
            HEARTBEAT which is fading up, dominating the soundtrack.


                                ABIGAIL
                     BLADE!!!


            Blade's eyes can't focus anymore.  They're clouding over.


                                BLADE'S POV
                     We drop away from Abigail and King -- like
                     we're falling down


            a dark tunnel.	 Then the world FADES TO WHITE.


            EXT. CITYSCAPE	- DAWN


            FADE IN FROM WHITE.  We see the sky, the burning orb of the
            rising sun.  A trio of FBI helicopters ride out from the dawn,
            swooping down over the stirring city.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     It didn't take long for the authorities
                     to arrive.


            INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - DAWN


            Cumberland sits in the front passenger seat, Hale behind him.


            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PLAZA - DAWN


            As the helicopters touch down in the plaza we see a small
            convoy of POLICE and FBI VEHICLES converging around them.


            Cumberland and Hale are among the first out.  They rush
            towards the Phoenix Towers entrance, guns drawn, DOZENS OF
            AGENTS and OFFICERS behind them.


            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - DAWN


            The first rays of sun penetrate through the atrium windows
            setting the scattered vampire corpses ablaze.  Danica, Asher,
            and the others all ignite.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     When they got there, all of Drake's
                     people were dead.


            By the time Cumberland and his men have entered, fanning out
            through the atrium, all they find are a series of corpse
            shaped piles of ash and singe marks.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     In the weeks that followed, the rest of
                     the world's vampires also perished.
                          (beat)
                     We'd finally won.


            ON CUMBERLAND,


            surveying the scene, frustrated by what he's found.  Then we
            hear SHOUTS coming from the back of the atrium.


            AT THE BACK OF THE ATRIUM


            they find Blade.  He's dead, slumped against a wall.  There's
            no sign of Drake.  The vampire king is gone.


            INT. FBI MORGUE - DAY


            CLOSE ON Blade's face, his body being wheeled on an autopsy
            gurney.  PULL BACK to reveal that we are in an FBI morgue.
            Cumberland and Hale stand nearby, overseeing everything as --


            A TRIO OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS


            lift Blade's body onto an autopsy table.  They turn on a bank
            of overhead UV lights.  The lead examiner reaches for a
            scalpel.  But as he touches the scalpel to Blade's chest --


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     And Blade?  Cumberland and Hale finally
                     got their body --


            BLADE'S FACE


            changes.  We hear a series of POPS and CRACKS as subdermal
            cartilage begins to loosen and shift.  At the same time, the
            skin begins to lighten as melanin is gradually leached away.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                     -- but it wasn't the one they were banking
                     on.


            ON CUMBERLAND AND THE OTHERS


            as they react with varying degrees of shock.


            BACK TO THE BODY


            We realize that it's not Blade lying before them.  It's Drake.
            Somehow, even in death, the vampire king managed to take
            Blade's shape and temporarily retain it.


                                ABIGAIL (V.O.)
                     The virus didn't kill Blade.  But the
                     authorities very well could have.  So in
                     the end, realizing that own his people
                     were doomed, Drake decided to give Blade a
                     gift.


            (beat)


                                ABIGAIL (CONT ÃâD)
                     By taking Blade's shape, he bought Blade
                     enough time to escape.  Offering Blade a
                     second chance at life - -


                                                              DISSOLVE TO:


            EXT. SEASIDE CLIFF - DAY


            A bright summer day.  Blade stands at the edge of a cliff,
            looking out over a sun-struck ocean.  For the first time since
            we've seen him, he's not wearing armor or sunglasses or
            handguns or rifles.  And were it not for the sword he holds,
            we might even mistake him for an ordinary man.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     And so Blade took it.


            Blade flings his sword over the cliff, into the ocean below. 


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     We never saw him again.


            UNDERWATER


            We see the sword sinking, reflecting the refracted sunlight
            from above as it twirls end over end.


            BACK TO BLADE


            At peace with himself at last.  After a moment's reflection,
            he turns and walks away.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     He disappeared completely.
                          (beat)
                     But that's what heroes do.  They simply
                     fade out.  And in this way --


            A SERIES OF DISSOLVES


            as Blade moves further and further away from us, dwindling
            into the horizon until he disappears entirely.


                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
                     -- they become legends.


                                                            FADE TO BLACK.


            Over darkness we hear the sound of TRAFFIC.


            EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT


            FADE IN.  We are moving towards a local punk dive wedged into
            a crowded block in the meat packing district.


            A DOORMAN (LUCIUS) stands outside, checking CUSTOMERS' IDs.We
            hear HILLBILLY THRASH MUSIC coming from within.


            ANGLE ON KING AND ABIGAIL


            approaching.  King holds his four-barreled rifle.  Abigail
            peels away, disappearing into an alley as King nears the front
            door.  The doorman recognizes King, knows he's trouble.


                                KING
                     Evening Lucius.


                                LUCIUS
                     King, what the hell are you doing here?


                                KING
                     Just a little sport hunting.


            INT. CLUB CROWBAR - NIGHT


            A BAND belts out a cover of Sam and the Shams' Little Red
            Riding Hood.  The band members look a little lupine.  As King
            weaves his way through the crowd, Lucius hurries alongside.


                                LUCIUS
                     Ain't no vampires left, King.  So who do
                     you have to hunt?


                                KING
                     That's an interesting question, my friend. 
                     And I've got a question for you in return.


            INT. CLUB CROWBAR - BACK AREA - NIGHT


            As King pushes his way through to the bathrooms, we hear an
            UNEARTHLY ROAR coming from the men's room.


                                KING
                     What do you get when you cross a vampire
                     with a werewolf?


            The door to the men's room EXPLODES OPEN.  Abigail comes
            flying out.  She hits the far wall of the hallway, slides to
            th floor.  But she's up in an instant, pulling a knife on --


                                KING
                          (raising his four-barrel)
                     A fur coat that sticks to your neck.


            A HILL-BILLY HIPSTER WERE-CREATURE,


            wearing a blood-soaked Stray Cats-style suit.  The ephedrine
            nightmare creature looks at King, opening his elongated snout
            to flash a set of razor-sharp canid teeth.


                                KING
                     Don't you know fur is murder?


            As King FIRES point-blank into the were-creature we --

Brazil - the screenplay


 


                            Brazil
                      Screenplay (Draft)




 

1   EXT.   CITYSCAPE                         SUNSET           1

    A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The
    CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises
    into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
    frame. The building is neither past nor future in design
    but a bit of both.
    
    Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
    below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated
    transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely
    huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule
    relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level
    awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent
    tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an
    elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of
    large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,
    the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs
    take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper
    levels of a plush shopping precinct.

2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT                  NIGHT            2
    
    Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,
    ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on
    display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly
    packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of
    elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one
    window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the
    screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister
    of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to
    listen to HELPMANN.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Deputy minister, what do you believe
               is behind this recent increase in
               terrorist bombings?

                           HELPMANN
               Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless
               minority of people seems to have
               forgotten certain good old fashioned
               virtues. They just can't stand seeing
               the other fellow win. If these people
               would just play the game, instead of
               standing on the touch line heckling -

                          INTERVIEWER
               In fact, killing people -

                           HELPMANN
               - In fact, killing people - they'd
               get a lot more out of life.

    We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.
    HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to
               those critics who maintain that the
               Ministry Of Information has become
               too large and unwieldy ...?

                           HELPMANN
               David ... in a free society
               information is the name of the game.
               You can't win the game if you're a
               man short.

    Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be
    banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow"
    turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop
    front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.
    WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood
    sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are
    being played by a Salvation Army style band calling
    themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is
    busy, all is well with the world.

                          INTERVIEWER
               And the cost of it all, Deputy
               Minister? Seven percent of the gross
               national produce ...

                           HELPMANN
               I understand this concern on behalf
               of the tax-payers. People want value
               for money and a cost-effective
               service.

3   INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT            3

    CUT TO TV screen with HELPMANN still talking.

                           HELPMANN
               That is why we always insist on the
               principle of Information Retrieval
               Charges. These terrorists are not
               pulling their weight, and it's
               absolutely right and fair that those
               found guilty should pay for their
               periods of detention and the
               Information Retrieval Procedures used
               in their interrogation.

    PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests
    on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-
    tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He
    comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to
    discover a shiny, metal "executive toy".

    CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.

    The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as
    it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some
    paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.

Scenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.

13  INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT           13
    
    The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his
    desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE
    still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath
    him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away
    compiling a typed list of names under the heading
    "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &
    Interview". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper
    which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic
    guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate
    sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet
    following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-
    UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in
    the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.
    ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER,
    John D. ... Every name begins with T.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Do you think that the government is
               winning the battle against
               terrorists?

                           HELPMANN
               On yes. Our morale is much higher
               than theirs, we're fielding all their
               strokes, running a lot of them out,
               and pretty consistently knocking them
               for six. I'd say they're nearly out
               of the game.
               
    The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the
    desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE. Swish, swash, oops,
    WHAP! Gottcha!!

                          INTERVIEWER
               But the bombing campaign is now in
               its thirteenth year ...

                           HELPMANN
               Beginner's luck.

    The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on
    the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the
    TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the
    BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops
    silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,
    hesitates and then types the letter "B" and hesitates and
    then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.

    The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine
    continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW,
    Peter...

                          INTERVIEWER
               Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

                           HELPMANN
               Thank you, David ... and a very merry
               Christmas to you all.

14  EXT.   HOUSING TOWERS                    NIGHT           14
    
    ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we
    TIGHTEN in on one of several massive residential tower
    blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of
    the city

15  INT.   BUTTLE FLAT                       NIGHT           15
    
    HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits
    rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune.
    PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional
    sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out
    the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
    snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller
    conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
    services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the
    metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but
    proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading
    Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.
    BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
    action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting
    the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present
    which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just
    seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.

    Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of
    the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the
    floor above.

16  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           16

    The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming
    from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt. Bilko. From
    BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom
    straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the
    person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath
    is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she
    watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror,
    the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body
    of a MAN in uniform.

                             JILL
                    (scared)
               Who's there?

17  INT.   BUTTLE'S FLAT                     NIGHT           17
    
    The BUTTLE FAMILY as before. MRS BUTTLE is closing the
    book.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               There, that's enough for tonight. He
               won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get
               plenty of sleep.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Father Christmas can't come if we
               haven't got a chimney.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               You'll see.

    The GIRL exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and
    leaves the room.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               How will he get down from upstairs?

                          BOY BUTTLE
               It's a secret.

    We follow GIRL BUTTLE out of the sitting room into ...

18  INT.   HALLWAY AND CHILDREN'S BEDROOM    NIGHT           18

    GIRL BUTTLE enters her bedroom. There is little or no
    light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently
    lowering himself into the room from the direction of the
    ceiling.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
                    (unalarmed)
               You've come ...

    As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the
    figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,
    slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The
    pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the
    ceiling. Things become immediately clearer

19  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM               NIGHT           19

    Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash
    trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in
    the window from the outside and enters that way. Most
    alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the
    ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and
    through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide
    TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal
    and violent.
    
    BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike
    canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal
    clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back
    of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In
    seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL
    BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into
    the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy
    machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we
    see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has
    been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are
    viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the
    doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An
    OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front
    door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an
    official document. It goes something like this:

                           OFFICIAL
               I hereby inform you under powers
               entrusted to me under Section 47,
               Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number
               438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,
               residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri
               La Towers, has been invited to assist
               the Ministry of Information with
               certain enquiries, the nature of
               which may be ascertained on
               completion of application form
               BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this
               date, and that he is liable to
               certain obligations as specified in
               Council Order 173497, including
               financial restitutions which may or
               may not be incurred if Information
               Retrieval procedures beyond those
               incorporated in Article 7 subsections
               8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit
               information leading to permanent
               arrest - notification of which will
               he served with the time period of 5
               working days as stipulated by law. In
               that instance the detainee will be
               debited without further notice
               through central banking procedures
               without prejudice until and unless at
               such a time when re-imbursement
               procedures may be instituted by you
               or third parties on completion of a
               re-imbursement form RB/CZ/907/X ...

    ... and more of the same, most of which is part of the
    audible wall paper while the chaos reigns. As the front
    door slams behind the captive relative peace returns,
    broken by MRS BUTTLE's anguished sobbing.

                    this one of blue receipts)
                    (indicating place to sign)
               Same again please. Just there.

                    receipts)
               Press harder his time. Good.

                          MRS BUTTLE
                    (signing again)
               What is this all about?

                           OFFICIAL
                    (tearing out sheet from
                    pink book)
               That's your receipt for your husband.
                    (taking blue book from her)
               Thank you. And this is my receipt for
               your receipt.
                    (he turns to leave along
                    with troopers)

    JILL's shocked face appears looking down through the hole
    in the ceiling. The faces of the workmen BILL and CHARLIE
    also appear, above and behind her.

                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?

    The helmeted SECURITY TROOPS in Buttle's flat drop to
    defensive positions and swing their machine guns up
    towards the hole in the ceiling. All three faces retreat.
    
    
20  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           20
    
                            CHARLIE
                    (starting back from the
                    hole with Bill and Jill)
               Eh! Eh! Eh! We're Department of
               Works! Department of Works up here!
               Careful with those bloody things!
    
    JILL, CHARLIE and BILL are hustled aside by a SECURITY MAN
    who clears the fireman's pole from the hole. We can see
    the TROOPS in the room below leaving. A SECOND SECURITY
    man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window. He
    coils the rope up neatly and the TWO SECURITY MEN leave
    the flat.
    
                             BILL
                    (to Jill as they watch this
                    highly efficient operation)
               Don't take any notice, love, it's
               their training makes them like
               animals. Best in the world, though.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
                            CHARLIE
               Don't you worry love, we'll have
               everything shipshape in a jiffy.
    
                             BILL
               That's it. Nothing to worry about.
    
                            CHARLIE
               It's Buttle downstairs who can worry,
               eh?
    
                             JILL
               There must be some mistake ... Mr
               Buttle's harmless...
    
                             BILL
               We don't make mistakes.
    
    So saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with
    same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor. To
    his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the
    flat below.
                            CHARLIE
               Bloody typical, they've gone back to
               metric without telling us
               

20a INT.   BUTTLES' FLAT                     NIGHT          20a
    
    MRS BUTTLE stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
    flat. The KIDS wail. Slowly MRS BUTTLE collapses -
    slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we
    tighten into CLOSE UP of "Receipt".

                       JILL (off CAMERA)
               Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle?

21  INT.   RECORD CLERK'S POOL                               21
    
    We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT
    being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to
    reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
    desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each
    (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed
    under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
    the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk
    intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS
    bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of
    the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,
    tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is
    supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.
    Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and
    walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top
    of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.

    MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it
    behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each
    CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,
    and all the screens change to something which looks very
    like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly".

22  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             22
    
    MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his
    desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the
    console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number
    of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE
    say, "Turn around real slow, amigo". MR KURTZMAN turns
    around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his
    T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently
    flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which
    we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald". He opens the file
    and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.
    starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.
    He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash
    "Error, error, error". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.
    He presses an intercom.
                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (into intercom)
               Mr Lowry, will you step in here
               please?
               
    He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody
    comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over
    to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of
    CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
    whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in
    the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.

                          MR KURTZMAN
               Does anyone know where Lowry is?

    Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment
    later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the
    crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens
    the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.
    He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even
    more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit
    you're whupped, you drygulching scum". KURTZMAN explodes
    with anger, and presses the intercom again.

                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (Shouting into intercom)
               Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!

23  EXT.   SKY                               DAY             23
    
    CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-
    like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer
    we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood
    and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their
    flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.
    Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an
    outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI
    fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,
    banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice
    can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers,
    looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO
    face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised
    twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her
    face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly
    mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft
    billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises
    and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA
    GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that
    the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast
    landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the
    sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial
    ballet.
    
    Romantic music fills the soundtrack.
    
    SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as
    SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM
    begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy
    quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening
    rumble. SAM looks down.
    
    The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,
    monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and
    soars upwards with a mighty rush.
    
    CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into
    FRAME partially cutting her off from view.
    
    Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper
    breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another
    and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is
    being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless
    structures. And then she is finally lost from view
    somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.
    SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.
    No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with
    their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among
    these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only
    sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls
    plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound
    but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in
    this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something
    in the distance. far below him a dark procession is
    wending its way through the narrow passages... away from
    him.
    
    CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way
    past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister
    figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several
    heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal
    cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the
    cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside
    is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as
    if there were a breeze in constant attendance.
    
    CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.
    
    CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their
    tracks. They've seen something.
    
    CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between
    two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.
    
    CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.
    Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces
    are the same except for the manner in which they have
    decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly
    the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become
    long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others
    shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The
    FORCES are massed ready to charge.
    CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his
    wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.
    
    Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the
    constant dribble from their cracked mouths.

    CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.
    Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the
    fearsome horde. Unarmed!

    CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing
    madly.

    SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading
    field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time
    catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries
    a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!
    Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this
    boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing
    of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way
    through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,
    they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate
    SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way
    toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise
    behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of
    black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of
    flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces
    and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition
    emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM
    is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is
    stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks
    around - confused.

24  INT.   SAM'S BEDROOM                     MORNING         24

    TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand
    grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened
    room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.

                              SAM
               Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr
               Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is
               it?

    There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,
    incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.
    This sets of a series of other things ... The window
    shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps
    turn on in the bathroom ...

                              SAM
                    (into phone)
               The electronics here are up the
               spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry
               sir - I'll be there.

    SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
    moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is
    loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
    
    In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting
    room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a
    cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with
    SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM
    comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath
    taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-
    maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours
    a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this
    we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is
    functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been
    assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are
    built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal
    panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall
    panels have Central Services logos on them with the
    admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below. SAM has
    livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film
    posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures
    of wide beautiful vistas.

25  INT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LOBBY     DAY             25

    This is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental-style
    building. The lobby is a vast impressive space containing
    reception desks, fountains, statues etc. Prominent are the
    security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras,
    video screens and groups of SECURITY MEN who search all
    who enter. SAM is finishing going through Security when he
    meets JACK who is on his way out of the building.

                             JACK
               Sam!

                              SAM
               Jack!

                             JACK
               Long time no see!

                              SAM
               Well, since you disappeared up the
               ladder of Information Retrieval ... I
               don't expect to see you slumming in
               Records - what's the problem?

                             JACK
               Problem? - No problem - yes,
               everything's going fantastically
               well, wonderful, marvelous, great
               career prospects, Alison in great
               shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm
               on Security Level Five now, and Mr
               Helpmann relies on me more and more,
               yes, couldn't be better, I feel
               terrifically motivated and job-
               rewarded -
               
                              SAM
               You sound worried.

                             JACK
               Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,
               it's you. What happened to you, Sam?
               You were the brightest of us -

    As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit
    TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering
    the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on
    their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered
    and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM
    happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the
    over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE
    DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being
    replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where
    the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as
    she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so
    there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM
    GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK
    has been talking.

                             JACK
               What's the matter?
                               
                              SAM
               Sorry. Nothing.
                    (snapping out of it)
               See you - I'm going to be late.

                             JACK
                    (looking at his watch)
               You are late.

                              SAM
               Even later.

                             JACK
               Sam, your life is going wrong - let
               your friends tell you - Records is a
               dead end department, no Security
               Level worth a damn, it's impossible
               to get noticed -

                              SAM
               Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,
               wonderful - remember me to Alison -
               and the - er - twins.

                             JACK
               Triplets.
    
                              SAM
               Really? - God, how time flies!
    
    As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN
    standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them
    are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained
    the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
    type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the
    monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the
    Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on
    her.
    
    CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her
    hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a
    wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches
    her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in
    an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying
    to see what is written on the forms, peering over her
    shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.
    
                             JILL
               I want to report a wrongful arrest.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking at form)
               You want Information Adjustments.
               Different department.
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated but
                    controlled)
               I've been to Information Adjustments.
               They sent me here. They told me you
               had a form I had to fill in.
    
                            PORTER
               Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                            PORTER
               Is it stamped?
    
                             JILL
                    (producing Buttle receipt)
               Stamped?
    
                            PORTER
                    (examining receipt)
               No, there's no stamp on it. You see!
               I can't give you the form until it's
               stamped.
    
                             JILL
               Where do I get it stamped?
    
                            PORTER
               Information Adjustments.
    
    The radio-controlled camera noses right up to JILL's face
    as she turns. She swats the annoying thing with her stack
    of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and
    crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
    
    CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a
    deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated
    TECHNICIANS.
    
    
26  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             26
    
    SAM is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem
    while KURTZMAN looks on anxiously and ineffectually.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Perhaps the machine's on the blink!
               It keeps picking up old films. That
               can't he right, can it?
    
                              SAM
               It's not the machine. There's a
               mismatch on the personnel code
               numbers... Ah there we go! That's a
               B58/732 when it should be a T47/215
               ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06,
               debited against his account for
               electrical procedures, not Buttle.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh my God, a mistake!
    
                              SAM
               It's not our mistake!
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (eagerly)
               Isn't it? Whose is it?
    
                              SAM
               Information Retrieval.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh, good!
    
                              SAM
               Expediting has put in for electrical
               procedures in respect of Buttle,
               Archibald, shoe repair operative, but
               Security has invoiced Admin for
               Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
    
    SAM is still punching keys.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief! I don't know what I'd
               do if you ever got promoted.
    
                              SAM
               Don't worry.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               But if they did promote you
    
                              SAM
               I've told you before. I'd turn it
               down.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Would you really, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (churned up)
               You've been promoted.
    
    KURTZMAN hands SAM a sheet of printed paper. SAM takes the
    paper, not pleased, and glances at it.
    
    CLOSE UP of paper: "LOWRY, S. (RECORDS. MIN OF INF.)
    TRANSFER TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL - (Expediting, Security
    Level 3).
    
                           KURTZMAN
               It's your mother isn't it? Pulling
               strings again.
    
                              SAM
                    (explodes)
               What a BITCH!
    
    
27  INT.   DOCTOR'S OFFICE                   DAY             27
    
    CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a
    three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip
    on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on
    either side of her face. When I say several inches that's
    just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched
    like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to
    the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth
    her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over
    this freak show.
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs
               Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here
               ... and there ...
    
    CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like
    a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The
    cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised
    with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing
    table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands
    the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored
    his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It
    seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.
    There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all
    in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing
    around, raving.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I just wish you would stop
               interfering, mother! I don't want
               promotion. I'm happy where I am.
    
                            MOTHER
               No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson
               to you - he never had your brains but
               he's got the ambition. You haven't
               got the ambition but luckily you've
               got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann
               was very close -
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, Mrs Lowry, don't get upset
                    (so SAM)
               Please wait in reception, Mr Lowry,
               you're giving her wrinkles.
    
                            MOTHER
               You see!
    
                              SAM
                    (groans)
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now Mrs Lowry, try to relax. You must
               trust me. I'll make you twenty years
               younger ...
                               
                              SAM
               Huh!
                               
                            DOCTOR
                    (giving Sam a dirty look)
               ... twenty-five if we just drain the
               excess fluid from the pouches ...
    
                            MOTHER
               Dr Jaffe, you're a genius. Would you
               like to be Surgeon General? Four
               Star. I know everybody.
                               
                            DOCTOR
               Well they won't know you when I've
               finished with you.
               
    The DOCTOR reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured
    marker. He starts colouring up her face with strokes of
    different coloured markers.
    
                            DOCTOR
               First we must eliminate the excess
               derma ... so! ... Then the flaccid
               tissues under the eyes ... And now
               the forehead ... Zip! I lift the
               wrinkles and worry lines right up
               into the wi- into the hairline, comme
               ca ...
    
    SAM looks disgusted.
    
                            DOCTOR
               And now the template ... There ...
               there ... there ... Now a bit of
               sticky ... There we go!
                    (triumphantly)
               Already she is twice as beautiful as
               she was before - voila!
    
    The DOCTOR moves his body aside, revealing MRS LOWRY's
    face, covered with coloured lines and wrapped in
    cellophane held in shape by cellotape. SAM stares at her.
    
                              SAM
               My God, it works.
    
    
28  INT.   POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE)        DAY             28
    
    The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place
    while they are going through the sort of security checks
    familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the
    velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (in full flow)
               Mr Helpmann was very close to your
               poor father. He was very close to me.
               Still is. He'll take you under his
               wing at Information Retrieval. You'll
               like it when you get there.
    
                              SAM
               You're not listening, mother.
    
    A warning buzzer goes off as MOTHER's handbag goes thru
    security check. It turns out to have been activated by a
    gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it
    and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
    executive toy which we have seen twice before.
    
                            MOTHER
               It's a present for my son.
    
    She takes the toy back and hands it to SAM.
    
                            MOTHER
               I hope you like it. It's very
               exclusive.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                            MOTHER
               It's something for executives.
    
    At this point the MAITRE D arrives on the scene.
    
                           MAITRE D
               Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you
               again. Merry Christmas.
    
    He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. He
    looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite
    
                            MOTHER
               Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (blocking Sam's way)
               I'm sorry but ...
    
                            MOTHER
               You remember Samuel, my son.
    
                             SPIRO
                    {suddenly unctious)
               Oh, but of course ...
    
                            MOTHER
               We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
    
                              SAM
               Are we?
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
    
    SPIRO leads the way. SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the
    restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza
    New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,
    potted palms combine to impress us with their
    sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be
    made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate
    intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting
    across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating
    right through the middle of a particularly valuable-
    looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident
    wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their
    way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string
    quartet accompanying them.
    
    CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a
    wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking
    DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily
    distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage
    that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them
    (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are
    perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.
    
                              SAM
               Mother, I thought we were going to be
               able to talk .... Oh God, she's got
               what's he name with her.
    
    SAM and his MOTHER arrive at the table.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Ida! Sam!
    
                            MOTHER
               Alma, how are you? You're looking
               wonderful! Hello, Shirley.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (shy to Sam)
               Salt?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (to Shirley)
               Not yet.
                    (to Sam and Mother)
               Happy Christmas, Sam.
    
    She hands SAM a gaily wrapped package which obviously
    contains the same executive toy.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sorry we're late. Shall we order? Get
               it out of the way. What are you going
               to have Alma?
    
    She starts to hunt through the huge menu the MAITRE D has
    just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid
    dishes available.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               I can't make up my mind whether to
               have a number one or a number two.
               What do you recommend, Spiro?
                               
                             SPIRO

               Between you and me, Madam, today the
               number two.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are
               you going to have?

               Between you and me, Mademoiselle,
               today the number one. Madam Lowry?
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, to hell with the diet, a number
               eight, please.
    
                             SPIRO
               A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I
               may say so.
                    (to Sam)
               Monsieur?
    
                              SAM
                    (brusquely)
               A steak, please. Rare.
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, I need to ...
    
                             SPIRO
                    (piqued)
               Monsieur. Quel numero.
    
                              SAM
                    (handing back menu)
               I don't know which numero.

               Numero, trois.
    
    
    EVERYONE is a bit embarrassed here. MOTHER gives SAM a
    withering look. SPIRO stalks away.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (trying to restart things)
               Alma, you wicked thing ...
                    (indicating bandages)
               you've started your treatment.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               You noticed.
                    (enthusiastically)
               I must tell you all about it.
    
                              SAM
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, will you listen to
    
    At this moment the food arrives. SPIRO elaborately lifts
    off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the
    plates of food. Each order looks identical - a big splodge
    of brown lumpy stuff. The only differences between the
    lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in
    each. The beautiful colour photos match the photos which
    were on the menus.

                    MRS TERRAIN
               It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe
               and gone to Dr. Chapman.

                            MOTHER
               The acid man?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Really, Ida, just because his
               techniques are revolutionary ... I
               don't go around calling Dr Jaffe the
               knife man.

               I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to
               sound so ...

                          MRS TERRAIN
               That's all right Ida ... it's just
               that he's such an artist. To him,
               cutting is so crude ... so primitive.

               Acid on the other hand, can be used
               for such wonderfully subtle shading,
               such delicate nuances - just like a
               Rembrant etching ... and it's so much
               quicker. Why, if it weren't for a
               teensy-weensy complication - the
               doctor said it could have happened to
               anyone - I would have had these
               bandages off yesterday.

                            SHIRLEY
                    (to Sam, after attracting
                    her mother's attention and
                    receiving a nod)
               Salt?
    
    They are just about to dip into their respective splodges
    when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is
    blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. Chaos erupts
    around the carnage as WAITERS try putting out the flames
    with extinguishers. PEOPLE, bloody and dying, are moaning.
    The DINERS not actually affected by the blast look up for
    a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to
    their meals.
    
    IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION.

                            MOTHER
               What were we saying?
    
                              SAM
                    (picking bomb debris out of
                    his brown lump)
               This isn't rare!
    
                            MOTHER
               By the way, I saw a wonderful idea
               for Christmas presents at the
               chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift
               tokens.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh, that sounds marvellous.
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes, they're good at any doctor's and
               at many of the major hospitals - and
               they're accepted for gynecological
               complications including Caesarian
               section.
    
    SAM, in the act of taking in another forkful of his
    unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust
    
                              SAM
               Look - please - I'm sorry - but
               honestly, mother, this is -
    
                            MOTHER.
               I quite agree! - It's impossible!
    
    MOTHER raises her arm to gain the attention of the MAITRE
    D who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency.
    The activity in the background has increased throughout
    the conversation. The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens
    blaring. Ministry TROOPS have charged in and are arresting
    WAITERS. Stretchers have been bought in for the injured
    and these are being rushed past our little GROUP's table.
    The MAITRE D comes to the table, his DJ now blood-
    spattered.
    
                           MAITRE D
               I am sorry, Madam ... I don't know
               what to say ... this very rarely
               happens to us - I'll do what I can
               straight away
    
    He hurries away.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Really, Sam - when are you going to
               do something about these terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

                            MOTHER
               Actually, Alma, that's one of the
               little things I was dying to tell you
               ... Sam's been promoted to
               Information Retrieval.

                              SAM
                    (angry and surprised)
               Mother!

                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh that's wonderful! Congratulations
               Sam...

                            SHIRLEY
               You can show those fucking murderous
               bastards a thing or two.

                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (shocked and embarrassed)
               Shirley!
    
                              SAM
               Stop this!
                    (leaping to his feet)
               I'm not being promoted. I'm not going
               to Information Retrieval!
                    (he scrumples promotion
                    notification which he has
                    been holding and throws it
                    on the floor)
               If I want you to stick your oar in,
               mother, I'll tell you where to stick
               it!
    
    EVERYBODY is shocked. He recovers his composure slightly.
    Embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper
    which he starts smoothing back into Its flat state.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (back to her uncertain
                    form)
               Pepper...?
    
                              SAM
               Look - I've got to get back -
    
    As SAM goes, MAITRE D reappears with a group of WAITERS -
    those remaining unarrested - whom he has organised to gut
    up a folding screen around the table. This cuts of the
    sight if not the noise of the VICTIMS of the explosion.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
    
                              SAM
               I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I
               don't want promotion. I don't want
               anything.
    
                            MOTHER
               Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course
               you want something. You must have
               hopes, wishes, dreams.
    
    Their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to
    rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts loud)
               NO, NOTHING. NOT EVEN DREAMS!
    
29  EXT.   BRILLIANT SKY                     DAY             29
    
    SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining
    as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They
    are rising up and away from the monolithic stone
    skyscrapers that stretch away below them.
    
                              SAM
               I'm taking you to a safe place. A
               place where they will never be able
               to get at us ... ever.
    
    An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is
    but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming
    a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and
    the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent
    just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -
    about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he
    comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises
    from the centre of this bizarre place.
    
                              SAM
               There's no way they can approach us
               without being seen. You're safe here.
    
    He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his
    wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a
    terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.
    
    A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere
    beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the
    camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and
    down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is
    heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.
    All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over
    the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks
    from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at
    right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with
    a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is
    heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding
    against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid
    pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out
    from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in
    its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends
    upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky
    is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is
    frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on
    above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and
    that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after
    block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the
    light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save
    her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the
    platform but it's too late.
    
    Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of
    sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and
    out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be
    heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a
    searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The
    laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something
    black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that
    appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible
    flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.
    
    He is engulfed in the black awfulness.
    
30  INT. SAM'S BEDROOM                       NIGHT           30
    
    SAM is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. He is
    dripping with sweat and screaming. The room is
    oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.
    It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's
    stuck.
    
    CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to
    the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to
    be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the
    kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the
    window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.
    GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in
    through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and
    madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he
    tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He
    makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall
    gasping for air.
    CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back
    as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him
    dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open
    refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.
    
                              SAM
                    (into phone)

                          PHONE VOICE
               Thank you for calling Cen -
    
    SAM slams the phone down.
    
    CUT to SAM sitting in front of the refrigerator. The door
    is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a
    desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head
    slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions
    falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.

    The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are
    not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through
    space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the
    pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch
    cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the
    intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped
    and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected
    by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is
    escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM
    is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the
    tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a
    small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his
    shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way
    and SAM crashes through.
    
    CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He
    catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms
    back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on
    a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch
    he came through was the front of one of the millions of
    files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back
    into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for
    hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other
    walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is
    it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time
    Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being
    tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as
    sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.
    The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period
    costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a
    sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer
    platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the
    side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN
    (as seen on TV).
    
                             GENT
               Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
    
                              SAM
               What? How do you know my name?
    
                             GENT
               We know everything here. This is the
               Storeroom of Knowledge.
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing onto the
                    platform)
               Then perhaps you can help me. I've
               lost someone who ...
    
                             GENT
                    (interrupting)
               We know that too. You've come to the
               right place.
    
    The platform carries them along the files.
    
                             GENT
               Oh, yes. We've got everything here.
               Every bit of knowledge, wisdom,
               learning ... every experience, every
               thought neatly filed away.
    
                              SAM
                    (incredulous)
               What? You mean you've got ...
    
                             GENT
               Well not exactly. But, if you help us
               we'll help you. The Forces Of
               Darkness have won the day ... but,
               tomorrow is another one
    
                              SAM
               What do I have to do.
    
                             GENT
               You must save the day.
    
    The platform has stopped. The GENT pulls out a drawer. He
    reaches inside.
    
    The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.
    
                             GENT
               This is the Sword Of Truth ... and
               this the Helmet Of Justice.
    
    As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a
    cape.
    
                             GENT
               And this. completes the outfit.
    
    He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step
    into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs
    the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just
    like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer
    in.
    
                             GENT
               It won't be pleasant but, trust me.
    
    As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of
    claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he
    is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but
    a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM
    struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.
    
32  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           32
    
    SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the
    defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes
    up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone
    rings. He staggers over to it.
    
                              SAM
               Hello ... hello ...
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Hello. Mr Lowry?
    
                              SAM
               Who's that?
                    (pause)
    
    A sound at the kitchen door turns SAM's head - and ours -
    just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but
    then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back.
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Put the phone down and your hands up.
    
                              SAM
                    (into the phone)
               What? Who is this?
    
    SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind
    him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle-
    aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes
    suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid
    commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The
    other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is
    in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his
    feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Nice and easy now. Keep your hands
               where I can see them.
    
                              SAM
               What is this?
                    (indignantly)
               Who the hell are you?
    
    TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors,
    leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.
    
    TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At
               your service.
    
                              SAM
               Tuttle! Are you from Central
               Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Ha!!
    
                              SAM
               But ... I called Central Services.
    
                            TUTTLE
               They're a bit overworked these days.
               Luckily I intercepted your call.
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
    By now, BOTH are pouring with sweat.
    TUTTLE heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a
    wall panel.
    
                              SAM
               Wait a minute, what was that business
               with the gun?
    
    TUTTLE hands SAM the panel and plunges his arm into the
    space behind it.
    
                            TUTTLE
               A little precaution, sir. I've had
               traps set for me before now. There
               are people in Central Services who'd
               love to get their hands on Harry
               Tuttle.
    
                              SAM
               Are you saying this is illegal?
    
    By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of
    flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal
    behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and
    greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where
    that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he
    works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes
    ... BRAZIL!!
    
                            TUTTLE
               Well, yes ... and no. Officially,
               only Central Service operatives are
               supposed to touch this stuff ...
               Could you hold these.
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (he hands Sam a bunch of
                    wires that he has detached)
               ... but, with all the new rules and
               regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon
               ... they can't get decent staff any
               more ... so ... they tend to turn a
               blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.
                    (he hands Sam a torch)
               ... Mind you, if ever they could
               prove I'd been working on their
               equipment ... well, that's a
               different matter ... up a bit with
               the torch, sir.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to
               work for Central Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're
               getting warm -
    
                              SAM
               The pace?
    
                            TUTTLE
               The paperwork, couldn't stand the
               paperwork.
                    (indicating the torch)
               Over to the left please, if you don't
               mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's
               more bits of paper in Central
               Services than bits of pipe - read
               this, fill in that, hand in the other
               - listen, this old system of yours
               could be on fire and I couldn't even
               turn on the kitchen tap without
               filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody
               paperwork.
    
                              SAM
                    (mildly)
               Well I suppose one has to expect a
               certain amount
    
                            TUTTLE
               Why? I came into this game for
               adventure - go anywhere, travel
               light, get in, get out, wherever
               there's trouble, a man alone. Now
               they've got the whole country
               sectioned of and you can't move
               without a form. I'm the last of a
               breed. Ah ha! Found it!
                    (he holds up a small
                    charred gadget)
               There's your problem.
    
                              SAM
               Can you fix it?
    
                            TUTTLE
               No. But I can bypass it with one of
               these
    
    He pulls another gadget from his bag.
    
                              SAM
               Fine.
    
    The door bell. TUTTLE grabs for his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Are you expecting anyone?
    
                              SAM
               No. Wait here.
    
    He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the
    front door which he opens. He is confronted by two
    officious little men in boiler suits who are standing
    outside his door. Their names are SPOOR and DOWSER. DOWSER
    is SPOOR's echo.
    
                              SAM
               Yes?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ervices.
    
                              SAM
               Uh - what? - I ...
    
                             SPOOR
               You telephone, sir.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...elephoned sir.
    
                             SPOOR
               Trouble with your air-conditioning.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ditioning.
    
                              SAM
                    (gulps)
               No, not at all. I mean, it's all
               right. It's fixed.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed?
    
                            DOWSER
               Fixed?
    
    They don't like that.
    
                              SAM
               I mean it fixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed itself.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Machines don't fix themselves.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... fix themselves.
    
                             SPOOR
               He's tampered with it, Dowser.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ampered. with it, Spoor.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm sorry about your wasted
               journey
    
    SAM tries to close the door but SPOOR prevents this.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Dowser)
               I think we'd better have a look.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... have a look.
    
                              SAM
               No you can't.
    
    He is pushed aside. SPOOR followed by DOWSER, heads for
    the door behind which is MR TUTTLE. SAM is paralysed.
    SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous. He turns
    the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. The
    door begins to swing slowly open. SAM suddenly finds
    inspiration.
    
                              SAM
               Just a minute!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER turn round as the door continues to swing
    open. When the door is open, behind their backs TUTTLE is
    seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees
    slightly bent. TUTTLE freezes like that, pointing his
    pistol through the open door.

                              SAM
               Have you got a 27B/6?
    
    DOWSER looks very angry. Veins stand out on his forehead
    and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. SPOOR
    knocks him to the ground.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Sam)
               Now look what you've done to him.
    
                              SAM
               Have you got one or haven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
               Not ... as such ...
    
    DOWSER moans and begins to get back on his feet.
    
                             SPOOR
               But we can get one.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (worried about Dowser)
               It's all right, Terry, it's all
               right, everything's all right.
    
                              SAM
                    (ushering them to the door)
               I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a
               stickler for paper work. Where would
               we be if we didn't follow the correct
               procedures?
    
                             SPOOR
               We'll be back.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Be back.
    
                              SAM
                    (Closing the door on them)
               Thank you.
    
    SAM turns back to TUTTLE who is coming forward pocketing
    his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Thanks, Lowry, you're a good man in a
               tight corner.

    TUTTLE returns to work, fitting in the new by-pass gadget
    and tightening the nuts, and happily humming "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
               Listen .. um ... I don't want to get
               involved in any of this. But I work
               at the Ministry of Information, and I
               happen to know that Information
               Retrieval have been looking for an
               Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer.
               You wouldn't by any chance be -
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (pleased)
               My friends call me Harry. Information
               Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
    
                              SAM
               What do they want you or?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Time to go.
    
    TUTTLE finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you very much. How much will
               it...?
    
                            TUTTLE
               On the house. You did me a favor.
               Check the corridor.
    
    SAM goes to the front door, opens it and looks out.
    
                              SAM
               All clear.
    
    TUTTLE slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor.
    
                              SAM
               Hey that's a dead end.
    
    But TUTTLE merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings
    Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-
    story void to a neighboring block. SAM is amazed - not to
    say - stunned.
    
33  INT.   RECORDS POOL                      DAY             33
    
    SAM is at his desk among all the desks. Documents are
    being delivered right, left and centre through the vacuum
    tubes. All the CLERKS are busy. The screens are devoted to
    their proper use. All this activity is explained by the
    fact the MR KURTZMAN's door is wide open. At the next desk
    is another CLERK much like SAM, his NEIGHBOUR.
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               I think Kurtzman getting is
               suspicious.
    
                              SAM
               What have we got on today?
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               Casablanca.
    
    KURTZMAN appears in his doorway.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (calls out)
               Mr Lowry! Would you step in here a
               moment please.
    
    We go with KURTZMAN as he closes the office door behind
    him, we are now in ...
    
    
34  INT.   KURTZMAN'S OFFICE                 DAY             34
    
    KURTZMAN is pacing anxiously. SAM walks into the office.
    During the brief opening and closing of the door we just
    manage to hear the piano player in "Casablanca" singing,
    "... a kiss is just a kiss ...". KURTZMAN is too worried
    to notice. He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if
    it were contagious. He waves it frantically as SAM enters.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Thank God you're here! We're in
               terrible trouble! Look at this! Look
               at this!
    
    He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking the paper)
               A cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               The refund for Tuttle!
    
                              SAM
                    (startled)
               Tuttle?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion
               from the word go! He's been wrongly
               charged for Electromemorytherapy and
               someone somewhere is trying to make
               us carry the can!
    
                              SAM
               I've never seen a Ministry cheque
               before.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               We've got to get rid of it! There's
               been a balls-up somewhere, and when
               the music stops they'll jump on
               whoever's holding the cheque!
    
                              SAM
               Send it to somebody else. Send it to
               Buttle. It's his cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I've tried that! Population Census
               have got him down as dormanted, the
               Central Collective Storehouse
               computer has got him down as deleted,
               and the Information Retrieval have
               got him down as inoperative ...
               Security has him down as excised.,
               Admin have him down as completed
    
                              SAM
               Hang on.
    
    SAM sits down at the console and punches keys. He does
    this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally
    demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves KURTZMAN
    way out of his depth, until -
    
                              SAM
               He is dead.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll
               never get rid of the damned thing!
               What are we going to do?
    
                              SAM
               Try next of kin.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (a revelation)
               Next of kin!
    
    SAM punches more keys.
    
                              SAM
               There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle.
               What's the number on the cheque?
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (reading it)
               27156789/074328/K.
    
    SAM has been efficiently punching this in.
    
                              SAM
               Into memory. Now ... Central Banking
               ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit
    
    SAM rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque
    into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. A job well
    done.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (fervently)
               Please don't come back! Please don't
               come back!
    
    Unfortunately KURTZMAN's prayers are not answered and the.
    vacuum tube returns almost immediately. SAM opens it up.
    From the computer screen comes a voice "Play it again,
    Sam" - SAM and KURTZMAN look at the screen. We get a quick
    glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to
    numbers.
    
                              SAM
               Problem. She doesn't have a bank
               account.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Well, that's it! I may as well go and
               hang myself! This sort of thing
               couldn't have happened before the
               stupid seventh tier reorganization!
               That was Simmons doing! And he and
               Jeffries always sit together at
               lunch! The bastards!
                    (he thumps his hand hard on
                    the desk top)
               Ow!
                    (He picks up the offending
                    cheque)
               Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the
               filing cabinet ... or destroy it ...
               burn it ... eat it ...
    
    Under this tirade SAM has begun to hum "BRAZIL" - not
    entirely sure what inspired him.
    
                              SAM
               You'd never get away with it.
               Besides, you can't do that to
               somebody's refund. It's Christmas.
               There is one more option.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (depressed. Not really
                    believing it)
               What?
    
                              SAM
               Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the
               cheque, tell her to sign her name on
               the back, cash it at the corner sweet
               shop.
    
    KURTZMAN is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               That's brilliant!
    
    SAM takes over. In no time at all he has battered away at
    the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and
    received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf
    of different coloured papers.
    
                              SAM
               I'll do it for you. Authorise the
               cheque. What's the address?
    
    KURTZMAN scribbles it down for him.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Here. What do I do next?
    
                              SAM
               Call the motor pool and authorise
               personal transport.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Of course, of course. Leave it to me.
               How do I authorize a cheque?
    
                              SAM
                    (separating the and blue
                    sheets)
               Here we are. Pink and blue receipts.
               All you've got to do is sign these
               and the back of the cheque.
    
    KURTZMAN takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers
    but his hand is giving him trouble.
    

                           KURTZMAN
                    (exhausted after all the
                    emotion)
               Oh God! I think I've broken a bone.
               What a pathetic thing I am.

                              SAM
               (taking the pen from him)
               Here.

    SAM signs the cheque and receipts. A big CLOSE UP shows
    that he is scribbling KURTZMAN's signature. SAM pockets
    the papers and the pen.

                              SAM
               That's it.

                           KURTZMAN
               You are good to me Sam.

                              SAM
                    (leaving)
               Don't mention it. See you later.

35  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             35
    CUT to SAM at the wheel of the little car, beetling along
    in a seemingly endless, tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and
    aft by huge buses, lorries and other carriers which
    literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road
    surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck.
    
    CUT to SAM in interior of the Messerschmidt. He is singing
    along to an obscure arrangement of "BRAZIL".
    
                             RADIO
                    (plays music for a moment
                    which then fades out)
               ... We interrupt this programme to
               bring you news of a terrorist bombing
               at the ...
                    (Sam switches off)
    
    
36  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             36
    
    CUT to exterior view of Messerschmidt still merrily
    progressing in arterial tunnel. CUT to very tiny exit
    sign: Exit 49.
    
    CUT to SAM peering at sign.
    
    CUT to Messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry
    roars by.
    
    
37  EXT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             37
    
    Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
    sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's
    model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
    of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -
    graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the
    background is the grim reality of the massive housing
    tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow
    of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge
    conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out
    of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a
    few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then
    at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit
    pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.
    
                              SAM
                    (super polite)
               Excuse me. Can you tell me ...
    
    But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.
    
                              KID
               Eff off.
    
    SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.
    
    He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the
    little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of
    the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the
    car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.
    
    
38  INT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             38
    
    CUT to SAM hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby
    of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in
    evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the
    button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the
    lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors
    apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them -
    still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM
    can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old
    furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns
    towards the stairs.
    
    
39  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             39
    CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On
    the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the
    corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but
    then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to
    knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles
    for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.
    
               SAM
               Mrs Buttle
                    (silence)
               Uh, Mrs Buttle?
                    (silence)
    
    SAM stands not knowing what to do.
    SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts
    about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat.
    CUT to SAM's POV of darkish hall.
    
                              SAM
               Mrs Buttle ...
    
40  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING ROOM               DAY             40
    
    CUT to SAM entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded
    in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the
    FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is
    still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting
    absolutely still at a small table by the only (still
    broken) window in the room.
    
                              SAM
               Are you Mrs Buttle?
    
    The WOMAN nods very slightly without looking at him.
    
                              SAM
               My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm
               from the Ministry of Information.
                    (no response)
               I've come to give you a cheque.
    
    SAM takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the
    table to tempt MRS BUTTLE into a flicker of interest but
    she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. SAM
    pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she
    does not respond.
    
                              SAM
                    (indicting cheque)
               It's a refund ... I'm afraid there
               was a mistake.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               Mistake?
    
                              SAM
                    (encouraged)
               Yes. Not my department ... I'm only
               records. It seems that Mr Buttle was
               overcharged by Information Retrieval.
               I don't think they usually make
               mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose
               we're all human.
    
    SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
    
               Oh ... what happened to the ...?
    
    He gets nothing back.
    
               Actually, my bringing this here is
               rather unorthodox ... Usually any
               payments are made through the central
               computer ... but, er ... there were
               certain difficulties, and rather than
               cause delay, we thought you might
               appreciate this now ... it being
               Christmas.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               My husband's dead, isn't he?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the
               Ministry is always very scrupulous
               about following up and eradicating
               error. If you have any complaints
               which you'd like to make, I'd be more
               than happy to send you the
               appropriate forms.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               What have you done with his body?
    
                              SAM
               Um ...
    
    MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
               I don't know anything about it ...
               I'm really just delivering the
               cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind
               signing these receipts
                    (producing blue and pink
                    receipts)
               I'll go and leave you in peace.
    
    SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE
    together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and
    throws them in his face.
    
                              SAM
               Uh ...
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               He hadn't done anything ... He was
               good ... What have you done with his
               body?
    
    SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE
    standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a
    blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at
    SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the
    wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the
    floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his
    hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull
    the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on
    his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and
    shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the
    BOY.
    
    From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the
    floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's
    head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is
    unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems
    unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of
    mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.
    
                             JILL
               Are you alright?
    
                              SAM
                    (mumbles)
               It's you ... it's you ...
    
                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
    
    SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the
    angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the
    vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to
    realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,
    dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the
    ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only
    the empty space of the hole.
    
                              SAM
               Wait! Stop! Come back!!
    
    MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.
    
    
41  INT.   BUTTLE'S CORRIDOR                 DAY             41
    
    SAM looks both ways and heads for the stairs.
    
    
42  INT.   BUTTLE'S STAIRCASE                DAY             42
    
    SAM runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds
    himself in -
    
    
43  EXT.   SIMILAR CORRIDOR                  DAY             43
    
    He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the
    doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock
    at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is
    the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the
    door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at
    him.
    
                              SAM
               Girl ... fair hair ...
    
    The door shuts firmly. SAM rushes to the next door.
    
    
44  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       DAY             44
    
    SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the
    floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and
    looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is
    apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is
    carrying a suitcase and bundles.
    
    
45  INT.   STAIRCASE                         DAY             45
    
    SAM rushes down the stairs.
    
    
46  EXT.   BLOCK OF FLATS                    DAY             46
    
    SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared.
    The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know
    which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the
    building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
    attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch
    him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry
    comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at
    the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouting)
               Wait! It was nothing to do with me!
    
    The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering
    three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up.
    He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all
    three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair
    and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him
    expressionlessly.
    
    They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.
    
    Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A
    shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL
    BUTTLE standing over him.
    
                              SAM
               Go away.
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Her name is Jill.
    
                              SAM
               What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Layton.
    
                              SAM
               Jill Layton ...
                    (getting up)
               You're a very good little girl. What
               are you doing here?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               I'm waiting for my daddy.
    
                              SAM
                    (uncomprehending)
               He will be pleased when he comes
               home.
    
    GIRL BUTTLE doesn't answer and SAM starts to walk away.
    After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back
    to look at the little GIRL BUTTLE who stands alone
    patiently in the vandalised wilderness.
    
    
47  INT.   RECORD CLERKS POOL                DAY             47
    
    It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily
    getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last
    one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with
    his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He
    sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his
    computer console. Totally absorbed in what he is doing.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh ... Sam. I've had the transport
               pool onto me ... You don't know
               anything about a personnel
               transporter gone missing do you?
    
    SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a
    front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code
    number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up
    personal dossier information like "age", "height",
    "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes",
    "distinguishing marks" etc.
    
                              SAM
                    (preoccupied)
               A "personnel" transporter? They've
               got it wrong. I had a personal
               transporter. I'll do the paperwork
               tomorrow -
    
    SAM punches up a few more categories for JILL's dossier.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's
               cheque?
    
                              SAM
               I delivered it.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Can I forget it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
    SAM punches a few more buttons on the computer.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief!
                    (on reflection)
               I shall probably have nightmares.
    
    At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself
    over most of the screen and "IRQ/3" starts agitating at
    the bottom
    
                              SAM
               Damn! Blast!
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What's the matter?
    
                              SAM
               You don't happen to know how I can
               get around an IRQ/3 do you?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All information on 3rd Level Suspects
               is classified.
    
                              SAM
               I know that.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All enquiries to Information
               Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of
               course. They never tell you anything.
               But come the time they want something
               from us ...
    
    Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching
    keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches
    in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view
    computer portrait rolls out as SAM ponders his options.
    
                              SAM
                    (cutting off Kurtzman)
               I've go to accept that promotion to
               get behind this, haven't I?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Yes.
                    (realising what he's
                    suggesting)
               NO! You can't! You've only just
               turned it down!
                    (thinking Sam is joking)
    
                              SAM
               I never signed the form.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I did it for you.
    
                              SAM
               What! Shit!
               
                           KURTZMAN
               It's what you wanted isn't it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
    
    KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He
    grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Come on, before they turn the lights
               out.
    
    SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and
    follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some
    distance away, and before they get there all the lights go
    out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.
    
    
48  INT.   TRANSPORT CAGE                    EVENING         48
    
    Packed tightly between other passengers SAM is busy
    drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer
    print-out of JILL turning her into the DREAM GIRL. The
    transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a
    tower block.
    
    
49  INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    EVENING         49
    
    The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end
    of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for
    various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get
    off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he.
    Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about
    something he heads for his own front door.
    
    
50  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        EVENING         50
    
    SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing
    panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown
    mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
    disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying
    to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring
    plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is
    not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
    banging going on somewhere behind the wall.
    
                              SAM
               What the - ? How did you - ?
    
                             SPOOR
               Emergency procedures.
    
                         DOWSER (O.S.)
                    (muffled)
               ...ergency procedures.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I haven't got an emergency. Get out
               of here.
    
    For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
    and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central
    Services, claiming "an emergency". SPOOR shuts off his
    machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what
    looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper
    between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here please.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (surprised)
               It's a 27B/6, what did you think it
               was?
    
    SAM takes out KURTZMAN's old-fashioned fountain pen from
    his pocket, signs where indicated. SPOOR registers that
    SAM's signature has hardly penetrated through he first
    carbon let alone the other 43
    
                             SPOOR
                    (sourly)
               Haven't you got a ballpoint?
    
    SAM resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by
    one. SPOOR realises that DOWSER's echo has gone missing.
    
                             SPOOR
               Now where's he got to?
                    (shouts)
               Dowser!
    
    DOWSER bursts through a panel in the wall. This is the
    panel which TUTTLE had removed and replaced. A few of the
    flat's intestines have come out with DOWSER. DOWSER has
    made a find - TUTTLE's spare part.
    
                             SPOOR
               What have you got there?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (highly excited)
               Got there!
    
    DOWSER points to TUTTLE's spare part which is hanging out
    of the wall attached to rubber tube. SPOOR examines this
    closely. SAM watches alarmed. The TWO MEN go into a
    mumbling huddle.
    
                             SPOOR
               Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ...
               Tuttle
    
                            DOWSER
               Mumble ... Tuttle ...
    
                             SPOOR
               Tuttle! ... mumble!
                    (to Sam)
               You've had that scab Tuttle here,
               haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...aven't you?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             SPOOR
               Who fixed your ducts?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...your ducts?
    
                              SAM
               I fixed it myself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh
                    (he holds up Tuttle's spare
                    part)
               out yer nostril?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Yer nostril?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services don't take kindly to
               sabotage!
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sabotage!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER and the other workmen gather up their
    tools - put them in the bag, grab everything else that
    belongs to them and are leaving. SPOOR grabs the form-book
    out of SAM's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that
    page at SAM, shoves the book into his bag. The WORKMEN
    begin leaving the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't
               just go and leave it like this!
    
                             SPOOR
                    (mock innocent)
               Why not? All you've got to do is blow
               yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (leaving)
               You're putting your talents to very
               odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to
               pit wits against Central Services -
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sod you, stupid twit.
    
    They go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving SAM in the
    ruins of his flat.
    
    SAM stands in the maimed sitting-room. Wall panels are
    off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room
    like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a
    couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently
    hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the
    print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the
    DREAM GIRL.
    
    
51  EXT.   CONDUIT FOREST                    NIGHT           51
    
    DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to
    reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest
    of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through
    the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.
    Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering
    before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke
    and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.
    
    
52  EXT.   CLOUDS                            NIGHT           52
    
    CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape
    twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it
    clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape
    up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out
    until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.
    Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.
    
    
53  EXT.   STRANGE LANDSCAPE                 ANTI-DAY        53
    
    SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange
    mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the
    occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long
    lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant
    cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The
    black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the
    PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.
    The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.
    The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a
    black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.
    
    CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards
    the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,
    destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them
    forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a
    stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear
    raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS
    turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -
    a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We
    see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is
    MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and
    the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.
    A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the
    sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.
    But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins
    to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a
    mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and
    the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the
    opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black
    flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high
    into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into
    the light. There, under several meters of the earth's
    crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful
    blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen
    in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the
    crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet
    high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient
    Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he
    made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a
    horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that
    was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of
    Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is
    unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being
    loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face
    the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands
    ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in
    an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does
    the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees
    that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter
    from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the
    ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the
    ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black
    flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the
    trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is
    severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking
    around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned
    cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and
    begins chopping the tethers away.
    The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last
    restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but
    before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg
    halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is
    caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.
    Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the
    smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The
    face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to
    the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.
    
                   MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND
               Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what
               she seems.
    
    SAM kicks and strains but the hands hold firm.
    
    
54  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           54
    
    SAM wakes up. His feet are entangled in some wiring and
    ducting. He is still in his devastated sitting room. As he
    untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment
    for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and
    still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the
    door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly
    bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and
    big-bowed tap dancing shoes. She launches into a terrible
    song and dance routine.
    
                        GIRL (singing)
               Mrs Ida Lowry requests the pleasure
                 of your companyyyy
                 at her apartment tonight,
               from eight thirtyyyy
                 midnight
               to celebrate the completion
                 of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy
               The guest of honour will be
                 Mr Conrad Helpmann,
               Dep. Under Minister of State
                 for Public Information,
               R.S.V.P. by singing telegram.
    
    SAM and the GIRL stand looking at each other uneasily for
    a moment.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... Thanks ...
    
                             GIRL
               It's reply paid.
    
                              SAM
               Oh ...
                    (he sings uncertainly)
               Thank you very much, mother, but
               actually -
    
                             GIRL
               You don't have to sing it.
    
                              SAM
               Oh, right ...
    
    The GIRL begins to dance again - but this time in a rather
    strange strangled fashion.
    
                              SAM
                    (he looks at his watch)
               Aren't you a bit late? - the party
               started half an hour ago.
    
                             GIRL
               Yes, I know. It's the backlog,
               everybody complains. Was it all right
               otherwise?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank
               you.
    
                             GIRL
               Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
    
    
55  INT.   MOTHER' S CORRIDOR                NIGHT           55
    
    SAM rings the doorbell to his mother's flat. He is
    wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his
    only dress outfit. The door is opened by a LIVERIED FLUNKY
    who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old
    woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses SAM
    over the threshold.
    
                             WOMAN
               Sam, I'm so glad you came. Do come
               in.
    
    
56  INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT           56
    
    SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.
    The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less
    formally dresses than SAM. It is an elegant baroque room -
    lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous
    Central Service ducts that thrust through antique
    tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for
    aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.
    
                              SAM
                    (bewildered)
               Mother? Is that you?
    
                            MOTHER
                    (taking his arm - looking
                    slightly askance at his
                    clothes)
               Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The
               bandages came of this afternoon. Come
               and join the fun. Everybody's here.
    
                              SAM
               Is Mr Helpmann here?
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
    
                              SAM
               I want to talk to him.
    
    SAM pushes away the FLUNKY who is by now passing a metal
    detector over him.
    
                            MOTHER
               It seems you're the first person ever
               to turn down a promotion. He thinks
               you should see a doctor.
    
                              SAM
               Actually, I've decided ...
    
    DR JAFFE hoves into view.
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, Louis! You know Sam.
    
    DR JAFFE is no longer suave. He has been transformed by
    drink and success. Mostly by drink.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (as high as a kite)
               Can you believe it?! Just me and my
               little knife! Snip - snip - slice -
               slice - Can you believe it?
    
                              SAM
                    (repelled)
               Congratulations ...
    
                           DR JAFFE
               And this is just the beginning!!
    
                              SAM
               Really?
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Chirst yes, you've seen her with her
               clothes off. Faces are a doddle
               compared to tits and arse.
                    (explains)
               No hairline.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (primly)
               Really, Louis.
    
    A handsome young piece of BEEFCAKE delivers a drink to
    MOTHER.
    
                           BEEFCAKE
               I've been looking everywhere for you,
               Ida.
    
    The BEEFCAKE takes MOTHER away.
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Ah, dear boy ... And what do you
               think of your mother now?
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               It will never last.
    
    SAM and DR JAFFE turn to see who is speaking. It is DR
    CHAPMAN a tall, pipe-smoking, professional-looking gent.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (a trifle haughtily)
               Excuse me, Dr Chapman, did you say
               something?
    
                          DR CHAPMAN
               That technique ... I've tried it. A
               nice effect. But highly unstable. In
               six months she'll look like Grandma
               Moses.
    
    SAM wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but
    suddenly freezes - the reflection in the large wall mirror
    next to him is not that of the party guests - but of the
    GREY PRISONERS in his dream - they are massed in the room
    looking pleadingly towards him.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (unsuave again)
               Now see here, Chapman. At least mine
               don't look like they've been mugged.
    
    Through the GREY PRISONERS pushes MRS TERRAIN.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (calls)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns around to see her pushing through the party
    guests.
    
    MRS TERRAIN is limping and is even more heavily swathed in
    bandages than the last time.
    
    DR CHAPMAN hastily moves away as MRS TERRAIN comes up. She
    claims SAM, taking his arm.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at her worriedly)
               Whatever happened to you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               There was a slight complication. Dr.
               Chapman says it often happens with a
               delicate skin like mine. Nothing to
               worry about. He's promised me I'll
               have these bandages off in a ...
                               
                              SAM
                    (trying to disengage)
               Actually, there's someone I want to
               meet ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (roguishly)
               I know, I know ...!
               
    She drags SAM through the party and we arrive at her
    daughter, SHIRLEY, who is, of course, a wallflower.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Here we are! I'm going to leave you
               two lovebirds in peace.
    
                              SAM
               I ... uh ...
    
    But he is alone with SHIRLEY, standing at the entrance to
    his MOTHER's embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom.
    In amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed
    MOTHER is playing hide and seek with a YOUNG STUD.
    
                              SAM
               Can I get you a drink, Shirley?
    
    SHIRLEY looks at him terrified.
    
                              SAM
               Look ... Shirley ... your mother ...
               and my mother ... they seem to have
               got the idea ... I mean, I'm terribly
               flattered, of course, but, um, the
               thing is, I don't want you to be
               under any false ...
                               
                            SHIRLEY
                    {struggling into speech
                    shyly)
               It's ... it's ... all right ... I
               don't like you either ...
    
    This isn't what SAM expected. He smiles weakly at her.
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns round, to see JACK LINT a few paces away.
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               You remember Alison?
    
    He indicates his cute blonde perfect junior executive's
    WIFE
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Alison. You look different.
    
                            ALISON
               Well, I'm two years older.
    
                             JACK
               And she's been to Dr. Jaffe!
    
    ALISON locks displeased.
    
                             JACK
                    {winking at Sam)
               She doesn't like me telling anyone
               but she's pleased as anything really.
    
                              SAM
               Er, I knew you looked different.
                               
                             JACK
               Remember how they used to stick out?
    
                              SAM
               What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to
               wonder if they were real.
    
                            ALISON
               What, my ears?
    
                              SAM
               Your ears?
    
                             JACK
               Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
    
                              SAM
                    (covering up hopelessly)
               Quite, absolutely - I always thought
               they were false.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking past Sam)
               Mr Helpmann!
    
    SAM spins round and sees a very pleasant-looking
    distinguished OLD MAN moving in their direction. He is in
    a wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Hello, Jack.
    
                             JACK
               You remember my wife ... Alis -
    
                           HELPMANN
               Of course. Barbara isn't it? How are
               you?
                            ALISON
               Um ...
    
                             JACK
                    (instantly. Conveying to
                    Alison that she mustn't
                    object)
               Barbara's very well, thank you, sir.
               How are you?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Fine, thank you. Hello, Sam. Ida said
               you might be here. Have you got a
               minute?
                    (to Jack)
               Would you excuse us?
    
    JACK is taken aback, envious and eager to please.
    
                             JACK
               Of course .... of course ... Come on
               Alison - Barbara
    
    JACK propels his WIFE away.
    
    HELPMANN I need your help, Sam.
    
    
57  INT.   BATHROOM                          NIGHT           57
    
    It's the sort of bathroom you would expect of MOTHER, an
    adjunct to her boudoir. The pink or purple lavatory is in
    the process of flushing, while SAM holds MR HELPMANN
    vertical, grasping him under the armpits, while MR
    HELPMANN is zipping his fly.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Thanks very much Sam.
    
                              SAM
               That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to
               help.
    
    He is lowering HELPMANN into the wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               If I can help you ...
    
                              SAM
                    (broaching the subject)
               Well, I ...
    
    In maneuvering HELPMANN SAM clumsily knocks over one of
    the pretty pots which fussily decorate MOTHER's bathroom
    shelf. A thin layer of powder is spread over the wash-
    stand.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry ...
    
                           HELPMANN
               Your father and I were very close. Of
               course Jeremiah was senior to me but
               we were close friends ... especially
               after the bombing
                    (he indicates his legs)
               and I
                    (chuckles)
               keep his name alive at the office
               every day.
    
    With his finger HELPMANN is tracing letters in the
    powdered surface.
    
                           HELPMANN
               It's as though he's there speaking to
               me - "'ere I am, J.H.!" The ghost in
               the machine.
    
    We see that HELPMANN has traced the letters EREIAMJH in
    the powder.
    
                           HELPMANN
               I know he would have wanted me to
               help you ... And I promised your
               mother I'd take you onto the team at
               information Retrieval. But I gather
               that ...
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind.
               I'd like to accept the transfer - am
               I too late?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Too late? That's for me to say.
                               
                              SAM
               Well ... well, I ...
    
    HELPMANN puts out his hand. SAM takes it.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Welcome to Information Retrieval!
    
    HELPMANN blows away the spilled powder and EREIAMJH with
    it.
    
Scene 58 deleted                               Scene 58 deleted

59  INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         DAY             59
    
    CUT to WIDE SHOT of massive imposing lobby - much like the
    Records lobby - but this one is very austere. No crowds.
    No statues. No decoration. Not even the ever-present
    security checks. Impressive. And a bit unnerving. Framed
    in the doorway is a lone TINY FIGURE. CUT to CLOSE UP.
    It's SAM. He hesitates and then enters. CUT to video
    screen. The video camera follows SAM across the lobby -
    til he stops in tight profile at Reception Desk. We tilt
    up revealing SAM standing facing us just beyond the
    monitor which is on the desk.
    
                              SAM
                    (diffidently to the porter)
               My name is Sam Lowry. I have to
               report to Mr Warren.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking down his nose at
                    Sam's unsleek clerk's suit
                    and then handing him an
                    I.D. badge)
               Thirtieth floor, sir. You're
               expected.
    
                              SAM
               Er, don't you want to search me?
    
                            PORTER
               No, sir.
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback. Reaching into
                    his pocket)
               My I.D. cards.
    
                            PORTER
               No need, sir
    
                              SAM
                    (nonplussed)
               But I could be anybody.
    
                            PORTER
               No you couldn't, sir. This is
               Information Retrieval.
                    (indicating to the right)
               the lift's arrived, sir.
    
    
60  INT.   30TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             60
    
    SAM steps out of the lift.The lift doors close. SAM looks
    up and down the corridor hearing nothing. Silence. Then
    he, and we, begin to hear a sound. It is a curious
    whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be
    growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into
    view around a corner at the far end of the rather long
    corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a
    magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This
    is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are
    competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of
    sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied
    EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals,
    disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors
    which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't
    get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other
    doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming
    by SAM at the rate of knots. The sound it makes breaks
    down into something like this.
    
                          EXPEDITER 1
                    (waving pager)
               Mr Warren, this order ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 2
                    (waving same)
               Mr Warren ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 3
                    (ditto)
               About this invoice ... Victim's list
               ...
    
                            WARREN
                    (dealing on all sides)
               Yes ... No ... send that back ...
               wrong department ... of course ... of
               course not ... yes ... no ... maybe.
    
    CUT to SAM watching this caravanserai with awe as it
    starts pass him.
    
                          EXPEDITER 4
               ... about these requisitions ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 5
               Mr Warren ... EX/27 has 15 suspects
               still outstanding.
    
                          EXPEDITER 6
               ... a decision, Mr Warren ...
    
                            WARREN
               ... cancel that ... okay ... put half
               as terrorists, the rest as victims
               ... yes ... yes ... no ... definitely
               no ...
    
    SAM doesn't have the nerve to jump into this. The scrum
    sweeps by and fades away along the corridor, and finally
    disappearing around the corner at the other end. SAM
    follows. Silence has descended again.
    
    
61  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             61
    
    SAM gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar
    corridor at right angles. He hesitates and continues. Then
    he starts to hear the sound again. It is coming up from
    behind. MR WARREN has circumnavigated the building. The
    same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace.
    As the scrum reaches SAM he gathers his nerve and jumps
    right in beside WARREN, and keeps going.
    
                              SAM
                    (in a hurry)
               I'm Lowry, Mr Warren ... Sam Lowry.
    
                            WARREN
                    (putting arm around Sam)
               Ah. Lowry ... yes.
                    (still dealing with
                    Expediters)
               ... no, cancel that ... glad to have
               you aboard ... yes ... no ... don't
               be ridiculous Jenkins ... Yes, yes,
               yes ... you'll like it up here ...
               send that back ... we've got a crack
               team of ... are they kidding? ...
               decision makers ... No, in triplicate
               ... I'm expecting big things ... two
               copies to Finance ... of you ... send
               that to Security ... uh, uh, uh.
                    (poring over forms)
               Uh, don't let Progress see this ...
               between you and me, Lowry, this ...
               no, no ... department ... tell
               Records to get stuffed ... is about
               to be upgraded and ...
    
    WARREN suddenly pivots around, swinging SAM 240 degrees in
    the direction they came from plus a bit.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, here we are!
                    (they are standing facing a
                    door - one of the hundreds
                    of identical doors lining
                    these corridors)
               What do you think?
    
    The door says: OFFICER DZ/015.
    
    SAM has no idea what he ought to say.
    
                            WARREN
                    (solemnly)
               Your very own number... on your very
               own door ... and behind that door
                    (he turns the knob and
                    opens the door)
               ... your very own office.
               Congratulations, DZ/015, welcome to
               the team.
    
    WARREN whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and EXPEDITERS
    leaving SAM standing dumfounded at the entrance to his
    office.
    
    CUT to SAM's POV of the office. It is about four feet
    wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is
    bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side
    wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which
    is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang
    from the ceiling. SAM slowly enters the room.
    
    
62  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             62
    
    SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to
    begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes
    in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
    starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. There in his
    "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -
    gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &
    Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up
    his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)
    against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM
    turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they
    both fall over with a "plop". Puzzled, he stands the books
    up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". Same result.
    Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before
    his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,
    and "plop", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold
    of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the
    wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,
    somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly
    pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.
    Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for
    the door.
    
    
63  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             63
    
    Cut to SAM coming out of his office, turning right and
    walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads:
    OFFICER DV/048.
    
    As is his custom, SAM opens the door without knocking.
    
    
63a INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY            63a
    
    CUT to SAM'S POV. Here is an office much like his. It's
    the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall.
    The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking,
    round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with
    trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. He
    is unaware of SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Hello.
    
    LIME startled, lets go of his desk and vents his
    irritation on SAM whom he mistakes for someone else.
    
                             LIME
               No, you can't have any more chairs!
               There's only one left in here now,
               and I need that to sit on!
                    (realizing his mistake)
               Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
    
                              SAM
               Sam Lowry.
    
                             LIME
                    (becoming unctuous)
               Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next
               door, ha ha!
                    (he advances toward Sam
                    with hand out to shake.
                    Shaking hands)
               My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome
               to Expediting.
    
                              SAM
               Ah.
                    (he pauses - looking
                    around)
               Would you mind if I borrowed your
               computer console?
    
                             LIME
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
    
                             LIME
               You want to take my console into your
               office?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
                             LIME
                    (after a moment's
                    consideration)
               I'll tell you what .... You tell me
               what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of
               a whizz on this thing.
                    (indicates computer
                    console)
    
    SAM hesitates, but sees that there's no other way.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out on Jill
                    from his pocket)
               Alright. There's someone I want to
               check out. A woman called Gillian
               Layton.
    
                             LIME
                    (leering)
               A woman eh? I see.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to ignore this)
               I know her age and distinguishing
               marks. But I need an address or a
               place of work or something
    
                             LIME
                    (continuing to leer)
               This is your dream girl, is it?
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback)
               What?
                    (recovering)
               Look, let me use the console for a
               few minutes.
    
                             LIME
                    (trying to be jocular)
               You must be joking -
                    (entirely unconvincing)
               When there's a woman involved -
               there's no stopping me. Now, let me
               have that sheet.
    
    He takes Jill's print-out sheet from SAM and begins to
    punch the keys laboriously with one finger. Nothing
    happens.
    
                             LIME
               Sod it, it's broken!
    
                              SAM
               You haven't switched it on.
    
                             LIME
               Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off,
               standing there! Go back to your
               office and I'll give you a knock when
               I've finished.
    
    SAM hesitates, but goes.
    
                             LIME
               Go on. I'm not going to elope with
               her.
    
    SAM exits.
    
    
64  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             64
    
    SAM is sitting in his office listening to the protracted
    one finger exercise which is going on next door. He stares
    dumbly at the shining, absolutely useless, executive toy.
    
    
65  EXT.   ICY SEA                           ANTI-DAY        65
    
    The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV
    as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
    wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.
    
    As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
    heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer
    still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.
    Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,
    but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a
    massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is
    engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the
    ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after
    course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we
    continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is
    looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an
    opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts
    out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and
    managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing
    thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark
    passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself
    teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull
    and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs
    curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow
    shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks
    and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM
    gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but
    his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far
    below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of
    grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks
    and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back
    and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the
    ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another
    boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as
    the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches
    at the wall.
    
    
66  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY            66
    
    SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The
    boom repeats. LIME is knocking on the other side. SAM
    leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the
    desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.
    
67  INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY             67
    SAM enters. LIME is standing, proudly holding out a sheet
    of paper.
    
                             LIME
               Computers are my forte.
    
                              SAM
                    (reading)
               Gillian Layton, age twenty three,
               eyes, blue, hair, black, weight, one
               hundred and twenty-one pounds,
               distinguishing marks, blemish on
               right shoulder, scar on left elbow
    
    He stops, having come to the end. He looks at the other
    side of the paper but there's nothing there.
    
    Is this all you got?
    
                             LIME
               It's a start isn't it.
                              SAM
                    (disbelieving)
               But I already knew this!
               
                             LIME
               Best to take it slowly where some
               women are concerned.
    
    SAM sits on LIME's chair and deftly punches the computer
    keys.
    
                             LIME
               Hey - that's my desk!
    
                              SAM
                    (working quickly)
               Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173.
               Truck driver! All enquiries,
               reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.
                    (switching off the machine
                    and getting up)
               That's what I wanted to know. Thank
               you very much.
    
    
68  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            68
    
    SAM heads off down corridor. WARREN & CO. appear.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you ...
                    (he continues to deal with
                    expediters in between
                    dealing with Sam)
               No, send it back for ... Are you
               settling down? ... I want this order
               rescinded ... There's a query on a
               personnel transporter you took out
               from the pool ... Tell them no, tell
               them yes, ... or was it a personnel
               carrier you took out from
               transportation ... Send that up to
               Security ... Some kind of eight-wheel-
               half-track, was it? ... Tell him I
               want to see him ... Send round the
               paperwork, Lowry ... Arrange a
               conference on that one ... Anyway,
               tidy it up, Lowry, there's a good
               chap - get a new suit. Did you want
               the lift?
    
    The cavalcade is passing the lifts. SAM backs away into
    the open lift. The cavalcade passes on out of sight. The
    lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop. She
    remains in the lift as SAM joins her.
    
    
69  INT.   THE LIFT                          69
    
    SAM presses the button for the 50th floor. The lift doors
    close on him and the CHARLADY. From somewhere far away
    there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances
    around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning
    vent in the ceiling.
    
    SAM glances enquiringly at the CHARLADY who merely smiles
    at him. Another scream is heard.
    
                              SAM
               What's that?
    
    The CHARLADY smiles again.
    
               Doesn't that disturb you?
    
    The CHARLADY fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
    out a pair of wax earplugs.
    
                           CHARLADY
               Beg your pardon?
    
    The lift arrives.
    
    
70  INT.   50TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             70
    
    The lift arrives. SAM steps out. The CHARLADY remains in
    the lift. The doors close. SAM heads down surgically clean
    white-tiled corridor.
    
    Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears
    to be electric meters, SAM comes to a door with 5001.
    Above the door a red light is glowing. SAM knocks. The red
    light goes out and a green light comes on. SAM enters.
    
    
71  INT.   ROOM 500l                         DAY             71
    
    Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
    the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-
    looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and
    typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who,
    busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently
    mouths the words ...
    
                            TYPIST
               It won't be long now.
                    (she carries on typing)
                    
    SAM nods, and stands quietly by her. He can hear tiny
    sounds coming through her headphones. He looks down at the
    piece of paper in the typewriter. He reacts a bit
    strangely, perhaps even winces. We see he close up of the
    words being struck crisply on paper.
    
                         ON TYPEWRITER
               AHHHH, Oh God ... No, don't ... UHH,
               please ... I ... STOP!! I can't stand
               ... AIIEEEE.
    
                            TYPIST
                    (quietly, still typing)
               Can I help you?
    
    She is looking at SAM helpfully, holding one of the
    earphones away from her ear. From this earphone we can
    just hear quietly ...
    
                           EARPHONE
               Oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...
               arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... Oh God,
               No ... No, stop, I don't know ...
    
                              SAM
               I'm looking for Officer 412/L.
    
    The TYPIST nods smiling. She puts back the earphone and
    carries on typing.
    
                            TYPIST
               I'm sure he won't be long now.
    
    She types a little more but suddenly stops.
    
                         I thought so!
    
    She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
    carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
    the different copies.
    
    Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,
    SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn
    left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits
    from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them,
    a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.
    
                            TYPIST
               You can go in now.
    
    
72  INT.   JACK'S OFFICE                     DAY            72
    
    SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open
    the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise
    from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the
    left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk
    with a large collection of executive toys and other
    tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
    rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall
    of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from
    entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently
    successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the
    wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval
    TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with
    old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?
    
    The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He
    continues vibrating his temples.
    
                              SAM
                    (a bit louder)
               Er, excuse me!
    
    Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As
    he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
    down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as
    it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He
    continues over to the TECHNICIAN.
    
                              SAM
                    (louder)
               Excuse me.
    
    He touches the TECHNICIAN on the shoulder, who jumps with
    a start. He spins around and turns out to be none other
    than JACK LINT. He is amazed to see SAM.
    
                              SAM
                    (surprised)
               Jack!!
    
                             JACK
                    (recovering slightly)
               SAM! What a surprise!
    
                              SAM
                    (even more surprised)
               Are you officer 412/L?
    
    JACK looks confused. He pauses, and then removes ear
    plugs.
    
                             JACK
                    (shaking Sam's hand)
               Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told
               me you were coming aboard -
               congratulations!
    
                              SAM
               Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
    
                             JACK
               For my sins. Are you settling in
               alright?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, thanks.
    
                             JACK
               Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped
               by. Unfortunately, I don't have any
               time right now I've got a queue of
               customers to deal with - er, why
               don't we have a drink tonight?
    
                              SAM
                     (diffidently)
               Ah ...
    
                             JACK
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I don't want to take up your time
               now, but I was hoping you could give
               me some information on somebody. It's
               a security level three matter and
               Information Retrieval records says to
               refer to you.
    
                             JACK
               OK. Come back this afternoon, about
               four o'clock. If you give me the
               number of the case, I'll have the
               dossier here waiting.
                    (he pulls card from his
                    pocket - pushes it towards
                    Sam)
               My tailor,... well worth the
               investment.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out sheets
                    from his pocket)
               I've got numbers all over these - I'm
               not sure which is the one you want.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking at the print-out
                    picture of Jill over Sam's
                    shoulder)
               Layton! Oh shit!
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             JACK
               You clever bastard! I might have
               guessed. You only moved in today and
               you're already hot on the bloody
               trail.
    
                              SAM
    Am I?
    
                             JACK
    Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other
    on this one. If you make a reputation with this case,
    it'll be at my expense.
    
                              SAM
               How do you mean?
    
                             JACK
               How much do you know?
    
                              SAM
               Not much.
    
                             JACK
               Enough though, eh?
    
                              SAM
                    (getting sucked into this
                    exchange)
               Not really, no.
    
    JACK goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full
    blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin.
    
                             JACK
               OK. OK. Let's not fence around ...
               This is the situation. Some idiot
               somewhere in the building, some
               insect, confused two of our clients,
               B58/732 and T47/215.
    
                              SAM
               B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
    
                             JACK
               Christ! You do know it all!
    
                              SAM
               No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning
               Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
    
                             JACK
               Well, your A. Buttle has been
               confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.
               I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should
               be shot for that. So B58/732 was
               pulled in by mistake.
    
                              SAM
               You got the wrong man.
    
                             JACK
                    (a little heated)
               I did not get the wrong man. I got
               the right man. The wrong man was
               delivered to me as the right man! I
               accepted him, on trust, as the right
               man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to
               the confusion, he died on us. Which,
               had he been the right man, he
               wouldn't have done.
    
                              SAM
               You killed him?
    
                             JACK
                    (annoyed)
               Sam, there are very rigid parameters
               laid down to avoid that event but
               Buttle's heart condition did not
               appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think
               I'm dismissing this business, Sam.
               I've lost a week's sleep over it
               already.
                               
                              SAM
               I'm sure you have
    
                             JACK
               There are some real bastards in this
               department who don't mind breaking a
               few eggs to make an omelette, but
               thank God there are the new boys like
               me who want to maintain decent
               civilized standards of terrorist
               eradication. We've got the upper hand
               for the moment, but they're waiting
               for us to slip up, and a little slip-
               up like this is just the chance
               they're looking for.
    
                              SAM
               So how ...?
    
                             JACK
               What I've got to do now is pick up
               Tuttle, interrogate him at the same
               voltage as Buttle, to the same meter
               reading to the last penny, and juggle
               the books in electrical banking.
    
                              SAM
               What has Tuttle done?
    
                             JACK
               We suspect him of freelance
               subversion.
    
                              SAM
                    (dumbly)
               He's a freelance subversive?
    
                             JACK
               He's a compulsive heating engineer. A
               maverick ex-Central Service repair
               man with a grudge against society.
               Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of
               the wood, I think. At least we will
               be when I get this Layton woman under
               arrest.
    
    JACK turns off taps and goes behind screen.
    
                              SAM
                    (agitated)
               What's she done?
    
                             JACK
               You didn't know as much about this
               business as you pretended to, did
               you?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... no.
    
                             JACK
               Very smart.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... but I would've found out
               anyway.
    
                             JACK
               Yes. I'm impressed.
    
                              SAM
                    (playing the game)
               Tell me about Layton.
    
                             JACK
               She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the
               Buttle arrest - and since then she's
               been making wild allegations,
               obviously trying to exploit the
               situation - she's working for
               somebody, and she's not working for
               us.
    
                              SAM
               A terrorist?
    
    JACK comes from behind the screen with a look confirming
    just what SAM fears, and hands him a suit.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... thanks.
    
    SAM begins to put the suit on.
    
                              SAM
                    (hesitantly)
               But surely, I mean, perhaps she just
               happened to live above the Buttles,
               and ...
    
                             JACK
                    (picking up photograph of
                    wife and kids from his
                    desk)
               Look after that suit, eh. Barbara
               chose it for me.
    
                              SAM
               Right. Er, you're not going to keep
               calling her Barbara, are you?
    
                             JACK
               Barbara's a perfectly good name,
               isn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (preferring to let his
                    drop)
               Look, about the Layton woman - maybe
               she's just trying to help the Buttle
               family.
    
                             JACK
               Why?
    
                              SAM
               Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
    
                             JACK
                    {baffled)
               I don't follow you.
    
                              SAM
               Out of kindness.
    
                             JACK
                    (utterly baffled)
               Kindness? What's the purpose behind
               this line of enquiry?
    
                              SAM
                    (deciding to abandon this
                    line of country)
               So what are you going to do about
               her?
    
                             JACK
               Get her out of circulation - I've put
               her on the detention list.
    
                              SAM
                    (thinking fast)
               You mean you're going to invite her
               in so that she can spill the beans
               inside the department?
    
                             JACK
                    (taken aback)
               Well, I ... Good point. What do you
               suggest?
    
                              SAM
               Let me try to get to her. I'll
               deactivate her.
    
                             JACK
               What does that mean? I don't want to
               be involved in anything unsavoury.
    
                              SAM
               Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
    
                             JACK
               Of course. We went to school
               together. You're my oldest friend.
    
                              SAM
               And you're mine.
    
                             JACK
               You're the only person I can trust.
    
                              SAM
               Then we'd better keep this business
               just between the two of us.
    
                             JACK
               Right! Just between as and the
               Security Forces.
    
                              SAM
               They weren't at school with us.
    
                             JACK
               But, I've already put her on the
               search and detain list.
    
                              SAM
               Take her off the list.
    
                             JACK
               There's no procedure for that until
               she's been arrested.
    
                              SAM
               Say it was a mistake.
    
                             JACK
               We don't make mistakes.
    
                              SAM
               Well, I'd better get out there and
               try to get to her before security
               does. Let me borrow her dossier for a
               while.
    
                             JACK
               Er ... alright. For Christ's sake
               don't lose it. Here, you'd better
               sign for it.
    
    JACK presents SAM with something to sign. He then gives
    him the dossier.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
    
                             JACK
               Do you know what you're doing.
    
                              SAM
                    (about to say no, then
                    pauses)
               Trust me.
    
                             JACK
                    (admiring Sam's new look)
               Sam ... we're proud to have you at
               Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas.
                    (he hands Sam another
                    executive package)
    
    
73  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            73
    
    SAM steps out of Room 5001, newly suited with old suit
    over arm. TWO GUARDS are guiding a BAGGEE down the
    corridor ahead of him. Suddenly, the BAGGEE breaks away
    from his GUARDS and begins to cannonball down the corridor
    directly at SAM. SAM is flattened against the wall as the
    BAGGEE rockets by.
    
    CUT to GUARDS strolling past SAM.
    CUT to BAGGEE running full tilt to the end of the
    corridor, smashing into the wall, bouncing back, getting
    up (now cross-ways in the corridor), bouncing off that
    wall, then the wall behind him, then ...
    
    
74  INT.   LIFT                              DAY            74
    
    Slightly unnerved, SAM gets in the lift, pushes the button
    for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing
    JILL's dossier. The lift descends. But unnoticed by SAM
    continued past his floor without stopping. It stops at the
    Lobby Mezzanine. SAM looks up and realizes he is on the
    wrong floor. Angrily he pushes the correct floor number
    but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice
    echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the
    direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing
    with the PORTER.
    
                             JILL
               But you've stamped this form before!
               Why won't you stamp it now?
    
                            PORTER
               You've just said yourself, Miss,
               we've already stamped it. Why should
               we stamp it twice?
    
    SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift
    doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes
    the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this
    point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross
    between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille
    doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall
    in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of
    dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the
    Ministry.)
    
    SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see
    SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of
    the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.
    SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
    to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL
    disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.
    
    
75  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            75
    
    The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to
    respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are
    waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them
    hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the
    buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of
    the lift and is able to read the sign - "LIFT OUT OF
    ORDER". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All
    the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off
    to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it
    he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but
    there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before
    he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.
    
                             VOICE
               Hey, you - get out of there.
    
    A GUARD approaches looking tough and mean.
    
                             GUARD
               What do you think you're doing ...
               that's the Deputy Minister's lift.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
    
                             GUARD
               Hold on, sonny ... let's see your
               I.D.
    
    SAM fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to
    the lobby before JILL leaves. He has forgotten he is
    wearing his new I.D. badge. The GUARD can't see it because
    JILL's dossier is covering it.
    
                              SAM
               Shit ... it's here somewhere. My
               name's Lowry, Sam Lowry - Expediting
               ... can't this wait?
    
                             GUARD
               No, sir ...
                    (getting out book of forms)
               I'm going to have to file a report on
               this. Now ... what date is it
               today?...
    
    SAM gives up trying to find his I.D. card.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               Sorry, it'll have to wait.
    
    He runs off - dropping suit - towards some stairs he has
    spotted.
    
                             GUARD
               Stop!! Come back!
    
    He starts to run after SAM. TWO OTHER GUARDS also give
    chase.
    
    
75a INT.   STAIRS                            DAY           75a
    
    SAM scrambles up the stairs. GUARDS in pursuit.
    
    
76  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            76
    
    The original GUARD rushes over to a guard desk and inserts
    key into cover of what is clearly an alarm button.
    
    
77  INT.   STAIRS                            DAY             77
    
    SAM still running.
    
    
78  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY             78
    
    JILL is still arguing with PORTER.
    
                             JILL
                    (sweetly)
               You're a stupid, fat arsed,
               obstructive, fascist moron aren't
               you?
    
                            PORTER
               If you say so.
    
                             JILL
               You think these are tits don't you?
    
                            PORTER
               Ah.
    
                             JILL
               I bet you'd like to touch them?
    
                            PORTER
               Oh.
    
                             JILL
               Well don't. You're looking at twenty
               pounds of high explosive! And if you
               don't stamp this form I'm going to
               blow the place up!
    
    JILL thumps the desk with her fist.
    
    
79  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY             79
    
    The GUARD throws the alarm switch.
    
    
80  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY            80
    
    Alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily
    armed GUARDS leap out, their guns trained on JILL as she
    appears to be the only person around.
    
                             GUARD
                    (shouting)
               DROP IT!!
    
    JILL has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully
    drops. She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the
    response to her hitting the desk. The GUARDS close in.
    
    SAM rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. He can't
    believe the sight that greets him. He responds
    instinctively,
    
                              SAM
               STOP! Let her go!
    
    He rushes over to the Porter's desk just as the GUARDS
    behind him come through the door. He doesn't have a clue
    what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of
    GUARDS they snap attention. Confused he looks around and
    then realizes his I.D. badge, is on his lapel and the
    GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him
    screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to
    attention. Everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant
    to make the next move. SAM breaks the silence.
    
                              SAM
               Well done ... uh ... excellent work
               ... quick thinking. I'll take charge
               of her now ...
    
    Realising he has JILL's dossier, he shows it to everyone -
    her print-out pictures are on the front page.
    It's a classified matter ... I'll include your fine
    handling of the situation in my report
    
    SAM is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive
    toy present - he hands it to the PORTER.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Jill)
               Come with me, please.
    
    He hustles her towards the door.
    
    
81  EXT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BUILDING    DAY             81
    
    SAM marches JILL out of the main door and down the front
    steps of the Information Retrieval building. As he
    struggles with her some of the papers in the dossier slip
    out unbeknownst to SAM and leave a trail of litter behind
    them.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you? Let go!
    
                              SAM
               Don't look back! Act naturally!
    
                             JILL
               How can I act naturally, when you've
               trying to break my arm?
    
    CUT to the POV of the Ministry of Information front door
    GUARDS. They are looking down the steps at the retreating
    backs of SAM and JILL who are jostling each other. The
    GUARDS see JILL elbow SAM in the ribs.
    
                              SAM
                    (wincing)
               Ow! That hurt!
    
                             JILL
               Good!
    
                       VOICE FROM BEHIND
               STOP! Come back here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh, God ... no!
    
    He turns around, knowing that the game is up. But instead
    of one of the GUARDS shouting - it's an OLD LADY angrily
    glaring at him and pointing to a "Keep your city tidy"
    sign above a litter bin.
    
                           OLD LADY
                    (screaming)
               Can't you read english? You
               illiterate foreign pig! You come here
               from your own filthy country and
               think you can mess our streets up!
               You should be fried alive, you dirty
               verminous ... etc. etc.
    
    SAM sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the
    pavement. He lets go of JILL for a moment to grab at the
    papers. The LADY continues screaming at him, her little
    Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his
    bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping SAM's new trousers.
    SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the
    dossier and following JILL who has disappeared round the
    corner. He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after
    JILL.
    
    CUTTING back to the TWO GUARDS, who have been observing
    all this bizarre activity, we see one of them reading one
    of the pieces of paper.
    
                          OTHER GUARD
               Hey, you shouldn't be reading that
               it's classified.
    
    
82  EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            DAY             82
    
    JILL is behind the steering wheel of her lorry which is
    just starting to move off. SAM frantically runs towards
    the lorry, leaps on the running board and pulls himself up
    into the cab.
    
    
83  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY            83
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing in)
               Well done, that's it ... Let's go!
               Vrmmm. Vrmmm.
    
    SAM looks up and down his side of the street anxiously
    before realizing that JILL has switched off the engine and
    is sitting glaring at him. They are stopped, right in
    front of the Ministry building.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               What are you doing? For Christ's
               sake! Get moving!
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
    Desperately SAM pulls roller blind down over window.
    
                              SAM
                    (hurriedly)
               Sam Lowry. Hello. This sounds insane,
               I know, but I've been dreaming about
               you. Even before I saw you you were
               in my dreams. Weird isn't it. I mean
               ... I don't know what it means ...
               but it might mean something ...
               mightn't it? I hope so. Anyway you're
               in danger and I think we should get
               out of here, now, quick! Come on!
    
    Still JILL does nothing. SAM pulls down roller blind over.
    window.
    
                              SAM
                    (desperate)
               Bloody hell! Do as I say!
    
                             JILL
                    (hard, icy cool)
               No.
    
                              SAM
                    (beginning to lose his
                    bottle)
               Please!
    
    JILL continues to sit, glaring.
    
    SAM delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of
    I.D. cards and papers, most of which fall onto the floor.
    He then remembers that the badge he's looking for is
    pinned to his jacket. He thrusts it forward at JILL.
    
                              SAM
                    (beside himself with panic)
               Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm
               Information Retrieval Officer -
                    (he checks the number
                    somewhere. On the badge?)
               DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for -
               your own good! Now start up and get
               moving before I hand you back to
               them!
                    (indicating M.I. building)
    
                             JILL
               Them?
    
                              SAM
               Us. Them. I don't know ... just get
               going.
    
    JILL starts up and moves off, very cool, in her own time.
    By now SAM has got the shakes.
    
                             JILL
                    (indicting the papers that
                    Sam has dropped)
               Don't litter my cab!
    
                              SAM
                    (picking them up)
               Oh, sorry.
    
    
84  EXT.   CITY FREEWAY                      DAY            84
    
    A high shot of the lorry, moving through the city among
    traffic.
    
    
85  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  DAY            85
    
    JILL is preoccupied with driving. She is smoking a
    cigarette. SAM occasionally glances at her.
    
                              SAM
               ... This is amazing ... for me ...
               being here with you. I mean, in my
               dreams you ...
    
                             JILL
               I don't want to hear about your
               fucking dreams!
    
                              SAM
               Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted
               at you.
    
                             JILL
                    (mainly to herself)
               Why are they all pigs at Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               I don't know.
                    (realizing that this
                    includes him)
               Hey, that's not a very nice thing to
               say.
    
    JILL blows smoke in SAM's direction.
    
                              SAM
                    (waving the smoke away)
               You know, smoking's bad for you.
    
                             JILL
               It's my fucking life.
    
                              SAM
                    (winding down the window)
               Yes, of course. Sorry.
    
                             JILL
                    (lighting up another
                    cigarette)
               I know you. I saw you through the
               floor, didn't I?
    
                              SAM
               Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't run away. I left the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Why?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't like it.
    
                              SAM
               Why not?
    
                             JILL
               It had a hole in the floor. Where are
               we going?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're
               taking me.
    
                             JILL
               It does doesn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly worried)
               Where are you taking me?
    
    
86  EXT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  86
    
    We PULL BACK and lift off to see that the beautiful
    countryside through which we've been travelling is in fact
    a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts
    of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray
    flavored cigarettes - you name it - These advertisements
    form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels.
    From a bird's eye POV we see that the land behind the
    hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc.
    
    
87  EXT.   POWER PLANT            DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)      87
    
    The power plant is an extensive, brutal, Dante's Inferno
    of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys,
    huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... It
    is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and
    forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. In the
    murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective
    clothing and hard hats.
    
    This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ...
    The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
    JILL jumps down from the cab. SAM stays inside, looking
    around. Something catches his eye.
    
    CUT to facade of house. Window boxes with flowers and
    shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide
    domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with
    protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his
    face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out
    of frame.
    
    In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and
    a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled
    with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto
    the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
    of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
    the power plant.
    
    
88  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY             88
    
    SAM watches JILL walk away from the lorry and enter the
    despatcher's hut. He looks around uneasily and then he
    start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
    compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He
    gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the
    seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had
    carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this
    cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the
    cab door.
    
                             JILL
               Don't act guilty. Act like me. I'm
               just getting on with my job. Or, are
               you just getting on with yours?
    
    JILL gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a
    forward looking position.
    
                              SAM
               What's going on here?
    
                             JILL
               What does it look like ... I'm
               collecting empties.
               
    The lorry stops and JILL gets out. From SAM'S P.O.V., the
    house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
    sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a
    package out from behind the seat. She glances
    surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel
    inside her jacket she walks away.
    
    
89  EXT.   LORRY                             LATE AFTERNOON 89
    
    SAM climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on
    JILL. He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot
    standard. The picture on it - though faded by pollution -
    is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by
    the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her
    way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the
    corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be
    exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious
    behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on
    the side of the building that illustrates, almost
    identically, the action we have just seen along with the
    warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL. EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE".
    
    CUT to the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry.
    
    
90  INT.   LORRY CAB                         LATE AFTERNOON 90
    
    JILL is starting up the lorry. SAM is glancing over her
    shoulder at the suspicious parcel which is tucked behind
    her. They move off. The last view of the power plant is of
    a group of MEN all in protective clothing and masks
    happily playing a game of volleyball.
    
    
91  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  LATER AFTERNOON91
    
                              SAM
               OK. What's in the parcel?
    
                             JILL
               What parcel?
    
    SAM nods knowingly in the direction of the parcel.
    JILL I don't know. Christmas present.
    SAM picks it up.
    
                              SAM
               It's heavy.
    
                             JILL
               A heavy Christmas present.
    
    He glances at her suspiciously.
    
                             JILL
               Open it if you don't trust me.
    
    SAM hesitates and puts the parcel down.
    
                              SAM
               I'd rather trust you.
    
    
    JILL gives him a quizzical look and smiles slightly, in
    spite of herself. She turns away so that he won't notice.
    
    
92  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY IN CITY TRAFFIC  DUSK           92
    
                             JILL
               What are you doing in Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               Looking for you.
    
                             JILL
               No, really.
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                             JILL
               I mean, it doesn't suit you.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at his jacket)
               Suit me?
    
                             JILL
               Don't you know the sort of thing that
               Information Retrieval does?
    
                              SAM
               What do you mean? Would you rather
               have terrorists?
    
                             JILL
               We've got both.
    
                              SAM
               Things would be worse without
               Information Retrieval.
    
                             JILL
               They couldn't be worse for the
               Buttles.
    
    SAM is at a loss.
    
                             JILL
               Why don't you say, no system is
               perfect.
    
                              SAM
               Well, no system is.
    
                             JILL
               Say, all wars have innocent victims.
    
                              SAM
               Well, all wars do -
    
                             JILL
               Who is this war against, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Well, terrorists of course.
    
                             JILL
               How many terrorists have you met?
               Actual terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's
               only my first day.
    
    JILL bursts out laughing. SAM joins in. They are both
    laughing hysterically as they approach the Central
    Supplies depot.
    
    
93  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK            93
    
    The impression is that the place could be an abandoned
    airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose
    contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all
    the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles
    of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily
    grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated
    houses) standing in the open others protected under simple
    areas of roofing. Each group of Assorted Supplies lies
    inside the squares of the grid of streets. The streets are
    eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each
    square is also lit by harsh localized lighting. The effect
    is a nightmarish gigantic Aladdin's cave of black shadows
    and garishly lit mountains of stuff.
    
    
94  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           94
    
    JILL's lorry starts down one of the "streets".
    
                             JILL
                    (as they pass a clock in
                    "C"s)
               Look at that - right on time.
    
                              SAM
               What? I thought you were free to come
               and go as you please.
    
                             JILL
               Well, almost ... unfortunately I do
               have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly surprised)
               Every day?
    
                              SAM
               Turn around!
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               They'll be there waiting.
    
                             JILL
               Who will?
    
                              SAM
               Security.
    
                             JILL
               You're joking.
    
                              SAM
               No. Please. They're going to arrest
               you.
    
                             JILL
               I thought you arrested me.
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
                    (he grabs for the emergency
                    brake)
    
                             JILL
                    (pushing his hand away)
               Cut it out, Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing at the steering
                    wheel)
               Will you please turn back.
    
                             JILL
                    (shoving him back)
               Get away!
    
                              SAM
                    (lunging for the steering
                    wheel)
               Turn!
    
                             JILL
                    (unable to control him)
               Stop it ... damn you!
    
    SAM throws the lorry into a gut-sucking skid.
    
    
95  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           95
    
    The lorry skids around a corner and roars down a side
    street of containers.
    
    
96  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK            96
    
    SAM and JILL are fighting for control of the lorry.
    
                             JILL
               You're mad! You're out of your mind!
    
    At that moment the air is split apart by the wail of
    sirens. SAM and JILL look back.
    
    
97  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           97
    
    From inside two strategically placed wooden containers
    stacked amongst the piles of containers marked
    "AUTOMOBILES" burst forth two Security vehicles. Wood
    flying, lights flashing, wheels smoking - they squeal away
    in pursuit.
    
    
98  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           98
    
                              SAM
               I was right! Step on it!
    
                             JILL
               Let go! We've got to stop!
    
                              SAM
               Now you're the one that's out of your
               mind.
    
                             JILL
               Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll
               kill us!
    
    They struggle for control of the lorry.
    
    
99  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           99
    
    The lorry rumbles down the street of containers lurching
    from side to side as the battle in the cab wages back and
    forth. Containers are smashed open and their contents
    spill out only to be further damaged as the pursuing
    Security vehicles crash through them. The lorry escapes
    from the streets of containers and cannons through the
    main gate and out on to the streets of the city.
    
    
100 INT.   LORRY CAB                         DUSK          100
    
    SAM and JILL are still struggling violently for control of
    the lorry. SAM is terribly inexpert as a driver but he
    behaves like someone possessed. Through the rear view
    mirrors he can see the Security vehicles catching up with
    them. He starts fumbling with he multiple gear levers.
    
                             JILL
               Don't touch those!
    
    
101 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREETS                  DUSK           101
    
    The lorry roars down a street of terraced houses and then
    screeches around a corner.
    
    
102 INT.   LORRY                             DUSK          102
    
    SAM pushes JILL's hand back and grabs for the lever that
    he thinks is overdrive. But rather than gaining speed
    there is a terrible lurch as the house and trailer
    disconnect from the cab.
    
    
103 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          103
    
    The house slides off the trailer which is skidding
    sideways and crunches to the ground just as the Security
    vehicles round the corner.
    
    
104 INT.   SECURITY VEHICLE                  DUSK          104
    
    From behind the DRIVER we can see that the house has
    settled across the roadway at right-angle to the other
    houses, making it appear to be a normal dead end street.
    So shocked is the DRIVER that he fails to stop in time and
    KABLOW!! the car smashes into the house.
    
    
105 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          105
    
    Hot on the heels of the 1st car, the 2nd vehicle skids and
    then smashes into the house which collapses and then
    explodes in flames.
    
    
106 INT.   JILL'S LORRY                      DUSK          106
    
    SAM sits paralysed with shock. The lorry has come to a
    halt. JILL is desperately trying to get him to move.
    
                             JILL
               Come on, let's go! Let's get out of
               here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh God! What have we done?
    
                             JILL
               We? Don't blame me!
    
                              SAM
               It wasn't supposed to happen like
               this.
    
                             JILL
                    (looking behind)
               Shit! The house is on fire!
    
                              SAM
               "And your children all gone."
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home,
               your house is on fire and your
               children all gone" ... Do you think
               anyone's hurt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
                    (tapping him on the
                    forehead)
               Come out, I know you're in there
    
    
107 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          107
    
    A Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the
    streets. We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and
    skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from
    JILL's lorry. Heavily armed SECURITY POLICE pour out and
    take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever
    other cover is available. Searchlights are played on the
    lorry. The OFFICER IN CHARGE appears with a loud-hailer.
    
                       OFFICER IN CHARGE
               Come out, we know you're in there!
               You cannot possibly escape. Throw
               your weapons from your vehicle and
               come out slowly with your hands on
               your heads. Obey my instructions and
               no harm will come to you. But if you
               force us to shoot we'll shoot to
               kill.
    
    During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle "roars"
    around a corner behind the SECURITY POLICE. He rides into
    a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes
    cover" behind it. He points his toy rifle at JILL's lorry
    and takes shot. In reaction to the noise made by the kid's
    rifle the OFFICER IN CHARGE dives for cover and the
    SECURITY TROOPS open fire and pepper JILL's lorry cab with
    holes. A few of the SECURITY TROOPS then rush forward and
    fling open the cab door. The cab is empty. The OFFICER IN
    CHARGE gets to his feet and looks about. His uniform is
    covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. He just
    misses seeing the back of the BOY as he disappears round
    the corner on his tricycle.
    
    
108 INT.   LINGERIE DEPARTMENT/SHOPPING CENTRE              108
    
    To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
    sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. As we
    slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of
    exotic occasions we come upon SAM and JILL pushing a
    shopping trolley. In the trolley is the "suspicious"
    parcel which JILL was given at the power plant.
    
                              SAM
               This is a hell of a time to buy a
               nightie.
    
                             JILL
               Are you still following me?
    
                              SAM
               Please, Jill ... I love you.
    
                             JILL
               Go away.
    
                              SAM
               There are plenty of other safe
               places. Why don't we go back to my
               flat?
    
                             JILL
               Leave me alone!
    
                              SAM
               You've got to trust me. It sounds
               silly but I know we were meant to
               meet.
    
                             JILL
               You mean you were meant to hijack my
               truck, make me crash it, and have
               every security man in town looking
               for me?
    
                              SAM
               I vas just trying to help. I decided
               to trust you. Maybe I was wrong.
               Whose side are you on really? Who are
               your friends? Who was the man who
               gave you the parcel? What's in it?
               It's the only thing you saved from
               the lorry .... It must he something
               very special.
    
                             JILL
               I saved you from the lorry and you're
               not very special.
    
                              SAM
               ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated)
               Oh ... Jesus!
    
    SAM grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start
    tearing it open.
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to open it!
    
                             JILL
                    (grabbing parcel and trying
                    to take it from him)
               No you're not!
    
    They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. SAM's
    suit gets slightly ripped. Their tug-of-war is interrupted
    by a voice off camera.
    
                             VOICE
               SAM!!
    
    SAM turns to see MRS TERRAIN and SHIRLEY a short distance
    away. MRS TERRAIN is heavily bandaged and sitting in a
    wheelchair which SHIRLEY is pushing.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               It's me and Shirley!
    
    From the TERRAINS' POV SAM looks as if he is wrestling
    with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full
    length mirror. The mirror or something obscures JILL. MRS
    TERRAIN and SHIRLEY exchange puzzled looks and proceed
    toward SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets
               go of the parcel and pushes JILL
               away. She moves off.
    
                              SAM
                    (after Jill for Mrs
                    Terrain's benefit)
               I think that'll hold it.
                    (to Shirley)
               Hello Shirley. Just helping someone
               tie up a Christmas present. How are
               you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               My complication had a complication,
               but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up
               and bouncing about like a young
               gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas
               present for your mother?
    
                              SAM
                    (Trying to keep an eye on
                    Jill who is disappearing
                    from sight)
               Er, yes ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Shirley and I come here regularly. I
               love romantic lingerie.
    
    She unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things
    with strategic holes in them.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (coyly)
               Picture me in these.
    
    At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
    corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw
    JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust
    covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop
    dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over
    the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees
    JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
    plaster dust. He rushes over to her.
    
                              SAM
                           (frantic)
               Are you alright?
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
                    (anxiety giving way to
                    anger)
               You don't deserve to be! You should
               be dead, or maimed like them .... How
               could you ...?
                    (indicating the wounded)
               What a bloody stupid thing ... I
               should. have made you open it in the
               lorry
    
    She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
    open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.
    Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.
    She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's
    chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with
    the severed limbs of a shop dummy.
    
                             JILL
               There's your bomb! Our annual bribes
               for official ass-holes like you!
    
    SAM sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. Liquor
    oozes from the broken bottle all over SAM's suit. He is at
    a loss for words.
    
    JILL's attention is attracted by moans coming from the
    badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS. She goes to help them.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Sam)
               Come on, make yourself useful, there
               are people hurt!
               
    JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable.
    SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his
    Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
    make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are
    wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is
    general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and
    begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED.
    ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is
    attending.
    
                             JILL
               Hey stop ... she's hurt!
    
    The GUARD gives JILL a thump in the side of the face with
    his gloved hand. SAM sees red.
    
                              SAM
               DON'T TOUCH HER!!
    
    The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed
    into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over
    the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted
    lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up
    with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It
    makes a passable club.
    
                             JILL
               SAM .... don't!!
    
    The TWO COMBATANTS square off ... looking for an opening
    ... a chink in the other's defences - at which point SAM
    is flattened from behind by a TROOPER's gun butt.
    
    
108a       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY108a
    
    SAM is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. He
    tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing
    descent. With a thud he hits the bottom. Stunned, bruised
    and battered he tries to get up. Standing over him are the
    GREY PRISONERS. They press forward.
    
                              SAM
                    (feebly)
               Where is she? Is she here?
    
    The GREY PRISONERS dissolve into what looks like several
    BAGGEES.
    
    
109 INT.   BLACK MARIA                       EVENING       109
    
    The BAGGEES hang from a track on the ceiling of the Black
    Maria. SAM is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket,
    with his badge prominently displayed. He is dazed and
    mumbling ... the only BAGGEE in the wagon apart from TWO
    GUARDS who have removed their helmets and are relaxing
    while travelling back to base.
    
                            GUARD A
                    (scratching his head)
               These helmets don't half make your
               scalp itch.
    
                            GUARD B
               Ooh, don't mention it.
                    (beginning to scratch his
                    head)
               And they make you sweat. Half the
               time I can't see where I'm going -
               there's a great Niagara of
               perspiration coming down.
    
                            GUARD A
               I'm lucky, I've got thick eyebrows.
               That keeps it up and channels it out
               to my ears.
    
    SAM stirs and groans
    
                            GUARD B
               Who's he?
    
                            GUARD A
               Someone from Information Retrieval
               they're always hanging about in
               lingerie.
    
    SAM is coming to his senses. He takes in the situation,
    sees all the BAGGEES and staggers to his knees.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill! Are you there?!
    
    He begins rummaging through the BAGGEES. ONE of which is
    dressed as FATHER CHRISTMAS. SAM opens the "face vent" of
    the BAGGEE'S' hoods. A pair of strange eyes look out.
    
                            GUARD A
               Excuse me, sir - that's government
               property.
    
                              SAM
               Is here a girl here? Tall, fair hair,
               blue eyes?
    
                            GUARD A
               Dunno sir. They check all that at the
               depot.
    
    SAM continues fumbling about the BAGGEES.
    
                            GUARD 3
                      (pulling Sam back)
               We can't allow you to do that sir,
               it's more than our job's worth.
    
                              SAM
                    (shaking Guard off)
               I've got to find her! Jill! Jill!
    
                            GUARD A
               You can always fill in an application
               form, if you're a relative, sir.
               Please stop, sir.
    
    SAM takes no notice.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill!
    
    GUARD A hits SAM, knocking him out again.
    
                            GUARD A
               Sorry about that sir. Regulations.
               We'll have you safely back in your
               office in no time.

112 INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      EVENING       112
    
    SAM recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his
    desk in his office. He is bruised and battered and has a
    black eye. His suit is torn and bloody. MR WARREN is
    gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture.
    Behind WARREN, crowding the doorway, are the PEOPLE who
    circulate around him and are the cast of the WARREN high
    energy circus. LIME is with them.
    
                            WARREN
               This is a black eye for the
               department, Lowry! ... And I don't
               care how you behaved when you were at
               Records! Information Retrieval is an
               executive branch! We're proud of our
               reputation and we protect it!
    
    One of his ACCOLYTES thrusts a paper into his hand - he
    glances at it.
    
               Damn it, Lowry, that convoy of troop
               carriers is still not accounted for
               ... I thought I told you to deal with
               it.
    
    He slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with
    other forms.
    
               And what the hell is this mess? An
               empty desk is an efficient desk.
    
    He has picked up some of the forms.
    
               Good God! ... queries from Security,
               searches from Central Banking about a
               cheque, clarification notices from
               Accounting concerning unreturned
               receipts, another demand from the
               Motor Pool.
    
                              SAM
               Mr Warren ... I have to find out
               about ...
                               
                            WARREN
               Shut up! I don't know what's going on
               here, Lowry, but don't think you can
               intimidate us with your friends and
               relatives in high places! Now shape
               up!
    
    He dumps the papers and folders onto SAM's desk and storms
    off with his ENTOURAGE, leaving a gleeful LIME in the
    doorway.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Lime as he starts
                    to slip away)
               Lime, I need to use your computer
    
                             LIME
               Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.
                    (he indicates Sam's
                    smothered desk)
               You seem to have quite a lot to do
               yourself.
                    (he disappears into his
                    office)

    SAM rushes out of his office after LIME. But, LIME has
    locked his door. SAM bangs on the door.
    
                              SAM
               Shit!
    
    
112b       INT.                              SAM'S OFFICE   DAY112b
    
    SAM storms back into his office. Reaching a peak of
    frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the
    pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. Within
    seconds it returns. SAM sends it off a second time. It
    doesn't return a second time, periodically something
    passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's
    pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up.
    At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep
    through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it.
    There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM
    smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and
    then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM's
    office door. It shakes the whole building. SAM goes to his
    door and opens it.
    
    
113 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    CONTINUATION  113
    
    Every door in the corridor has been opened by the
    occupants of the room. All the occupants stick their heads
    into the corridor, all gazing with SAM at the variously
    coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the
    whole length of the corridor ceiling, from which protrudes
    the intestines of the pneumatic system.
    
    
114 INT.   JACK'S OFFICE CORRIDOR & INFORMATION         EVENING114
           RETRIEVAL CORRIDORS
    
    It is the end of the working day. JACK is leaving for
    home. He is putting on his executive-styled bullet-proof
    vest and packing his "Secret Connection" briefcase. As the
    scene progresses SAM and JACK proceed out of the door and
    down he corridor, passing other I.R. OFFICIALS. SAM is
    dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to
    JACK to is trying to distance himself from him.
    
                              SAM
               Come off it, Jack! Of course you can
               check to see if she's been arrested.
    
                             JACK
               I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole
               case has become much more complicated
               since last we talked.
    
                              SAM
                    (exasperated)
               She's innocent, Jack --- she's done
               nothing wrong.
    
                             JACK
               Tell that to the wives of the
               Security men she blew up this
               afternoon. Listen, we've also had a
               report just in from Central Services
               that Tuttle has wrecked an entire
               flat and sabotaged adjacent Central
               Services systems - as a matter of
               fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes
               open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
    
                              SAM
                    (catching up with Jack)
               You don't really think Tuttle and the
               girl are in league?
    
                             JACK
               I do. Goodbye.
                    (steps into lift)
    
    
115 INT.   LIFT                              EVENING       115
    
                              SAM
               It could all be coincidental.
    
                             JACK
               There are no coincidences, Sam.
               Everything's connected, all along the
               line. Cause and effect. That's the
               beauty of it. Our job is to trace the
               connections and reveal them.
                    (whispers)
               This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion
               was obviously planned from the
               inside. Bye bye.
    
    
116 INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         EVENING        116
    
    JACK and SAM have just emerged from the lift. The lift
    doors close. SAM agitatedly speaks.
    
                              SAM
               Jack, she's innocent!
    
                             JACK
               Sam - we've always been close,
               haven't we?
    
                              SAM
                    (eagerly)
               Yes we have, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               Well, could you stay away from me
               until this thing blows over.
    
    
117 EXT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       NIGHT    117
                       BUILDING
    
    SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The
    lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street
    lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious
    about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to
    retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry
    front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck
    was parked.
    
    
117a       EXT.                              JUST AROUND THE
CORNER     NIGHT                             117a
    
    SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first
    parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is
    a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and
    beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the
    pavement unsure his next move. The street light is
    reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the
    reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue
    cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street
    light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru
    the inner wall of the great stone ship.
    
    
117b       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY117b
    
                    DREAM GIRL'S VOICE
               I'm here Sam. Don't give up.
    
    SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the
    crack shafts across the space in which they find
    themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There
    in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful,
    shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone
    cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards
    them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a
    great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a
    black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round
    he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the
    floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI
    WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.
    The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he
    raises his spear in front of himself in an almost
    religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.
    Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round
    just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic
    WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM
    parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then
    strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has
    vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears
    something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who
    is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.
    Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.
    He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the
    ground.
    
    Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes
    at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM
    spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM
    rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next
    to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again
    and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he
    can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with
    his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him
    to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the
    big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground
    before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the
    wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the
    situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.
    The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages
    to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and
    opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries
    to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds
    in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes
    from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The
    wounds continue to bleed fire.
    
    SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen
    WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire
    rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing
    that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's
    his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire
    begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.
    SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell
    tolls.
    
    
118 EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            NIGHT         118
    
    SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is
    staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance.
    SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's
    got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway
    but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,
    is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses
    direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice
    comes from behind him.
    
                             JILL
               You're late.
    
    SAM spins around. Stepping out from the shadows is JILL -
    cigarette in her mouth.
    
                              SAM
                    (stunned)
               Jill! What are you do ... I mean ...
               how did you ... Are you alright?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
               What happened to you after ...
    
                             JILL
               Your face ... are you hurt?
    
                              SAM
               No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick
               about you ... I thought ...
    
    A patrol car approaches. Quickly SAM grabs JILL and goes
    into a kiss to explain their presence. The car hesitates
    for a moment and drives on.
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               They're gone.
    
                              SAM
                    (through kiss)
               Are you sure?
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               Yes.
    
    They resume passionate kiss. After a moment
    
                              SAM
                    (urgently)
               C'mon, we've got to get you off the
               streets.
    
    They head off clutching one another.
    
    
119 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT          119
    
    The Elysian Fields train arrives clattering. SAM and JILL
    are the only passengers to emerge. They can't keep their
    hands off one another. This is young love at its freshest
    and most exciting. SAM looks up and down the platform
    cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train
    clatters off again into the darkness. SAM and JILL
    approach SAM's front door. He puts a key in the door and
    tries to open the door but has some difficulty. Something
    creaks. He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens
    and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head..
    
    
120 INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT         120
    
    SAM enters, followed by JILL. His breath immediately
    starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam. The
    flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then
    deep frozen. Icicles are hanging down from everywhere. The
    flat looks like a scrap dump. Every wall has spilled out
    its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of
    the available space and making progress through the flat
    difficult. Half a dozen MEN are at work. They are
    impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing
    and look more like spacemen. Their voices however belong
    to SPOOR and DOWSER.
    
                              SAM
               For God's sake, what's happened?
    
                             SPOOR
               Thermostat's gone. And then some.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... And then some.
    
                              SAM
               What have you done to my flat?
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here, please.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... ere please.
    
    SPOOR offers a clipboard and pencil. He bangs the
    clipboard against the furniture to knock the ice off it.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
               It's a 27B/6 of course.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...B/6 of course.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Dowser)
               Do you repeat everying?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (nods)
               ... Everything.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (indicating the mess)
               This is what you get when you have
               cowboys round yer ducts.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... yer ducts.
    
                             SPOOR
               I think you've got your T41 crystal
               inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin-
               threaded-solenoid-control. It's
               either that or a new washer.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... new washer.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign the form so we can get to it.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... get to it.
    
    SAM grabs the clipboard and smashes it over SPOOR's head.
    The board is so cold that it snaps in two. The paper on it
    also snaps in two.
    
    
121 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT         121
    
    SAM pulls JILL out into the corridor.
    
                             JILL
               Don't you like parties?
    
                              SAM
               C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
    
    As SAM and JILL begin to move down the corridor they see a
    cigarette glow brightly in a dark recess.
    
                             JILL
                    (seeing cigarette light)
               TOO LATE!
    
    They ere about to run when TUTTLE steps out of the
    shadows.
    
                            TUTTLE
               I'll fix the damage when they've
               gone. I'll be ready for you tomorrow.
    
    
122 INT.   MOTHER'S CORRIDOR                 NIGHT         122
    
    A venerable PORTER carrying a single key on a large ring
    is preceding SAM and JILL along the corridor which we have
    seen before. The PORTER's name is MATTHEWS.
    
                              SAM
               My mother said it would be all right.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               She didn't say anything about it to
               me.
    
                              SAM
               Well, she's my mother, not yours.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               I won't be held responsible.
    
                              SAM
               How long will she he away?
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (darkly)
               There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's
               clinic who never come back at all.
    
    MATTHEWS unlocks MOTHER's door.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (to Jill)
               You're not a professional, are you?
    
                             JILL
               No, amateur.
    
                              SAM
                    (firmly)
               Thank you, Matthews.
    
    With which he ushers JILL through the door and closes the
    door in MATTHEWS' face.
    
    
123 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          123
    
                              SAM
               Make yourself at home. Don't answer
               the phone or open he door to anyone.
               I won't be long.
    
                             JILL
               Where are you going?
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to pull some strings. It's
               our only hope.
    
                             JILL
               Don't do anything silly.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.
    
                             JILL
               Take care.
    
    SAM goes.
    
    
124 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOYER       NIGHT          124
    
    SAM arrives at the Ministry of Information Retrieval
    reception It's late. GROUPS OF CLEANERS are operating
    cleaning machinery. SAM approaches the DESK PORTER who is
    playing with the executive toy SAM gave him.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me
               through to Mr Helpmann's office?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to
               go through the proper channels.
    
                              SAM
               And you can't tell me what the proper
               channels are, because that's
               classified information?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm glad to see the Ministry's
               continuing its tradition of
               recruiting the brightest and best,
               sir.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you, Dawson.
    
    SAM crosses the foyer, checks to see that Dawson is no
    longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive
    toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment,
    disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched LIME who hobbles
    across the lobby without seeing SAM, who slips down the
    stairs which he knows lead to Helpmann's private lift.
    
    
125 INT.   BASEMENT                          NIGHT         125
    
    SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding
    a GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close
    harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction.
    They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.
    
                         CHOIR MASTER
                    (stopping them)
               No, no, no, Arthur, you're going flat
               on that G. It's your breathing. Take
               a breath on the end. of the previous
               line, after Noel. Right, one, two,
               three.
    
    The CHOIR begins singing again. SAM reaches the lift and
    looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall.
    CLOSE UP of SAM's face concentrating. He hears, we hear, a
    reprise of MR HELPMANN talking to SAM in MOTHER's
    bathroom.
    
                        HELPMANN (V/O)
               Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
               but we were close friends, and I keep
               his name alive at the office every
               day. It's as though he's there
               speaking to me. "'ere I am, J.H."
    
    SAM is already typing the letters EREIAMJH into the
    keyboard. The lift judders and star s to ascend.
    
    
126 INT.   MR HELPMANN'S OFFICE              NIGHT         126
    
    SAM steps out of lift into an ante-room. No-one is there.
    Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the
    office. No reply. He slowly opens door.
    
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?
    
    The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he
    wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's
    desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
    an elaborate computer console in a side room. It
    occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large
    bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make
    sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the
    machine lights up.
    
    He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter
    machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He
    looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the
    message coming through: TOTAL - TOTAL -TOTAL - CAR 15
    REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE
    TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE.
    This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls
    silent.
    
    SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns
    to leave.
    The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and
    goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP
    shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF
    DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL
    CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for
    two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for
    a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches
    on the machine. He has he answer.
    
    
127 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          127
    
    SAM enters the flat. JILL is nowhere to be seen. The
    lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door
    beams a shaft of bright light. Music pours forth ... it is
    "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
                    (cautiously)
               Jill?
    
    Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through.
    There is JILL but, transformed. She is wearing one of
    SAM's MOTHER's wigs which billows in the air blown by a
    fan. She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed
    from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She
    looks like the DREAM GIRL. SAM stands open-mouthed. JILL
    notices him and smiles.
    
                             JILL
               What do you think? ... is it me?
    
                              SAM
                    (still stunned)
               You don't exist any more. I've killed
               you. Jill Layton is dead.
    
    He holds out a print-out. She reads it and slowly looks
    up.
    
                             JILL
               Care for a bit of necrophilia?
    
    They rush together.
    
    
128 INT.   STONE SHIP                        ANTI-DAY      128
    
    The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing
    about a beautiful blue sky. They course this way and that.
    Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a
    mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns.
    The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as
    SAM sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light.
    He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.
    far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with
    happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his
    sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
    the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been
    lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty
    swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as
    cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is
    disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
    topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes
    into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all
    directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains
    fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a
    beautiful blue sky. They look up to the sun. SAM is
    exultant.
    
    
129 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  DAWN          129
    
    Pull back from the sun through a window. The light falls
    on SAM's smiling sleeping face. Showly he wakes. He little
    by little remembers where he is and reaches over for JILL.
    She isn't there. Sam panics.
    
                             JILL
               Merry Xmas.
    
    She is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him. She
    crawls over to him - they start to embrace.
    
                              SAM
               Everything is going to be all right.
    
    But crash !!! it's a raid! Like a giant drill a whirling
    cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of
    Mother's bedroom, and we now see what made the neat hole
    in the BUTTLE ceiling ... CUTS show doors being burst open
    by SECURITY TROOPS. JILL and SAM are frozen in panic.
    SECURITY TROOPS are sliding down a fireman's pole" from
    the hole in the ceiling.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts)
               She's dead. Check the list!
    
    But it is SAM they have come for. He is being dragged out
    of the bed.
    
                            GUARDS
                    (as they struggle with him)
               You Turncoat Bastard! JUDAS!!
               TRAITOR!!
    
    A canvas bag is plunged over his head. All goes black.
    
                              SAM
                    (muffled)
               JILL!!!
    
    A shot rings out. JILL screams. It echoes through the
    blackness.
    
    
130 INT.   PROCESSING AREA                                 130
    
    In absolute inky darkness, SAM and the CAMERA move through
    space and time marked only by voices and sounds
    encountered on the way. This sound-sequence fades in and
    out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer
    than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence. We
    hear:
    
    Footsteps of SAM and GUARDS.
    
    Distant howl of pain.
    
    Muzak.
    
    Iron gate.
    
    Footsteps again.
    
    Lift doors opening and closing.
    
    Muzak.
    
    Typing pool.
    
                         FEMALE VOICE
               a wonderful gift, I changed it at the
               chemist for some antibiotics and
               bathroom scales and there's enough
               left on the voucher for a
               tonsilectomy if I want to treat
               myself ...
    
    Office door opens and closes.

               Christmas Parcel for you, sir ...
               sign here please ...
    
    What looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness
    opens. It is the eyeslit on the front of SAM's bag being
    opened by a SECURITY GUARD.
    
    The SECURITY GUARD peers in for a moment and then steps
    back to reveal two SMART OFFICIALS sitting at a desk. They
    are looking up at SAM/us.
    
                          OFFICIAL A

               sign this form.
    
    OFFICIAL B waves a sheet of paper. We hear SAM's voice.

                          OFFICIAL A
               Right. Next!
    
    The SECURITY GUARD appears briefly and zips up the hood
    again plunging us back into darkness. We get more muffled
    shouts, heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere.
    
    Another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap on SAM's hood. We
    see another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                              SAM
                    (more hysterical)
               Where's Jill? What's happened to
               Jill?

               93/HKS/608, you've got quite a list
               of misdemeanours here, haven't you?
               All this is going to take time and
               money, and I'm afraid, according to
               your bank statement and credit rating
               here, you're likely to be in deep
               financial trouble by the end of it.

               seven or eight of these charges,
               which'll bring the costs down to
               within your reach, or you can borrow

               very competitive rates. We can offer
               you something at say, eleven and a
               half per cent, over thirty years. But

               qualify for his scheme.
    
                          OFFICIAL D
               All you have to do is to agree to

               I'm not guilty! Not guilty you stupid
               bastar...
    
    THE GUARD closes the flap. Once again darkness and
    confusion. until another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap
    again to reveal another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                          OFFICIAL E
                    (examining forms)
               Now, since you've elected to plead
               not guilty on all these charges,
               you'd be well advised to take some
               sort of insurance cover. Preferably
               comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,
               something more specific - say,
               against electrical charges over
               f70.00. And for food and
               accommodation costs of say, £800.00.
               Detention can be a very expensive
               business.
    
                          OFFICIAL F
               Now, before we bore you with the
               small print perhaps you'd like to
               tell us whether you'd like to sign
               this insurance acceptance form or
               not. Think carefully before you
               decide. Thinking ahead in financial
               matters is always the wise course.
    
    The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - NEW
    OFFICIALS are revealed. This process repeats again and
    again - getting faster and faster. The OFFICIALS' faces
    seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a
    growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the
    room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the
    OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press
    forward unseen by the OFFICIALS. Soon they fill the view
    through the flap.

131 INT.   STONE SHIP                        TIMELESS      131
    
    CUT to SAM struggling with the FORCES OF DARKNESS. He is
    overwhelmed by the black hordes. They fill the screen. SAM
    disappears under their onslaught. A pause. Then SAM is
    raised, spread-eagled, above the black sea of the FORCES.
    Strong hands hold him. The maniacal laughter starts up.
    SAM is turned in its direction.
    
    CUT to a shot over the top of the mass of robed FIGURES.
    Rising from the ruins of the stone columns, the black
    cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera. We can see
    the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom
    of Knowledge in the background.
    
    SAM looks terrified. As the thing hovers above SAM in all
    its huge twisting awfulness, it slowly begine to unfold
    like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion.
    
    SAM freezes as the interior becomes invisible. There in
    the billowing blackness is the GIRL. She is beckoning.
    
                             GIRL
               Sam.
    
    But the VOICE is no longer the mysterious feminine voice
    of before - it is the voice of the maniacal laughter.
    
    SAM struggles with the restraining hands. He twists and
    turns, but to no avail. From the darkness above him
    descends the JOLLY GENT looking just like MR HELPMANN) on
    his window washer's platform. However he is now dressed as
    Father Christmas.
    
                             GENT
               Sam, what are we going to do with
               you?
    
                             GIRL
               Ha ha ha ha ha.
    
    
132 INT.   CELL                              DAY/NIGHT     132
    
    The filing cabinets of the Storeroom of Knowledge dissolve
    squares of padding that form the walls of a cell. The
    laughter echoes round the cell. SAM sees that MR HELPMANN,
    in his wheelchair is watching him. He is dressed as Father
    Christmas. They are alone in the cell. SAM scrunches up
    into the corner.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Sam, what are we going to do with
               you? Can you hear me, Sam?
    
                              SAM
                    (in a hoarse urgent
                    whisper)
               Where's Jill? What have you done to
               her? Where is she?!
    
                           HELPMANN
               Gillian Layton?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, you've got to get me out of
               here. I've got to find her.
    
                           HELPMANN
               I understand, Sam, I know exactly how
               you feel. So I brought you a bottle
               of barley water.
               
    HELPMANN holds up a bottle of barley water.
    
                              SAM
                    (desperately)
               Help me!
    
                           HELPMANN
               I assure you, Sam, I'm doing
               everything within my power. But the
               rules of the game are laid down, and
               we all have to play by them - even
               me.
    
                              SAM
               This is all a mistake! Don't you
               understand?!
    
                           HELPMANN
               Yes, well, from the Department's
               point of view you're certainly a bit
               of an own goal, but ...
    
                              SAM
               I'm not a terrorist! You must know
               that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of
               here!
    
                           HELPMANN
               Sam, if you've been going out there
               and playing a straight bat, all the
               way down the line, you've got
               absolutely nothing to worry about.
    
                              SAM
               Please, I've got to find Jill.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Sam, I think I ought to tell you ...
               I'm afraid she's upped stumps and
               retired to the pavilion.
    
                       SAM looks blank.
    
               Thrown in the towel.
    
                              SAM
                    (takes a moment to work
                    this out)
               Dead?
    
    HELPMANN nods.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it
               seems she was killed resisting
               arrest.
    
                              SAM
                    (relieved)
               No, no ... I did that...
    
    HELPMANN looks surprised. SAM shuts up.
    
                           HELPMANN
               The odd thing is it appears to have
               happened twice ... a bit of a
               disputed call, I'm afraid.
    
    SAM has gone catatonic.
    
                           HELPMANN
                    (starting to go)
               So, there you are. All I can say is,
               don't fall at the last fence. The
               finishing post's in sight. See you in
               the paddock. Good luck. Keep your eye
               on the ball. Got to go .... Can't
               keep the orphans waiting.
    
    HELPMANN goes. A GUARD helps him out and then returns with
    ANOTHER to help put the restraining bag over SAM.
    
                             GUARD
               Don't fight it, son .... confess
               quickly ... Before they get into the
               expensive procedures. If you hold out
               too long you could jeopardise your
               credit rating.
    
    The bag blacks everything out.
    
    
133 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM                      133
    
    The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an
    Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back
    frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an
    unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of
    sight.
    
    The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange
    light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total
    disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately
    trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain
    tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.
    Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at
    hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions
    near the distant door they hand over documents to the
    white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.
    
                             GUARD
               11/AFT/607, sir.
    
    They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains
    after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then
    proceed to the door and take up positions on either side
    of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see
    he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.
    A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching
    him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the
    I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.
    After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the
    impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the
    GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep
    breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more
    briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and
    fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is
    covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he
    blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto
    the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?
    
    The I.R. OFFICER reacts to this as if he's been hit in the
    solar plexus, and he tries to disguise it by simulating a
    coughing fit. He then picks up a nasty looking implement
    and advances on SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?... Jack?
    
                             JACK
                    (hysterically from behind
                    mask)
               Shut up!
    
                              SAM
               Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
    
                             JACK
               Bastard!!!
    
                              SAM
               This is all a mistake. Jack, please
               take that mask off.
    
    JACK is very close to SAM, he is shaking. He lifts up his
    mask to reveal sweaty face, contorted with fear and anger.
    
                             JACK
               You stupid bastard!
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JACK
               How could you do this to me?
    
                              SAM
               Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
    
                             JACK
               How do you think I feel? You shit!
    
                              SAM
               Jack ...
    
                             JACK
                    (pulling down mask)
               Shut up! This is a professional
               relationship!
    
    JACK comes at SAM with the horrifying implement.
    
                              SAM
               JACK!! ... You can't ... No, don't!
    
    SAM's eyes widen in terror. From his POV we look up at
    JACK approaching. The ceiling above and behind JACK is
    suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole
    Machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's
    pole", the commando-like figure of MR TUTTLE gun in hand,
    leaps through the hole.
    TUTTLE is immediately followed by similar looking MEN with
    balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient
    guns. JACK is cut down. So are the TWO GUARDS who have
    opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into
    the room.
    
    TUTTLE raps out into a walkie-talkie
    
                            TUTTLE
               Detonate!
    
    From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion
    which rocks the room. TUTTLE is already unstrapping SAM.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Let's go!
    
    
134 INT.   CORRIDORS                         NIGHT         134
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, with SAM in the middle, fighting their
    way in the terrific battle with GUARDS, until they get to
    a door leading to the stairs.
    
    
135 INT.   ENDLESS STAIRWAYS                 NIGHT         135
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, their members thinning, and SAM, fighting
    down flight after flight of stairs with lots of neat-oh
    violence and blood and, gunshots and ... falling and
    bleeding and -
    
    
136 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY       NIGHT          136
    
    CUT to the RESCUERS fighting their way to the entrance.
    Another group of RESCUERS at the door are providing cover
    fire The PORTER sits behind his desk watching the battle
    on his bank of monitors.
    
                           2ND GROUP
    
               Quick! We've only got thirty seconds
               to get clear!
    
    TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey
    detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out
    through the door into the large empty forecourt.
    
    
137 EXT.   FORECOURT                         NIGHT          137
    
    The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.
    Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are
    totally exposed.
    
    They are cut down left and right.
    Desperately they battle their way across the open space.
    Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE
    towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last
    RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover.
    KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And
    another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated.
    SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits.
    Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a
    final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser
    of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and
    visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR
    HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.
    
    Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
    its load skywards. The night sky is full of white
    rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the
    city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He
    shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM
    and SAM runs.
    
    
138 EXT.   CITY PASSAGES                     NIGHT         138
    
    SAM runs madly through paper-littered passages
    
    
139 EXT.   SHOPPING                          PRECINCT     NIGHT139
    
    Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly
    lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of
    he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds
    casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business
    paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.
    Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way
    towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking
    against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds
    across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his
    foot. He tries shaking it off.
    
    It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the
    piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other
    leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the
    flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm.
    Still more paper blows against him. He is having
    difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he
    tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.
    He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe
    what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,
    apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from
    ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -
    and watches it career down the steps of the shopping
    precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon
    of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about
    on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from
    his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.
    The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind
    carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.
    But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few
    pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there
    with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he
    is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has
    stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS
    shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and
    dashes off.
    
    
140 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT         140
    
    The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM
    goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is
    empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind
    blows the curtains.
    
    
141 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  NIGHT         141
    
    The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling).
    SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes
    forwards.
    
    
142 INT. MOTHER'S FRONT DOOR NIGHT 142
    
    But it's MATTHEWS the porter who is at the door watching
    SAM running towards him.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (piously)
               A sad loss. Your mother was with her
               at the end. The doctor said there was
               no pain.
    
    SAM grabs MATTHEWS round the neck and shakes him.
    
                              SAM
               Where is she?
    
    
143 EXT    A CORNER                          NIGHT         143
    
    SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in
    a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There
    opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance
    to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from
    an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops
    and through the door.
    
    
144 INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT 144
    
    CUT to SAM slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and
    suddenly being confronted by SPIRO the Maitre D.
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It's so good you
               could make it. Right this way.
    
    SAM, dumbfounded, follows.
    
    CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern
    chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted
    up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit
    theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some
    sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands
    in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in
    stepped seats on three sides of the room.
    
    The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped
    the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large,
    rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking
    not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS
    JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.
    
    
    To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her
    hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the
    VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it,
    etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in
    the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (stopping and looking back
                    at Sam)
               Mrs Lowry? Mrs Lowry is ...
    
    In the background the VICAR begins speaking, and we hear
    his voice throughout the following action. CUT TO SAM'S
    POV ....
    
                     VICAR (in background)
               At these times of giving and
               receiving let's remember the greatest
               gift of all: not a gift to be
               spurned, not a gift to be opened and
               carelessly set on one side, not a
               gift to be taken back and changed,
               but the gift of eternal life. Mrs
               Terrain has just received that most
               wonderful of all gifts. She came to
               us physically new, she goes hence
               from us not so physically new. But
               the spirit never grows old. And in
               the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs
               Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy
               forever.
    
    ..... (CUT to SAM's POV) ... past SPIRO to a section in
    the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the
    VICAR where a WOMAN (her back to SAM) is surrounded by a
    buzzing flock of very handsome and well-dressed YOUNG MEN.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to take in scene)
               what? ... Oh ...
                    (starts to follow Spiro)
    
                             SPIRO
                    (coming up to back of
                    woman)
               Madam ...
    CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It
    is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years
    younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam!!!
                    (uncertainty in her
                    expression)
    
                              SAM
                    (staring dumbly, not
                    knowing what to say)
               Mother? ... What ... what's ...
               you've got to help me ...
    
                            MOTHER
                    (embarrassed, unsure)
               Not now ... please
    
                         YOUNG GALLANT
                    (belligerently)
               Ida, is this fellow bothering you?
                    (getting up)
               I'll -
    
    But before we can find out what he'll:
    
                             SFX:
               TERRIFIC CRASH.
    
    CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come
    crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The
    TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads
    for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes
    against the coffin which topples over spilling its
    contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his
    mouth and dashes through the door.
    
    
145 EXT.   MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES           NIGHT          145
    
    CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,
    hurting himself, getting up running.
    He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path
    seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.
    The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes
    deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top
    shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing
    FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The
    maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and
    right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.
    Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there
    is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead
    end.
    At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from
    the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair
    dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through
    this pile.
    
    
    Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He
    scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,
    TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.
    He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He
    actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to
    face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand
    touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The
    knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through
    it.
    
    
146 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT         146
    
    SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of
    furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
    frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is
    no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it
    shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit
    but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
    uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.
    He looks around but there is only one window and it is
    shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
    
    SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.
    
    
147 EXT.   CITY                              NIGHT         147
    
    JILL's truck, with the house on its back, is driving
    dangerously through he streets. It lurches round the
    corner.
    
    
148 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT          148
    
    - The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up,
    and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the
    shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,
    in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and
    finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He
    sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing
    JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs
    on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so
    that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He
    sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.
    SAM sobs with relief and love.
    
    
149 EXT.   THE ROAD                          NIGHT         149
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches then breasts
    the rise beyond which lies ... looking more than ever ...
    JILL'S VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a MIX ...
    
    
150 INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  NIGHT         150
    
    Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead.
    The reverse shot shows us JILL driving and SAM next to
    her. They glance at each other.
    
    
151 EXT.   SMALL ROAD                        EARLY MORNING 151
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then
    breasts the rise beyond which lies ... A STUNNINGLY
    BEAUTIFUL UNTOUCHED VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a
    MIX ...
    
    
152 EXT.   BEAUTIFUL VALLEY                  DAY           152
    
    Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with
    the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown
    up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke
    rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
    one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck
    has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
    vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some
    chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a
    basket of eggs.
    
    
153 INT.   HOUSE                             MORNING       153
    
    SAM is in the bed, just waking up. He opens his eyes,
    locking calm. Off screen we hear the door opening.
    
                       JILL (off screen)
               Morning. Sleep well?
    
    SAM nods his head slightly, on the pillow.
    
                              SAM
                    (quietly)
               I don't dream anymore.
                    (he embraces her)
    
    
154 EXT.   HOUSE AND GARDEN                  MORNING       154
    
    A high shot. Everything in the garden is definitely
    lovely. The music tells us. The music swells and the
    camera slowly pulls back, and back. It's a happy ending.
    And then, in the foreground, TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking
    straight at the camera. It is MR HELPMANN and JACK. They
    both shake their heads.
    
                          MR HELPMANN
               He's got away from us, Jack.
    
    CUT to their POV.
    
155 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM        DAY            155
    
    Sam is sitting in the IR chair. He is strapped in. His
    eyes are open but miles away. His face is wreathed in a
    benign and very happy smile.
    
                             JACK
               I'm afraid you're right, Mr.
               Helpmann. He's gone.
    
    A wide shot of the room shows us HELPMANN and LINT turn
    away and leave. SAM is left alone. He is humming.. The
    camera pulls back and back. The Information Retrieval room
    with SAM in it floats away into the most beautiful
    glorious sky ever.
    
    SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......
    
    
               "Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June,
               We stood beneath an amber moon,
               And softly murmured 'Some day soon'
               We kissed and clung together,
               Then, tomorrow was another day.
               The morning found me miles away,
               With still a million things to say,
               Now, when twilight beams the sky above,
               Recalling thrills of our love,
               There's one thing I'm certain of,
               Return, I will,
               To old Brazil."

    THE END

1   EXT.   CITYSCAPE                         SUNSET           1

    A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The
    CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises
    into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
    frame. The building is neither past nor future in design
    but a bit of both.
    
    Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
    below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated
    transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely
    huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule
    relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level
    awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent
    tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an
    elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of
    large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,
    the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs
    take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper
    levels of a plush shopping precinct.

2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT                  NIGHT            2
    
    Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,
    ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on
    display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly
    packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of
    elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one
    window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the
    screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister
    of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to
    listen to HELPMANN.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Deputy minister, what do you believe
               is behind this recent increase in
               terrorist bombings?

                           HELPMANN
               Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless
               minority of people seems to have
               forgotten certain good old fashioned
               virtues. They just can't stand seeing
               the other fellow win. If these people
               would just play the game, instead of
               standing on the touch line heckling -

                          INTERVIEWER
               In fact, killing people -

                           HELPMANN
               - In fact, killing people - they'd
               get a lot more out of life.

    We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.
    HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to
               those critics who maintain that the
               Ministry Of Information has become
               too large and unwieldy ...?

                           HELPMANN
               David ... in a free society
               information is the name of the game.
               You can't win the game if you're a
               man short.

    Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be
    banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow"
    turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop
    front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.
    WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood
    sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are
    being played by a Salvation Army style band calling
    themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is
    busy, all is well with the world.

                          INTERVIEWER
               And the cost of it all, Deputy
               Minister? Seven percent of the gross
               national produce ...

                           HELPMANN
               I understand this concern on behalf
               of the tax-payers. People want value
               for money and a cost-effective
               service.

3   INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT            3

    CUT TO TV screen with HELPMANN still talking.

                           HELPMANN
               That is why we always insist on the
               principle of Information Retrieval
               Charges. These terrorists are not
               pulling their weight, and it's
               absolutely right and fair that those
               found guilty should pay for their
               periods of detention and the
               Information Retrieval Procedures used
               in their interrogation.

    PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests
    on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-
    tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He
    comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to
    discover a shiny, metal "executive toy".

    CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.

    The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as
    it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some
    paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.

Scenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.

13  INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT           13
    
    The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his
    desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE
    still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath
    him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away
    compiling a typed list of names under the heading
    "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &
    Interview". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper
    which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic
    guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate
    sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet
    following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-
    UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in
    the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.
    ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER,
    John D. ... Every name begins with T.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Do you think that the government is
               winning the battle against
               terrorists?

                           HELPMANN
               On yes. Our morale is much higher
               than theirs, we're fielding all their
               strokes, running a lot of them out,
               and pretty consistently knocking them
               for six. I'd say they're nearly out
               of the game.
               
    The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the
    desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE. Swish, swash, oops,
    WHAP! Gottcha!!

                          INTERVIEWER
               But the bombing campaign is now in
               its thirteenth year ...

                           HELPMANN
               Beginner's luck.

    The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on
    the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the
    TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the
    BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops
    silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,
    hesitates and then types the letter "B" and hesitates and
    then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.

    The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine
    continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW,
    Peter...

                          INTERVIEWER
               Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

                           HELPMANN
               Thank you, David ... and a very merry
               Christmas to you all.

14  EXT.   HOUSING TOWERS                    NIGHT           14
    
    ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we
    TIGHTEN in on one of several massive residential tower
    blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of
    the city

15  INT.   BUTTLE FLAT                       NIGHT           15
    
    HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits
    rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune.
    PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional
    sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out
    the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
    snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller
    conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
    services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the
    metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but
    proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading
    Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.
    BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
    action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting
    the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present
    which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just
    seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.

    Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of
    the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the
    floor above.

16  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           16

    The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming
    from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt. Bilko. From
    BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom
    straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the
    person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath
    is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she
    watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror,
    the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body
    of a MAN in uniform.

                             JILL
                    (scared)
               Who's there?

17  INT.   BUTTLE'S FLAT                     NIGHT           17
    
    The BUTTLE FAMILY as before. MRS BUTTLE is closing the
    book.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               There, that's enough for tonight. He
               won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get
               plenty of sleep.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Father Christmas can't come if we
               haven't got a chimney.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               You'll see.

    The GIRL exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and
    leaves the room.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               How will he get down from upstairs?

                          BOY BUTTLE
               It's a secret.

    We follow GIRL BUTTLE out of the sitting room into ...

18  INT.   HALLWAY AND CHILDREN'S BEDROOM    NIGHT           18

    GIRL BUTTLE enters her bedroom. There is little or no
    light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently
    lowering himself into the room from the direction of the
    ceiling.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
                    (unalarmed)
               You've come ...

    As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the
    figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,
    slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The
    pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the
    ceiling. Things become immediately clearer

19  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM               NIGHT           19

    Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash
    trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in
    the window from the outside and enters that way. Most
    alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the
    ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and
    through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide
    TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal
    and violent.
    
    BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike
    canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal
    clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back
    of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In
    seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL
    BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into
    the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy
    machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we
    see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has
    been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are
    viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the
    doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An
    OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front
    door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an
    official document. It goes something like this:

                           OFFICIAL
               I hereby inform you under powers
               entrusted to me under Section 47,
               Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number
               438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,
               residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri
               La Towers, has been invited to assist
               the Ministry of Information with
               certain enquiries, the nature of
               which may be ascertained on
               completion of application form
               BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this
               date, and that he is liable to
               certain obligations as specified in
               Council Order 173497, including
               financial restitutions which may or
               may not be incurred if Information
               Retrieval procedures beyond those
               incorporated in Article 7 subsections
               8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit
               information leading to permanent
               arrest - notification of which will
               he served with the time period of 5
               working days as stipulated by law. In
               that instance the detainee will be
               debited without further notice
               through central banking procedures
               without prejudice until and unless at
               such a time when re-imbursement
               procedures may be instituted by you
               or third parties on completion of a
               re-imbursement form RB/CZ/907/X ...

    ... and more of the same, most of which is part of the
    audible wall paper while the chaos reigns. As the front
    door slams behind the captive relative peace returns,
    broken by MRS BUTTLE's anguished sobbing.

                    this one of blue receipts)
                    (indicating place to sign)
               Same again please. Just there.

                    receipts)
               Press harder his time. Good.

                          MRS BUTTLE
                    (signing again)
               What is this all about?

                           OFFICIAL
                    (tearing out sheet from
                    pink book)
               That's your receipt for your husband.
                    (taking blue book from her)
               Thank you. And this is my receipt for
               your receipt.
                    (he turns to leave along
                    with troopers)

    JILL's shocked face appears looking down through the hole
    in the ceiling. The faces of the workmen BILL and CHARLIE
    also appear, above and behind her.

                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?

    The helmeted SECURITY TROOPS in Buttle's flat drop to
    defensive positions and swing their machine guns up
    towards the hole in the ceiling. All three faces retreat.
    
    
20  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           20
    
                            CHARLIE
                    (starting back from the
                    hole with Bill and Jill)
               Eh! Eh! Eh! We're Department of
               Works! Department of Works up here!
               Careful with those bloody things!
    
    JILL, CHARLIE and BILL are hustled aside by a SECURITY MAN
    who clears the fireman's pole from the hole. We can see
    the TROOPS in the room below leaving. A SECOND SECURITY
    man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window. He
    coils the rope up neatly and the TWO SECURITY MEN leave
    the flat.
    
                             BILL
                    (to Jill as they watch this
                    highly efficient operation)
               Don't take any notice, love, it's
               their training makes them like
               animals. Best in the world, though.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
                            CHARLIE
               Don't you worry love, we'll have
               everything shipshape in a jiffy.
    
                             BILL
               That's it. Nothing to worry about.
    
                            CHARLIE
               It's Buttle downstairs who can worry,
               eh?
    
                             JILL
               There must be some mistake ... Mr
               Buttle's harmless...
    
                             BILL
               We don't make mistakes.
    
    So saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with
    same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor. To
    his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the
    flat below.
                            CHARLIE
               Bloody typical, they've gone back to
               metric without telling us
               

20a INT.   BUTTLES' FLAT                     NIGHT          20a
    
    MRS BUTTLE stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
    flat. The KIDS wail. Slowly MRS BUTTLE collapses -
    slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we
    tighten into CLOSE UP of "Receipt".

                       JILL (off CAMERA)
               Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle?

21  INT.   RECORD CLERK'S POOL                               21
    
    We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT
    being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to
    reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
    desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each
    (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed
    under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
    the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk
    intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS
    bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of
    the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,
    tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is
    supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.
    Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and
    walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top
    of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.

    MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it
    behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each
    CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,
    and all the screens change to something which looks very
    like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly".

22  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             22
    
    MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his
    desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the
    console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number
    of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE
    say, "Turn around real slow, amigo". MR KURTZMAN turns
    around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his
    T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently
    flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which
    we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald". He opens the file
    and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.
    starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.
    He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash
    "Error, error, error". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.
    He presses an intercom.
                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (into intercom)
               Mr Lowry, will you step in here
               please?
               
    He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody
    comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over
    to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of
    CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
    whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in
    the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.

                          MR KURTZMAN
               Does anyone know where Lowry is?

    Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment
    later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the
    crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens
    the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.
    He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even
    more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit
    you're whupped, you drygulching scum". KURTZMAN explodes
    with anger, and presses the intercom again.

                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (Shouting into intercom)
               Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!

23  EXT.   SKY                               DAY             23
    
    CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-
    like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer
    we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood
    and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their
    flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.
    Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an
    outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI
    fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,
    banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice
    can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers,
    looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO
    face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised
    twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her
    face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly
    mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft
    billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises
    and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA
    GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that
    the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast
    landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the
    sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial
    ballet.
    
    Romantic music fills the soundtrack.
    
    SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as
    SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM
    begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy
    quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening
    rumble. SAM looks down.
    
    The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,
    monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and
    soars upwards with a mighty rush.
    
    CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into
    FRAME partially cutting her off from view.
    
    Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper
    breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another
    and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is
    being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless
    structures. And then she is finally lost from view
    somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.
    SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.
    No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with
    their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among
    these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only
    sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls
    plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound
    but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in
    this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something
    in the distance. far below him a dark procession is
    wending its way through the narrow passages... away from
    him.
    
    CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way
    past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister
    figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several
    heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal
    cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the
    cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside
    is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as
    if there were a breeze in constant attendance.
    
    CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.
    
    CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their
    tracks. They've seen something.
    
    CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between
    two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.
    
    CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.
    Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces
    are the same except for the manner in which they have
    decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly
    the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become
    long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others
    shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The
    FORCES are massed ready to charge.
    CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his
    wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.
    
    Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the
    constant dribble from their cracked mouths.

    CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.
    Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the
    fearsome horde. Unarmed!

    CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing
    madly.

    SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading
    field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time
    catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries
    a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!
    Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this
    boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing
    of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way
    through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,
    they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate
    SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way
    toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise
    behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of
    black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of
    flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces
    and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition
    emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM
    is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is
    stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks
    around - confused.

24  INT.   SAM'S BEDROOM                     MORNING         24

    TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand
    grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened
    room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.

                              SAM
               Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr
               Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is
               it?

    There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,
    incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.
    This sets of a series of other things ... The window
    shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps
    turn on in the bathroom ...

                              SAM
                    (into phone)
               The electronics here are up the
               spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry
               sir - I'll be there.

    SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
    moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is
    loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
    
    In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting
    room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a
    cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with
    SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM
    comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath
    taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-
    maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours
    a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this
    we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is
    functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been
    assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are
    built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal
    panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall
    panels have Central Services logos on them with the
    admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below. SAM has
    livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film
    posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures
    of wide beautiful vistas.

25  INT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LOBBY     DAY             25

    This is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental-style
    building. The lobby is a vast impressive space containing
    reception desks, fountains, statues etc. Prominent are the
    security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras,
    video screens and groups of SECURITY MEN who search all
    who enter. SAM is finishing going through Security when he
    meets JACK who is on his way out of the building.

                             JACK
               Sam!

                              SAM
               Jack!

                             JACK
               Long time no see!

                              SAM
               Well, since you disappeared up the
               ladder of Information Retrieval ... I
               don't expect to see you slumming in
               Records - what's the problem?

                             JACK
               Problem? - No problem - yes,
               everything's going fantastically
               well, wonderful, marvelous, great
               career prospects, Alison in great
               shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm
               on Security Level Five now, and Mr
               Helpmann relies on me more and more,
               yes, couldn't be better, I feel
               terrifically motivated and job-
               rewarded -
               
                              SAM
               You sound worried.

                             JACK
               Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,
               it's you. What happened to you, Sam?
               You were the brightest of us -

    As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit
    TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering
    the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on
    their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered
    and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM
    happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the
    over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE
    DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being
    replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where
    the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as
    she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so
    there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM
    GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK
    has been talking.

                             JACK
               What's the matter?
                               
                              SAM
               Sorry. Nothing.
                    (snapping out of it)
               See you - I'm going to be late.

                             JACK
                    (looking at his watch)
               You are late.

                              SAM
               Even later.

                             JACK
               Sam, your life is going wrong - let
               your friends tell you - Records is a
               dead end department, no Security
               Level worth a damn, it's impossible
               to get noticed -

                              SAM
               Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,
               wonderful - remember me to Alison -
               and the - er - twins.

                             JACK
               Triplets.
    
                              SAM
               Really? - God, how time flies!
    
    As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN
    standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them
    are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained
    the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
    type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the
    monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the
    Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on
    her.
    
    CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her
    hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a
    wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches
    her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in
    an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying
    to see what is written on the forms, peering over her
    shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.
    
                             JILL
               I want to report a wrongful arrest.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking at form)
               You want Information Adjustments.
               Different department.
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated but
                    controlled)
               I've been to Information Adjustments.
               They sent me here. They told me you
               had a form I had to fill in.
    
                            PORTER
               Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                            PORTER
               Is it stamped?
    
                             JILL
                    (producing Buttle receipt)
               Stamped?
    
                            PORTER
                    (examining receipt)
               No, there's no stamp on it. You see!
               I can't give you the form until it's
               stamped.
    
                             JILL
               Where do I get it stamped?
    
                            PORTER
               Information Adjustments.
    
    The radio-controlled camera noses right up to JILL's face
    as she turns. She swats the annoying thing with her stack
    of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and
    crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
    
    CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a
    deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated
    TECHNICIANS.
    
    
26  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             26
    
    SAM is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem
    while KURTZMAN looks on anxiously and ineffectually.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Perhaps the machine's on the blink!
               It keeps picking up old films. That
               can't he right, can it?
    
                              SAM
               It's not the machine. There's a
               mismatch on the personnel code
               numbers... Ah there we go! That's a
               B58/732 when it should be a T47/215
               ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06,
               debited against his account for
               electrical procedures, not Buttle.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh my God, a mistake!
    
                              SAM
               It's not our mistake!
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (eagerly)
               Isn't it? Whose is it?
    
                              SAM
               Information Retrieval.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh, good!
    
                              SAM
               Expediting has put in for electrical
               procedures in respect of Buttle,
               Archibald, shoe repair operative, but
               Security has invoiced Admin for
               Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
    
    SAM is still punching keys.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief! I don't know what I'd
               do if you ever got promoted.
    
                              SAM
               Don't worry.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               But if they did promote you
    
                              SAM
               I've told you before. I'd turn it
               down.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Would you really, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (churned up)
               You've been promoted.
    
    KURTZMAN hands SAM a sheet of printed paper. SAM takes the
    paper, not pleased, and glances at it.
    
    CLOSE UP of paper: "LOWRY, S. (RECORDS. MIN OF INF.)
    TRANSFER TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL - (Expediting, Security
    Level 3).
    
                           KURTZMAN
               It's your mother isn't it? Pulling
               strings again.
    
                              SAM
                    (explodes)
               What a BITCH!
    
    
27  INT.   DOCTOR'S OFFICE                   DAY             27
    
    CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a
    three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip
    on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on
    either side of her face. When I say several inches that's
    just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched
    like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to
    the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth
    her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over
    this freak show.
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs
               Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here
               ... and there ...
    
    CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like
    a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The
    cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised
    with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing
    table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands
    the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored
    his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It
    seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.
    There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all
    in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing
    around, raving.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I just wish you would stop
               interfering, mother! I don't want
               promotion. I'm happy where I am.
    
                            MOTHER
               No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson
               to you - he never had your brains but
               he's got the ambition. You haven't
               got the ambition but luckily you've
               got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann
               was very close -
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, Mrs Lowry, don't get upset
                    (so SAM)
               Please wait in reception, Mr Lowry,
               you're giving her wrinkles.
    
                            MOTHER
               You see!
    
                              SAM
                    (groans)
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now Mrs Lowry, try to relax. You must
               trust me. I'll make you twenty years
               younger ...
                               
                              SAM
               Huh!
                               
                            DOCTOR
                    (giving Sam a dirty look)
               ... twenty-five if we just drain the
               excess fluid from the pouches ...
    
                            MOTHER
               Dr Jaffe, you're a genius. Would you
               like to be Surgeon General? Four
               Star. I know everybody.
                               
                            DOCTOR
               Well they won't know you when I've
               finished with you.
               
    The DOCTOR reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured
    marker. He starts colouring up her face with strokes of
    different coloured markers.
    
                            DOCTOR
               First we must eliminate the excess
               derma ... so! ... Then the flaccid
               tissues under the eyes ... And now
               the forehead ... Zip! I lift the
               wrinkles and worry lines right up
               into the wi- into the hairline, comme
               ca ...
    
    SAM looks disgusted.
    
                            DOCTOR
               And now the template ... There ...
               there ... there ... Now a bit of
               sticky ... There we go!
                    (triumphantly)
               Already she is twice as beautiful as
               she was before - voila!
    
    The DOCTOR moves his body aside, revealing MRS LOWRY's
    face, covered with coloured lines and wrapped in
    cellophane held in shape by cellotape. SAM stares at her.
    
                              SAM
               My God, it works.
    
    
28  INT.   POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE)        DAY             28
    
    The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place
    while they are going through the sort of security checks
    familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the
    velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (in full flow)
               Mr Helpmann was very close to your
               poor father. He was very close to me.
               Still is. He'll take you under his
               wing at Information Retrieval. You'll
               like it when you get there.
    
                              SAM
               You're not listening, mother.
    
    A warning buzzer goes off as MOTHER's handbag goes thru
    security check. It turns out to have been activated by a
    gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it
    and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
    executive toy which we have seen twice before.
    
                            MOTHER
               It's a present for my son.
    
    She takes the toy back and hands it to SAM.
    
                            MOTHER
               I hope you like it. It's very
               exclusive.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                            MOTHER
               It's something for executives.
    
    At this point the MAITRE D arrives on the scene.
    
                           MAITRE D
               Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you
               again. Merry Christmas.
    
    He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. He
    looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite
    
                            MOTHER
               Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (blocking Sam's way)
               I'm sorry but ...
    
                            MOTHER
               You remember Samuel, my son.
    
                             SPIRO
                    {suddenly unctious)
               Oh, but of course ...
    
                            MOTHER
               We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
    
                              SAM
               Are we?
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
    
    SPIRO leads the way. SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the
    restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza
    New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,
    potted palms combine to impress us with their
    sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be
    made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate
    intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting
    across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating
    right through the middle of a particularly valuable-
    looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident
    wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their
    way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string
    quartet accompanying them.
    
    CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a
    wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking
    DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily
    distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage
    that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them
    (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are
    perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.
    
                              SAM
               Mother, I thought we were going to be
               able to talk .... Oh God, she's got
               what's he name with her.
    
    SAM and his MOTHER arrive at the table.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Ida! Sam!
    
                            MOTHER
               Alma, how are you? You're looking
               wonderful! Hello, Shirley.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (shy to Sam)
               Salt?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (to Shirley)
               Not yet.
                    (to Sam and Mother)
               Happy Christmas, Sam.
    
    She hands SAM a gaily wrapped package which obviously
    contains the same executive toy.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sorry we're late. Shall we order? Get
               it out of the way. What are you going
               to have Alma?
    
    She starts to hunt through the huge menu the MAITRE D has
    just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid
    dishes available.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               I can't make up my mind whether to
               have a number one or a number two.
               What do you recommend, Spiro?
                               
                             SPIRO
                    (conspiratorially)
               Between you and me, Madam, today the
               number two.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are
               you going to have?
    
                            SHIRLEY

               Between you and me, Mademoiselle,
               today the number one. Madam Lowry?
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, to hell with the diet, a number
               eight, please.
    
                             SPIRO
               A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I
               may say so.
                    (to Sam)
               Monsieur?
    
                              SAM
                    (brusquely)
               A steak, please. Rare.
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, I need to ...
    
                             SPIRO
                    (piqued)
               Monsieur. Quel numero.
    
                              SAM
                    (handing back menu)
               I don't know which numero.

               Numero, trois.
    
    
    EVERYONE is a bit embarrassed here. MOTHER gives SAM a
    withering look. SPIRO stalks away.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (trying to restart things)
               Alma, you wicked thing ...
                    (indicating bandages)
               you've started your treatment.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               You noticed.
                    (enthusiastically)
               I must tell you all about it.
    
                              SAM
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, will you listen to
    
    At this moment the food arrives. SPIRO elaborately lifts
    off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the
    plates of food. Each order looks identical - a big splodge
    of brown lumpy stuff. The only differences between the
    lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in
    each. The beautiful colour photos match the photos which
    were on the menus.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (showing off that he
                    remembers who's ordered

                    MRS TERRAIN
               It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe
               and gone to Dr. Chapman.

                            MOTHER
               The acid man?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Really, Ida, just because his
               techniques are revolutionary ... I
               don't go around calling Dr Jaffe the
               knife man.

               I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to
               sound so ...

                          MRS TERRAIN
               That's all right Ida ... it's just
               that he's such an artist. To him,
               cutting is so crude ... so primitive.

               Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.

                          ALL BUT SAM
               Merci.

               Acid on the other hand, can be used
               for such wonderfully subtle shading,
               such delicate nuances - just like a
               Rembrant etching ... and it's so much
               quicker. Why, if it weren't for a
               teensy-weensy complication - the
               doctor said it could have happened to
               anyone - I would have had these
               bandages off yesterday.

                            SHIRLEY
                    (to Sam, after attracting
                    her mother's attention and
                    receiving a nod)
               Salt?
    
    They are just about to dip into their respective splodges
    when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is
    blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. Chaos erupts
    around the carnage as WAITERS try putting out the flames
    with extinguishers. PEOPLE, bloody and dying, are moaning.
    The DINERS not actually affected by the blast look up for
    a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to
    their meals.
    
    IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION.

                            MOTHER
               What were we saying?
    
                              SAM
                    (picking bomb debris out of
                    his brown lump)
               This isn't rare!
    
                            MOTHER
               By the way, I saw a wonderful idea
               for Christmas presents at the
               chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift
               tokens.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh, that sounds marvellous.
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes, they're good at any doctor's and
               at many of the major hospitals - and
               they're accepted for gynecological
               complications including Caesarian
               section.
    
    SAM, in the act of taking in another forkful of his
    unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust
    
                              SAM
               Look - please - I'm sorry - but
               honestly, mother, this is -
    
                            MOTHER.
               I quite agree! - It's impossible!
    
    MOTHER raises her arm to gain the attention of the MAITRE
    D who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency.
    The activity in the background has increased throughout
    the conversation. The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens
    blaring. Ministry TROOPS have charged in and are arresting
    WAITERS. Stretchers have been bought in for the injured
    and these are being rushed past our little GROUP's table.
    The MAITRE D comes to the table, his DJ now blood-
    spattered.
    
                           MAITRE D
               I am sorry, Madam ... I don't know
               what to say ... this very rarely
               happens to us - I'll do what I can
               straight away
    
    He hurries away.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Really, Sam - when are you going to
               do something about these terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

                            MOTHER
               Actually, Alma, that's one of the
               little things I was dying to tell you
               ... Sam's been promoted to
               Information Retrieval.

                              SAM
                    (angry and surprised)
               Mother!

                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh that's wonderful! Congratulations
               Sam...

                            SHIRLEY
               You can show those fucking murderous
               bastards a thing or two.

                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (shocked and embarrassed)
               Shirley!
    
                              SAM
               Stop this!
                    (leaping to his feet)
               I'm not being promoted. I'm not going
               to Information Retrieval!
                    (he scrumples promotion
                    notification which he has
                    been holding and throws it
                    on the floor)
               If I want you to stick your oar in,
               mother, I'll tell you where to stick
               it!
    
    EVERYBODY is shocked. He recovers his composure slightly.
    Embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper
    which he starts smoothing back into Its flat state.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (back to her uncertain
                    form)
               Pepper...?
    
                              SAM
               Look - I've got to get back -
    
    As SAM goes, MAITRE D reappears with a group of WAITERS -
    those remaining unarrested - whom he has organised to gut
    up a folding screen around the table. This cuts of the
    sight if not the noise of the VICTIMS of the explosion.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
    
                              SAM
               I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I
               don't want promotion. I don't want
               anything.
    
                            MOTHER
               Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course
               you want something. You must have
               hopes, wishes, dreams.
    
    Their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to
    rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts loud)
               NO, NOTHING. NOT EVEN DREAMS!
    
29  EXT.   BRILLIANT SKY                     DAY             29
    
    SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining
    as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They
    are rising up and away from the monolithic stone
    skyscrapers that stretch away below them.
    
                              SAM
               I'm taking you to a safe place. A
               place where they will never be able
               to get at us ... ever.
    
    An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is
    but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming
    a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and
    the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent
    just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -
    about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he
    comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises
    from the centre of this bizarre place.
    
                              SAM
               There's no way they can approach us
               without being seen. You're safe here.
    
    He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his
    wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a
    terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.
    
    A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere
    beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the
    camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and
    down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is
    heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.
    All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over
    the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks
    from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at
    right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with
    a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is
    heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding
    against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid
    pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out
    from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in
    its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends
    upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky
    is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is
    frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on
    above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and
    that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after
    block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the
    light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save
    her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the
    platform but it's too late.
    
    Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of
    sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and
    out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be
    heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a
    searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The
    laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something
    black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that
    appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible
    flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.
    
    He is engulfed in the black awfulness.
    
30  INT. SAM'S BEDROOM                       NIGHT           30
    
    SAM is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. He is
    dripping with sweat and screaming. The room is
    oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.
    It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's
    stuck.
    
    CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to
    the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to
    be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the
    kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the
    window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.
    GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in
    through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and
    madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he
    tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He
    makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall
    gasping for air.
    CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back
    as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him
    dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open
    refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.
    
                              SAM
                    (into phone)

    SAM slams the phone down.
    
    CUT to SAM sitting in front of the refrigerator. The door
    is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a
    desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head
    slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions
    falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.
    
31  EXT.   DARKNESS                          NIGHT           31
    
    The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are
    not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through
    space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the
    pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch
    cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the
    intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped
    and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected
    by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is
    escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM
    is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the
    tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a
    small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his
    shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way
    and SAM crashes through.
    
    CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He
    catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms
    back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on
    a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch
    he came through was the front of one of the millions of
    files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back
    into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for
    hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other
    walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is
    it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time
    Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being
    tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as
    sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.
    The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period
    costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a
    sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer
    platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the
    side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN
    (as seen on TV).
    
                             GENT
               Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
    
                              SAM
               What? How do you know my name?
    
                             GENT
               We know everything here. This is the
               Storeroom of Knowledge.
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing onto the
                    platform)
               Then perhaps you can help me. I've
               lost someone who ...
    
                             GENT
                    (interrupting)
               We know that too. You've come to the
               right place.
    
    The platform carries them along the files.
    
                             GENT
               Oh, yes. We've got everything here.
               Every bit of knowledge, wisdom,
               learning ... every experience, every
               thought neatly filed away.
    
                              SAM
                    (incredulous)
               What? You mean you've got ...
    
                             GENT
               Well not exactly. But, if you help us
               we'll help you. The Forces Of
               Darkness have won the day ... but,
               tomorrow is another one
    
                              SAM
               What do I have to do.
    
                             GENT
               You must save the day.
    
    The platform has stopped. The GENT pulls out a drawer. He
    reaches inside.
    
    The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.
    
                             GENT
               This is the Sword Of Truth ... and
               this the Helmet Of Justice.
    
    As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a
    cape.
    
                             GENT
               And this. completes the outfit.
    
    He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step
    into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs
    the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just
    like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer
    in.
    
                             GENT
               It won't be pleasant but, trust me.
    
    As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of
    claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he
    is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but
    a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM
    struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.
    
32  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           32
    
    SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the
    defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes
    up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone
    rings. He staggers over to it.
    
                              SAM
               Hello ... hello ...
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Hello. Mr Lowry?
    
                              SAM
               Who's that?
                    (pause)
    
    A sound at the kitchen door turns SAM's head - and ours -
    just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but
    then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back.
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Put the phone down and your hands up.
    
                              SAM
                    (into the phone)
               What? Who is this?
    
    SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind
    him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle-
    aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes
    suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid
    commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The
    other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is
    in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his
    feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Nice and easy now. Keep your hands
               where I can see them.
    
                              SAM
               What is this?
                    (indignantly)
               Who the hell are you?
    
    TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors,
    leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.
    
    TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At
               your service.
    
                              SAM
               Tuttle! Are you from Central
               Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Ha!!
    
                              SAM
               But ... I called Central Services.
    
                            TUTTLE
               They're a bit overworked these days.
               Luckily I intercepted your call.
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
    By now, BOTH are pouring with sweat.
    TUTTLE heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a
    wall panel.
    
                              SAM
               Wait a minute, what was that business
               with the gun?
    
    TUTTLE hands SAM the panel and plunges his arm into the
    space behind it.
    
                            TUTTLE
               A little precaution, sir. I've had
               traps set for me before now. There
               are people in Central Services who'd
               love to get their hands on Harry
               Tuttle.
    
                              SAM
               Are you saying this is illegal?
    
    By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of
    flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal
    behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and
    greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where
    that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he
    works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes
    ... BRAZIL!!
    
                            TUTTLE
               Well, yes ... and no. Officially,
               only Central Service operatives are
               supposed to touch this stuff ...
               Could you hold these.
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (he hands Sam a bunch of
                    wires that he has detached)
               ... but, with all the new rules and
               regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon
               ... they can't get decent staff any
               more ... so ... they tend to turn a
               blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.
                    (he hands Sam a torch)
               ... Mind you, if ever they could
               prove I'd been working on their
               equipment ... well, that's a
               different matter ... up a bit with
               the torch, sir.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to
               work for Central Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're
               getting warm -
    
                              SAM
               The pace?
    
                            TUTTLE
               The paperwork, couldn't stand the
               paperwork.
                    (indicating the torch)
               Over to the left please, if you don't
               mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's
               more bits of paper in Central
               Services than bits of pipe - read
               this, fill in that, hand in the other
               - listen, this old system of yours
               could be on fire and I couldn't even
               turn on the kitchen tap without
               filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody
               paperwork.
    
                              SAM
                    (mildly)
               Well I suppose one has to expect a
               certain amount
    
                            TUTTLE
               Why? I came into this game for
               adventure - go anywhere, travel
               light, get in, get out, wherever
               there's trouble, a man alone. Now
               they've got the whole country
               sectioned of and you can't move
               without a form. I'm the last of a
               breed. Ah ha! Found it!
                    (he holds up a small
                    charred gadget)
               There's your problem.
    
                              SAM
               Can you fix it?
    
                            TUTTLE
               No. But I can bypass it with one of
               these
    
    He pulls another gadget from his bag.
    
                              SAM
               Fine.
    
    The door bell. TUTTLE grabs for his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Are you expecting anyone?
    
                              SAM
               No. Wait here.
    
    He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the
    front door which he opens. He is confronted by two
    officious little men in boiler suits who are standing
    outside his door. Their names are SPOOR and DOWSER. DOWSER
    is SPOOR's echo.
    
                              SAM
               Yes?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ervices.
    
                              SAM
               Uh - what? - I ...
    
                             SPOOR
               You telephone, sir.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...elephoned sir.
    
                             SPOOR
               Trouble with your air-conditioning.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ditioning.
    
                              SAM
                    (gulps)
               No, not at all. I mean, it's all
               right. It's fixed.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed?
    
                            DOWSER
               Fixed?
    
    They don't like that.
    
                              SAM
               I mean it fixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed itself.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Machines don't fix themselves.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... fix themselves.
    
                             SPOOR
               He's tampered with it, Dowser.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ampered. with it, Spoor.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm sorry about your wasted
               journey
    
    SAM tries to close the door but SPOOR prevents this.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Dowser)
               I think we'd better have a look.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... have a look.
    
                              SAM
               No you can't.
    
    He is pushed aside. SPOOR followed by DOWSER, heads for
    the door behind which is MR TUTTLE. SAM is paralysed.
    SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous. He turns
    the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. The
    door begins to swing slowly open. SAM suddenly finds
    inspiration.
    
                              SAM
               Just a minute!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER turn round as the door continues to swing
    open. When the door is open, behind their backs TUTTLE is
    seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees
    slightly bent. TUTTLE freezes like that, pointing his
    pistol through the open door.

                              SAM
               Have you got a 27B/6?
    
    DOWSER looks very angry. Veins stand out on his forehead
    and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. SPOOR
    knocks him to the ground.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Sam)
               Now look what you've done to him.
    
                              SAM
               Have you got one or haven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
               Not ... as such ...
    
    DOWSER moans and begins to get back on his feet.
    
                             SPOOR
               But we can get one.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (worried about Dowser)
               It's all right, Terry, it's all
               right, everything's all right.
    
                              SAM
                    (ushering them to the door)
               I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a
               stickler for paper work. Where would
               we be if we didn't follow the correct
               procedures?
    
                             SPOOR
               We'll be back.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Be back.
    
                              SAM
                    (Closing the door on them)
               Thank you.
    
    SAM turns back to TUTTLE who is coming forward pocketing
    his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Thanks, Lowry, you're a good man in a
               tight corner.

    TUTTLE returns to work, fitting in the new by-pass gadget
    and tightening the nuts, and happily humming "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
               Listen .. um ... I don't want to get
               involved in any of this. But I work
               at the Ministry of Information, and I
               happen to know that Information
               Retrieval have been looking for an
               Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer.
               You wouldn't by any chance be -
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (pleased)
               My friends call me Harry. Information
               Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
    
                              SAM
               What do they want you or?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Time to go.
    
    TUTTLE finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you very much. How much will
               it...?
    
                            TUTTLE
               On the house. You did me a favor.
               Check the corridor.
    
    SAM goes to the front door, opens it and looks out.
    
                              SAM
               All clear.
    
    TUTTLE slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor.
    
                              SAM
               Hey that's a dead end.
    
    But TUTTLE merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings
    Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-
    story void to a neighboring block. SAM is amazed - not to
    say - stunned.
    
33  INT.   RECORDS POOL                      DAY             33
    
    SAM is at his desk among all the desks. Documents are
    being delivered right, left and centre through the vacuum
    tubes. All the CLERKS are busy. The screens are devoted to
    their proper use. All this activity is explained by the
    fact the MR KURTZMAN's door is wide open. At the next desk
    is another CLERK much like SAM, his NEIGHBOUR.
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               I think Kurtzman getting is
               suspicious.
    
                              SAM
               What have we got on today?
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               Casablanca.
    
    KURTZMAN appears in his doorway.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (calls out)
               Mr Lowry! Would you step in here a
               moment please.
    
    We go with KURTZMAN as he closes the office door behind
    him, we are now in ...
    
    
34  INT.   KURTZMAN'S OFFICE                 DAY             34
    
    KURTZMAN is pacing anxiously. SAM walks into the office.
    During the brief opening and closing of the door we just
    manage to hear the piano player in "Casablanca" singing,
    "... a kiss is just a kiss ...". KURTZMAN is too worried
    to notice. He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if
    it were contagious. He waves it frantically as SAM enters.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Thank God you're here! We're in
               terrible trouble! Look at this! Look
               at this!
    
    He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking the paper)
               A cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               The refund for Tuttle!
    
                              SAM
                    (startled)
               Tuttle?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion
               from the word go! He's been wrongly
               charged for Electromemorytherapy and
               someone somewhere is trying to make
               us carry the can!
    
                              SAM
               I've never seen a Ministry cheque
               before.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               We've got to get rid of it! There's
               been a balls-up somewhere, and when
               the music stops they'll jump on
               whoever's holding the cheque!
    
                              SAM
               Send it to somebody else. Send it to
               Buttle. It's his cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I've tried that! Population Census
               have got him down as dormanted, the
               Central Collective Storehouse
               computer has got him down as deleted,
               and the Information Retrieval have
               got him down as inoperative ...
               Security has him down as excised.,
               Admin have him down as completed
    
                              SAM
               Hang on.
    
    SAM sits down at the console and punches keys. He does
    this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally
    demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves KURTZMAN
    way out of his depth, until -
    
                              SAM
               He is dead.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll
               never get rid of the damned thing!
               What are we going to do?
    
                              SAM
               Try next of kin.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (a revelation)
               Next of kin!
    
    SAM punches more keys.
    
                              SAM
               There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle.
               What's the number on the cheque?
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (reading it)
               27156789/074328/K.
    
    SAM has been efficiently punching this in.
    
                              SAM
               Into memory. Now ... Central Banking
               ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit
    
    SAM rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque
    into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. A job well
    done.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (fervently)
               Please don't come back! Please don't
               come back!
    
    Unfortunately KURTZMAN's prayers are not answered and the.
    vacuum tube returns almost immediately. SAM opens it up.
    From the computer screen comes a voice "Play it again,
    Sam" - SAM and KURTZMAN look at the screen. We get a quick
    glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to
    numbers.
    
                              SAM
               Problem. She doesn't have a bank
               account.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Well, that's it! I may as well go and
               hang myself! This sort of thing
               couldn't have happened before the
               stupid seventh tier reorganization!
               That was Simmons doing! And he and
               Jeffries always sit together at
               lunch! The bastards!
                    (he thumps his hand hard on
                    the desk top)
               Ow!
                    (He picks up the offending
                    cheque)
               Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the
               filing cabinet ... or destroy it ...
               burn it ... eat it ...
    
    Under this tirade SAM has begun to hum "BRAZIL" - not
    entirely sure what inspired him.
    
                              SAM
               You'd never get away with it.
               Besides, you can't do that to
               somebody's refund. It's Christmas.
               There is one more option.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (depressed. Not really
                    believing it)
               What?
    
                              SAM
               Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the
               cheque, tell her to sign her name on
               the back, cash it at the corner sweet
               shop.
    
    KURTZMAN is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               That's brilliant!
    
    SAM takes over. In no time at all he has battered away at
    the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and
    received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf
    of different coloured papers.
    
                              SAM
               I'll do it for you. Authorise the
               cheque. What's the address?
    
    KURTZMAN scribbles it down for him.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Here. What do I do next?
    
                              SAM
               Call the motor pool and authorise
               personal transport.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Of course, of course. Leave it to me.
               How do I authorize a cheque?
    
                              SAM
                    (separating the and blue
                    sheets)
               Here we are. Pink and blue receipts.
               All you've got to do is sign these
               and the back of the cheque.
    
    KURTZMAN takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers
    but his hand is giving him trouble.
    

                           KURTZMAN
                    (exhausted after all the
                    emotion)
               Oh God! I think I've broken a bone.
               What a pathetic thing I am.

                              SAM
               (taking the pen from him)
               Here.

    SAM signs the cheque and receipts. A big CLOSE UP shows
    that he is scribbling KURTZMAN's signature. SAM pockets
    the papers and the pen.

                              SAM
               That's it.

                           KURTZMAN
               You are good to me Sam.

                              SAM
                    (leaving)
               Don't mention it. See you later.

35  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             35
    CUT to SAM at the wheel of the little car, beetling along
    in a seemingly endless, tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and
    aft by huge buses, lorries and other carriers which
    literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road
    surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck.
    
    CUT to SAM in interior of the Messerschmidt. He is singing
    along to an obscure arrangement of "BRAZIL".
    
                             RADIO
                    (plays music for a moment
                    which then fades out)
               ... We interrupt this programme to
               bring you news of a terrorist bombing
               at the ...
                    (Sam switches off)
    
    
36  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             36
    
    CUT to exterior view of Messerschmidt still merrily
    progressing in arterial tunnel. CUT to very tiny exit
    sign: Exit 49.
    
    CUT to SAM peering at sign.
    
    CUT to Messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry
    roars by.
    
    
37  EXT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             37
    
    Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
    sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's
    model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
    of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -
    graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the
    background is the grim reality of the massive housing
    tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow
    of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge
    conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out
    of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a
    few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then
    at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit
    pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.
    
                              SAM
                    (super polite)
               Excuse me. Can you tell me ...
    
    But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.
    
                              KID
               Eff off.
    
    SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.
    
    He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the
    little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of
    the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the
    car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.
    
    
38  INT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             38
    
    CUT to SAM hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby
    of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in
    evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the
    button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the
    lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors
    apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them -
    still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM
    can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old
    furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns
    towards the stairs.
    
    
39  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             39
    CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On
    the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the
    corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but
    then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to
    knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles
    for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.
    
               SAM
               Mrs Buttle
                    (silence)
               Uh, Mrs Buttle?
                    (silence)
    
    SAM stands not knowing what to do.
    SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts
    about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat.
    CUT to SAM's POV of darkish hall.
    
                              SAM
               Mrs Buttle ...
    
40  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING ROOM               DAY             40
    
    CUT to SAM entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded
    in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the
    FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is
    still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting
    absolutely still at a small table by the only (still
    broken) window in the room.
    
                              SAM
               Are you Mrs Buttle?
    
    The WOMAN nods very slightly without looking at him.
    
                              SAM
               My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm
               from the Ministry of Information.
                    (no response)
               I've come to give you a cheque.
    
    SAM takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the
    table to tempt MRS BUTTLE into a flicker of interest but
    she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. SAM
    pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she
    does not respond.
    
                              SAM
                    (indicting cheque)
               It's a refund ... I'm afraid there
               was a mistake.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               Mistake?
    
                              SAM
                    (encouraged)
               Yes. Not my department ... I'm only
               records. It seems that Mr Buttle was
               overcharged by Information Retrieval.
               I don't think they usually make
               mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose
               we're all human.
    
    SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
    
               Oh ... what happened to the ...?
    
    He gets nothing back.
    
               Actually, my bringing this here is
               rather unorthodox ... Usually any
               payments are made through the central
               computer ... but, er ... there were
               certain difficulties, and rather than
               cause delay, we thought you might
               appreciate this now ... it being
               Christmas.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               My husband's dead, isn't he?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the
               Ministry is always very scrupulous
               about following up and eradicating
               error. If you have any complaints
               which you'd like to make, I'd be more
               than happy to send you the
               appropriate forms.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               What have you done with his body?
    
                              SAM
               Um ...
    
    MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
               I don't know anything about it ...
               I'm really just delivering the
               cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind
               signing these receipts
                    (producing blue and pink
                    receipts)
               I'll go and leave you in peace.
    
    SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE
    together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and
    throws them in his face.
    
                              SAM
               Uh ...
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               He hadn't done anything ... He was
               good ... What have you done with his
               body?
    
    SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE
    standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a
    blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at
    SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the
    wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the
    floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his
    hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull
    the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on
    his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and
    shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the
    BOY.
    
    From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the
    floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's
    head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is
    unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems
    unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of
    mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.
    
                             JILL
               Are you alright?
    
                              SAM
                    (mumbles)
               It's you ... it's you ...
    
                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
    
    SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the
    angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the
    vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to
    realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,
    dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the
    ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only
    the empty space of the hole.
    
                              SAM
               Wait! Stop! Come back!!
    
    MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.
    
    
41  INT.   BUTTLE'S CORRIDOR                 DAY             41
    
    SAM looks both ways and heads for the stairs.
    
    
42  INT.   BUTTLE'S STAIRCASE                DAY             42
    
    SAM runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds
    himself in -
    
    
43  EXT.   SIMILAR CORRIDOR                  DAY             43
    
    He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the
    doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock
    at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is
    the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the
    door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at
    him.
    
                              SAM
               Girl ... fair hair ...
    
    The door shuts firmly. SAM rushes to the next door.
    
    
44  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       DAY             44
    
    SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the
    floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and
    looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is
    apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is
    carrying a suitcase and bundles.
    
    
45  INT.   STAIRCASE                         DAY             45
    
    SAM rushes down the stairs.
    
    
46  EXT.   BLOCK OF FLATS                    DAY             46
    
    SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared.
    The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know
    which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the
    building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
    attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch
    him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry
    comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at
    the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouting)
               Wait! It was nothing to do with me!
    
    The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering
    three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up.
    He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all
    three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair
    and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him
    expressionlessly.
    
    They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.
    
    Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A
    shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL
    BUTTLE standing over him.
    
                              SAM
               Go away.
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Her name is Jill.
    
                              SAM
               What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Layton.
    
                              SAM
               Jill Layton ...
                    (getting up)
               You're a very good little girl. What
               are you doing here?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               I'm waiting for my daddy.
    
                              SAM
                    (uncomprehending)
               He will be pleased when he comes
               home.
    
    GIRL BUTTLE doesn't answer and SAM starts to walk away.
    After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back
    to look at the little GIRL BUTTLE who stands alone
    patiently in the vandalised wilderness.
    
    
47  INT.   RECORD CLERKS POOL                DAY             47
    
    It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily
    getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last
    one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with
    his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He
    sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his
    computer console. Totally absorbed in what he is doing.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh ... Sam. I've had the transport
               pool onto me ... You don't know
               anything about a personnel
               transporter gone missing do you?
    
    SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a
    front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code
    number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up
    personal dossier information like "age", "height",
    "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes",
    "distinguishing marks" etc.
    
                              SAM
                    (preoccupied)
               A "personnel" transporter? They've
               got it wrong. I had a personal
               transporter. I'll do the paperwork
               tomorrow -
    
    SAM punches up a few more categories for JILL's dossier.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's
               cheque?
    
                              SAM
               I delivered it.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Can I forget it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
    SAM punches a few more buttons on the computer.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief!
                    (on reflection)
               I shall probably have nightmares.
    
    At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself
    over most of the screen and "IRQ/3" starts agitating at
    the bottom
    
                              SAM
               Damn! Blast!
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What's the matter?
    
                              SAM
               You don't happen to know how I can
               get around an IRQ/3 do you?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All information on 3rd Level Suspects
               is classified.
    
                              SAM
               I know that.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All enquiries to Information
               Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of
               course. They never tell you anything.
               But come the time they want something
               from us ...
    
    Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching
    keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches
    in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view
    computer portrait rolls out as SAM ponders his options.
    
                              SAM
                    (cutting off Kurtzman)
               I've go to accept that promotion to
               get behind this, haven't I?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Yes.
                    (realising what he's
                    suggesting)
               NO! You can't! You've only just
               turned it down!
                    (thinking Sam is joking)
    
                              SAM
               I never signed the form.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I did it for you.
    
                              SAM
               What! Shit!
               
                           KURTZMAN
               It's what you wanted isn't it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
    
    KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He
    grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Come on, before they turn the lights
               out.
    
    SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and
    follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some
    distance away, and before they get there all the lights go
    out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.
    
    
48  INT.   TRANSPORT CAGE                    EVENING         48
    
    Packed tightly between other passengers SAM is busy
    drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer
    print-out of JILL turning her into the DREAM GIRL. The
    transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a
    tower block.
    
    
49  INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    EVENING         49
    
    The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end
    of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for
    various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get
    off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he.
    Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about
    something he heads for his own front door.
    
    
50  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        EVENING         50
    
    SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing
    panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown
    mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
    disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying
    to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring
    plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is
    not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
    banging going on somewhere behind the wall.
    
                              SAM
               What the - ? How did you - ?
    
                             SPOOR
               Emergency procedures.
    
                         DOWSER (O.S.)
                    (muffled)
               ...ergency procedures.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I haven't got an emergency. Get out
               of here.
    
    For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
    and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central
    Services, claiming "an emergency". SPOOR shuts off his
    machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what
    looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper
    between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here please.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (surprised)
               It's a 27B/6, what did you think it
               was?
    
    SAM takes out KURTZMAN's old-fashioned fountain pen from
    his pocket, signs where indicated. SPOOR registers that
    SAM's signature has hardly penetrated through he first
    carbon let alone the other 43
    
                             SPOOR
                    (sourly)
               Haven't you got a ballpoint?
    
    SAM resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by
    one. SPOOR realises that DOWSER's echo has gone missing.
    
                             SPOOR
               Now where's he got to?
                    (shouts)
               Dowser!
    
    DOWSER bursts through a panel in the wall. This is the
    panel which TUTTLE had removed and replaced. A few of the
    flat's intestines have come out with DOWSER. DOWSER has
    made a find - TUTTLE's spare part.
    
                             SPOOR
               What have you got there?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (highly excited)
               Got there!
    
    DOWSER points to TUTTLE's spare part which is hanging out
    of the wall attached to rubber tube. SPOOR examines this
    closely. SAM watches alarmed. The TWO MEN go into a
    mumbling huddle.
    
                             SPOOR
               Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ...
               Tuttle
    
                            DOWSER
               Mumble ... Tuttle ...
    
                             SPOOR
               Tuttle! ... mumble!
                    (to Sam)
               You've had that scab Tuttle here,
               haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...aven't you?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             SPOOR
               Who fixed your ducts?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...your ducts?
    
                              SAM
               I fixed it myself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh
                    (he holds up Tuttle's spare
                    part)
               out yer nostril?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Yer nostril?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services don't take kindly to
               sabotage!
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sabotage!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER and the other workmen gather up their
    tools - put them in the bag, grab everything else that
    belongs to them and are leaving. SPOOR grabs the form-book
    out of SAM's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that
    page at SAM, shoves the book into his bag. The WORKMEN
    begin leaving the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't
               just go and leave it like this!
    
                             SPOOR
                    (mock innocent)
               Why not? All you've got to do is blow
               yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (leaving)
               You're putting your talents to very
               odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to
               pit wits against Central Services -
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sod you, stupid twit.
    
    They go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving SAM in the
    ruins of his flat.
    
    SAM stands in the maimed sitting-room. Wall panels are
    off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room
    like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a
    couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently
    hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the
    print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the
    DREAM GIRL.
    
    
51  EXT.   CONDUIT FOREST                    NIGHT           51
    
    DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to
    reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest
    of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through
    the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.
    Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering
    before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke
    and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.
    
    
52  EXT.   CLOUDS                            NIGHT           52
    
    CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape
    twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it
    clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape
    up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out
    until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.
    Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.
    
    
53  EXT.   STRANGE LANDSCAPE                 ANTI-DAY        53
    
    SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange
    mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the
    occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long
    lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant
    cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The
    black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the
    PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.
    The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.
    The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a
    black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.
    
    CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards
    the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,
    destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them
    forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a
    stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear
    raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS
    turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -
    a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We
    see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is
    MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and
    the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.
    A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the
    sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.
    But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins
    to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a
    mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and
    the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the
    opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black
    flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high
    into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into
    the light. There, under several meters of the earth's
    crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful
    blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen
    in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the
    crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet
    high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient
    Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he
    made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a
    horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that
    was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of
    Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is
    unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being
    loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face
    the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands
    ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in
    an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does
    the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees
    that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter
    from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the
    ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the
    ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black
    flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the
    trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is
    severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking
    around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned
    cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and
    begins chopping the tethers away.
    The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last
    restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but
    before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg
    halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is
    caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.
    Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the
    smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The
    face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to
    the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.
    
                   MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND
               Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what
               she seems.
    
    SAM kicks and strains but the hands hold firm.
    
    
54  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           54
    
    SAM wakes up. His feet are entangled in some wiring and
    ducting. He is still in his devastated sitting room. As he
    untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment
    for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and
    still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the
    door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly
    bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and
    big-bowed tap dancing shoes. She launches into a terrible
    song and dance routine.
    
                        GIRL (singing)
               Mrs Ida Lowry requests the pleasure
                 of your companyyyy
                 at her apartment tonight,
               from eight thirtyyyy
                 midnight
               to celebrate the completion
                 of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy
               The guest of honour will be
                 Mr Conrad Helpmann,
               Dep. Under Minister of State
                 for Public Information,
               R.S.V.P. by singing telegram.
    
    SAM and the GIRL stand looking at each other uneasily for
    a moment.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... Thanks ...
    
                             GIRL
               It's reply paid.
    
                              SAM
               Oh ...
                    (he sings uncertainly)
               Thank you very much, mother, but
               actually -
    
                             GIRL
               You don't have to sing it.
    
                              SAM
               Oh, right ...
    
    The GIRL begins to dance again - but this time in a rather
    strange strangled fashion.
    
                              SAM
                    (he looks at his watch)
               Aren't you a bit late? - the party
               started half an hour ago.
    
                             GIRL
               Yes, I know. It's the backlog,
               everybody complains. Was it all right
               otherwise?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank
               you.
    
                             GIRL
               Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
    
    
55  INT.   MOTHER' S CORRIDOR                NIGHT           55
    
    SAM rings the doorbell to his mother's flat. He is
    wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his
    only dress outfit. The door is opened by a LIVERIED FLUNKY
    who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old
    woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses SAM
    over the threshold.
    
                             WOMAN
               Sam, I'm so glad you came. Do come
               in.
    
    
56  INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT           56
    
    SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.
    The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less
    formally dresses than SAM. It is an elegant baroque room -
    lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous
    Central Service ducts that thrust through antique
    tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for
    aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.
    
                              SAM
                    (bewildered)
               Mother? Is that you?
    
                            MOTHER
                    (taking his arm - looking
                    slightly askance at his
                    clothes)
               Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The
               bandages came of this afternoon. Come
               and join the fun. Everybody's here.
    
                              SAM
               Is Mr Helpmann here?
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
    
                              SAM
               I want to talk to him.
    
    SAM pushes away the FLUNKY who is by now passing a metal
    detector over him.
    
                            MOTHER
               It seems you're the first person ever
               to turn down a promotion. He thinks
               you should see a doctor.
    
                              SAM
               Actually, I've decided ...
    
    DR JAFFE hoves into view.
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, Louis! You know Sam.
    
    DR JAFFE is no longer suave. He has been transformed by
    drink and success. Mostly by drink.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (as high as a kite)
               Can you believe it?! Just me and my
               little knife! Snip - snip - slice -
               slice - Can you believe it?
    
                              SAM
                    (repelled)
               Congratulations ...
    
                           DR JAFFE
               And this is just the beginning!!
    
                              SAM
               Really?
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Chirst yes, you've seen her with her
               clothes off. Faces are a doddle
               compared to tits and arse.
                    (explains)
               No hairline.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (primly)
               Really, Louis.
    
    A handsome young piece of BEEFCAKE delivers a drink to
    MOTHER.
    
                           BEEFCAKE
               I've been looking everywhere for you,
               Ida.
    
    The BEEFCAKE takes MOTHER away.
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Ah, dear boy ... And what do you
               think of your mother now?
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               It will never last.
    
    SAM and DR JAFFE turn to see who is speaking. It is DR
    CHAPMAN a tall, pipe-smoking, professional-looking gent.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (a trifle haughtily)
               Excuse me, Dr Chapman, did you say
               something?
    
                          DR CHAPMAN
               That technique ... I've tried it. A
               nice effect. But highly unstable. In
               six months she'll look like Grandma
               Moses.
    
    SAM wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but
    suddenly freezes - the reflection in the large wall mirror
    next to him is not that of the party guests - but of the
    GREY PRISONERS in his dream - they are massed in the room
    looking pleadingly towards him.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (unsuave again)
               Now see here, Chapman. At least mine
               don't look like they've been mugged.
    
    Through the GREY PRISONERS pushes MRS TERRAIN.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (calls)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns around to see her pushing through the party
    guests.
    
    MRS TERRAIN is limping and is even more heavily swathed in
    bandages than the last time.
    
    DR CHAPMAN hastily moves away as MRS TERRAIN comes up. She
    claims SAM, taking his arm.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at her worriedly)
               Whatever happened to you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               There was a slight complication. Dr.
               Chapman says it often happens with a
               delicate skin like mine. Nothing to
               worry about. He's promised me I'll
               have these bandages off in a ...
                               
                              SAM
                    (trying to disengage)
               Actually, there's someone I want to
               meet ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (roguishly)
               I know, I know ...!
               
    She drags SAM through the party and we arrive at her
    daughter, SHIRLEY, who is, of course, a wallflower.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Here we are! I'm going to leave you
               two lovebirds in peace.
    
                              SAM
               I ... uh ...
    
    But he is alone with SHIRLEY, standing at the entrance to
    his MOTHER's embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom.
    In amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed
    MOTHER is playing hide and seek with a YOUNG STUD.
    
                              SAM
               Can I get you a drink, Shirley?
    
    SHIRLEY looks at him terrified.
    
                              SAM
               Look ... Shirley ... your mother ...
               and my mother ... they seem to have
               got the idea ... I mean, I'm terribly
               flattered, of course, but, um, the
               thing is, I don't want you to be
               under any false ...
                               
                            SHIRLEY
                    {struggling into speech
                    shyly)
               It's ... it's ... all right ... I
               don't like you either ...
    
    This isn't what SAM expected. He smiles weakly at her.
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns round, to see JACK LINT a few paces away.
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               You remember Alison?
    
    He indicates his cute blonde perfect junior executive's
    WIFE
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Alison. You look different.
    
                            ALISON
               Well, I'm two years older.
    
                             JACK
               And she's been to Dr. Jaffe!
    
    ALISON locks displeased.
    
                             JACK
                    {winking at Sam)
               She doesn't like me telling anyone
               but she's pleased as anything really.
    
                              SAM
               Er, I knew you looked different.
                               
                             JACK
               Remember how they used to stick out?
    
                              SAM
               What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to
               wonder if they were real.
    
                            ALISON
               What, my ears?
    
                              SAM
               Your ears?
    
                             JACK
               Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
    
                              SAM
                    (covering up hopelessly)
               Quite, absolutely - I always thought
               they were false.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking past Sam)
               Mr Helpmann!
    
    SAM spins round and sees a very pleasant-looking
    distinguished OLD MAN moving in their direction. He is in
    a wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Hello, Jack.
    
                             JACK
               You remember my wife ... Alis -
    
                           HELPMANN
               Of course. Barbara isn't it? How are
               you?
                            ALISON
               Um ...
    
                             JACK
                    (instantly. Conveying to
                    Alison that she mustn't
                    object)
               Barbara's very well, thank you, sir.
               How are you?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Fine, thank you. Hello, Sam. Ida said
               you might be here. Have you got a
               minute?
                    (to Jack)
               Would you excuse us?
    
    JACK is taken aback, envious and eager to please.
    
                             JACK
               Of course .... of course ... Come on
               Alison - Barbara
    
    JACK propels his WIFE away.
    
    HELPMANN I need your help, Sam.
    
    
57  INT.   BATHROOM                          NIGHT           57
    
    It's the sort of bathroom you would expect of MOTHER, an
    adjunct to her boudoir. The pink or purple lavatory is in
    the process of flushing, while SAM holds MR HELPMANN
    vertical, grasping him under the armpits, while MR
    HELPMANN is zipping his fly.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Thanks very much Sam.
    
                              SAM
               That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to
               help.
    
    He is lowering HELPMANN into the wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               If I can help you ...
    
                              SAM
                    (broaching the subject)
               Well, I ...
    
    In maneuvering HELPMANN SAM clumsily knocks over one of
    the pretty pots which fussily decorate MOTHER's bathroom
    shelf. A thin layer of powder is spread over the wash-
    stand.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry ...
    
                           HELPMANN
               Your father and I were very close. Of
               course Jeremiah was senior to me but
               we were close friends ... especially
               after the bombing
                    (he indicates his legs)
               and I
                    (chuckles)
               keep his name alive at the office
               every day.
    
    With his finger HELPMANN is tracing letters in the
    powdered surface.
    
                           HELPMANN
               It's as though he's there speaking to
               me - "'ere I am, J.H.!" The ghost in
               the machine.
    
    We see that HELPMANN has traced the letters EREIAMJH in
    the powder.
    
                           HELPMANN
               I know he would have wanted me to
               help you ... And I promised your
               mother I'd take you onto the team at
               information Retrieval. But I gather
               that ...
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind.
               I'd like to accept the transfer - am
               I too late?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Too late? That's for me to say.
                               
                              SAM
               Well ... well, I ...
    
    HELPMANN puts out his hand. SAM takes it.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Welcome to Information Retrieval!
    
    HELPMANN blows away the spilled powder and EREIAMJH with
    it.
    
Scene 58 deleted                               Scene 58 deleted

59  INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         DAY             59
    
    CUT to WIDE SHOT of massive imposing lobby - much like the
    Records lobby - but this one is very austere. No crowds.
    No statues. No decoration. Not even the ever-present
    security checks. Impressive. And a bit unnerving. Framed
    in the doorway is a lone TINY FIGURE. CUT to CLOSE UP.
    It's SAM. He hesitates and then enters. CUT to video
    screen. The video camera follows SAM across the lobby -
    til he stops in tight profile at Reception Desk. We tilt
    up revealing SAM standing facing us just beyond the
    monitor which is on the desk.
    
                              SAM
                    (diffidently to the porter)
               My name is Sam Lowry. I have to
               report to Mr Warren.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking down his nose at
                    Sam's unsleek clerk's suit
                    and then handing him an
                    I.D. badge)
               Thirtieth floor, sir. You're
               expected.
    
                              SAM
               Er, don't you want to search me?
    
                            PORTER
               No, sir.
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback. Reaching into
                    his pocket)
               My I.D. cards.
    
                            PORTER
               No need, sir
    
                              SAM
                    (nonplussed)
               But I could be anybody.
    
                            PORTER
               No you couldn't, sir. This is
               Information Retrieval.
                    (indicating to the right)
               the lift's arrived, sir.
    
    
60  INT.   30TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             60
    
    SAM steps out of the lift.The lift doors close. SAM looks
    up and down the corridor hearing nothing. Silence. Then
    he, and we, begin to hear a sound. It is a curious
    whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be
    growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into
    view around a corner at the far end of the rather long
    corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a
    magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This
    is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are
    competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of
    sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied
    EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals,
    disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors
    which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't
    get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other
    doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming
    by SAM at the rate of knots. The sound it makes breaks
    down into something like this.
    
                          EXPEDITER 1
                    (waving pager)
               Mr Warren, this order ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 2
                    (waving same)
               Mr Warren ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 3
                    (ditto)
               About this invoice ... Victim's list
               ...
    
                            WARREN
                    (dealing on all sides)
               Yes ... No ... send that back ...
               wrong department ... of course ... of
               course not ... yes ... no ... maybe.
    
    CUT to SAM watching this caravanserai with awe as it
    starts pass him.
    
                          EXPEDITER 4
               ... about these requisitions ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 5
               Mr Warren ... EX/27 has 15 suspects
               still outstanding.
    
                          EXPEDITER 6
               ... a decision, Mr Warren ...
    
                            WARREN
               ... cancel that ... okay ... put half
               as terrorists, the rest as victims
               ... yes ... yes ... no ... definitely
               no ...
    
    SAM doesn't have the nerve to jump into this. The scrum
    sweeps by and fades away along the corridor, and finally
    disappearing around the corner at the other end. SAM
    follows. Silence has descended again.
    
    
61  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             61
    
    SAM gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar
    corridor at right angles. He hesitates and continues. Then
    he starts to hear the sound again. It is coming up from
    behind. MR WARREN has circumnavigated the building. The
    same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace.
    As the scrum reaches SAM he gathers his nerve and jumps
    right in beside WARREN, and keeps going.
    
                              SAM
                    (in a hurry)
               I'm Lowry, Mr Warren ... Sam Lowry.
    
                            WARREN
                    (putting arm around Sam)
               Ah. Lowry ... yes.
                    (still dealing with
                    Expediters)
               ... no, cancel that ... glad to have
               you aboard ... yes ... no ... don't
               be ridiculous Jenkins ... Yes, yes,
               yes ... you'll like it up here ...
               send that back ... we've got a crack
               team of ... are they kidding? ...
               decision makers ... No, in triplicate
               ... I'm expecting big things ... two
               copies to Finance ... of you ... send
               that to Security ... uh, uh, uh.
                    (poring over forms)
               Uh, don't let Progress see this ...
               between you and me, Lowry, this ...
               no, no ... department ... tell
               Records to get stuffed ... is about
               to be upgraded and ...
    
    WARREN suddenly pivots around, swinging SAM 240 degrees in
    the direction they came from plus a bit.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, here we are!
                    (they are standing facing a
                    door - one of the hundreds
                    of identical doors lining
                    these corridors)
               What do you think?
    
    The door says: OFFICER DZ/015.
    
    SAM has no idea what he ought to say.
    
                            WARREN
                    (solemnly)
               Your very own number... on your very
               own door ... and behind that door
                    (he turns the knob and
                    opens the door)
               ... your very own office.
               Congratulations, DZ/015, welcome to
               the team.
    
    WARREN whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and EXPEDITERS
    leaving SAM standing dumfounded at the entrance to his
    office.
    
    CUT to SAM's POV of the office. It is about four feet
    wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is
    bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side
    wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which
    is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang
    from the ceiling. SAM slowly enters the room.
    
    
62  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             62
    
    SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to
    begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes
    in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
    starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. There in his
    "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -
    gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &
    Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up
    his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)
    against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM
    turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they
    both fall over with a "plop". Puzzled, he stands the books
    up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". Same result.
    Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before
    his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,
    and "plop", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold
    of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the
    wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,
    somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly
    pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.
    Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for
    the door.
    
    
63  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             63
    
    Cut to SAM coming out of his office, turning right and
    walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads:
    OFFICER DV/048.
    
    As is his custom, SAM opens the door without knocking.
    
    
63a INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY            63a
    
    CUT to SAM'S POV. Here is an office much like his. It's
    the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall.
    The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking,
    round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with
    trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. He
    is unaware of SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Hello.
    
    LIME startled, lets go of his desk and vents his
    irritation on SAM whom he mistakes for someone else.
    
                             LIME
               No, you can't have any more chairs!
               There's only one left in here now,
               and I need that to sit on!
                    (realizing his mistake)
               Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
    
                              SAM
               Sam Lowry.
    
                             LIME
                    (becoming unctuous)
               Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next
               door, ha ha!
                    (he advances toward Sam
                    with hand out to shake.
                    Shaking hands)
               My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome
               to Expediting.
    
                              SAM
               Ah.
                    (he pauses - looking
                    around)
               Would you mind if I borrowed your
               computer console?
    
                             LIME
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
    
                             LIME
               You want to take my console into your
               office?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
                             LIME
                    (after a moment's
                    consideration)
               I'll tell you what .... You tell me
               what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of
               a whizz on this thing.
                    (indicates computer
                    console)
    
    SAM hesitates, but sees that there's no other way.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out on Jill
                    from his pocket)
               Alright. There's someone I want to
               check out. A woman called Gillian
               Layton.
    
                             LIME
                    (leering)
               A woman eh? I see.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to ignore this)
               I know her age and distinguishing
               marks. But I need an address or a
               place of work or something
    
                             LIME
                    (continuing to leer)
               This is your dream girl, is it?
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback)
               What?
                    (recovering)
               Look, let me use the console for a
               few minutes.
    
                             LIME
                    (trying to be jocular)
               You must be joking -
                    (entirely unconvincing)
               When there's a woman involved -
               there's no stopping me. Now, let me
               have that sheet.
    
    He takes Jill's print-out sheet from SAM and begins to
    punch the keys laboriously with one finger. Nothing
    happens.
    
                             LIME
               Sod it, it's broken!
    
                              SAM
               You haven't switched it on.
    
                             LIME
               Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off,
               standing there! Go back to your
               office and I'll give you a knock when
               I've finished.
    
    SAM hesitates, but goes.
    
                             LIME
               Go on. I'm not going to elope with
               her.
    
    SAM exits.
    
    
64  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             64
    
    SAM is sitting in his office listening to the protracted
    one finger exercise which is going on next door. He stares
    dumbly at the shining, absolutely useless, executive toy.
    
    
65  EXT.   ICY SEA                           ANTI-DAY        65
    
    The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV
    as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
    wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.
    
    As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
    heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer
    still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.
    Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,
    but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a
    massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is
    engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the
    ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after
    course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we
    continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is
    looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an
    opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts
    out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and
    managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing
    thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark
    passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself
    teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull
    and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs
    curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow
    shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks
    and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM
    gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but
    his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far
    below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of
    grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks
    and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back
    and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the
    ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another
    boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as
    the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches
    at the wall.
    
    
66  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY            66
    
    SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The
    boom repeats. LIME is knocking on the other side. SAM
    leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the
    desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.
    
67  INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY             67
    SAM enters. LIME is standing, proudly holding out a sheet
    of paper.
    
                             LIME
               Computers are my forte.
    
                              SAM
                    (reading)
               Gillian Layton, age twenty three,
               eyes, blue, hair, black, weight, one
               hundred and twenty-one pounds,
               distinguishing marks, blemish on
               right shoulder, scar on left elbow
    
    He stops, having come to the end. He looks at the other
    side of the paper but there's nothing there.
    
    Is this all you got?
    
                             LIME
               It's a start isn't it.
                              SAM
                    (disbelieving)
               But I already knew this!
               
                             LIME
               Best to take it slowly where some
               women are concerned.
    
    SAM sits on LIME's chair and deftly punches the computer
    keys.
    
                             LIME
               Hey - that's my desk!
    
                              SAM
                    (working quickly)
               Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173.
               Truck driver! All enquiries,
               reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.
                    (switching off the machine
                    and getting up)
               That's what I wanted to know. Thank
               you very much.
    
    
68  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            68
    
    SAM heads off down corridor. WARREN & CO. appear.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you ...
                    (he continues to deal with
                    expediters in between
                    dealing with Sam)
               No, send it back for ... Are you
               settling down? ... I want this order
               rescinded ... There's a query on a
               personnel transporter you took out
               from the pool ... Tell them no, tell
               them yes, ... or was it a personnel
               carrier you took out from
               transportation ... Send that up to
               Security ... Some kind of eight-wheel-
               half-track, was it? ... Tell him I
               want to see him ... Send round the
               paperwork, Lowry ... Arrange a
               conference on that one ... Anyway,
               tidy it up, Lowry, there's a good
               chap - get a new suit. Did you want
               the lift?
    
    The cavalcade is passing the lifts. SAM backs away into
    the open lift. The cavalcade passes on out of sight. The
    lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop. She
    remains in the lift as SAM joins her.
    
    
69  INT.   THE LIFT                          69
    
    SAM presses the button for the 50th floor. The lift doors
    close on him and the CHARLADY. From somewhere far away
    there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances
    around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning
    vent in the ceiling.
    
    SAM glances enquiringly at the CHARLADY who merely smiles
    at him. Another scream is heard.
    
                              SAM
               What's that?
    
    The CHARLADY smiles again.
    
               Doesn't that disturb you?
    
    The CHARLADY fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
    out a pair of wax earplugs.
    
                           CHARLADY
               Beg your pardon?
    
    The lift arrives.
    
    
70  INT.   50TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             70
    
    The lift arrives. SAM steps out. The CHARLADY remains in
    the lift. The doors close. SAM heads down surgically clean
    white-tiled corridor.
    
    Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears
    to be electric meters, SAM comes to a door with 5001.
    Above the door a red light is glowing. SAM knocks. The red
    light goes out and a green light comes on. SAM enters.
    
    
71  INT.   ROOM 500l                         DAY             71
    
    Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
    the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-
    looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and
    typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who,
    busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently
    mouths the words ...
    
                            TYPIST
               It won't be long now.
                    (she carries on typing)
                    
    SAM nods, and stands quietly by her. He can hear tiny
    sounds coming through her headphones. He looks down at the
    piece of paper in the typewriter. He reacts a bit
    strangely, perhaps even winces. We see he close up of the
    words being struck crisply on paper.
    
                         ON TYPEWRITER
               AHHHH, Oh God ... No, don't ... UHH,
               please ... I ... STOP!! I can't stand
               ... AIIEEEE.
    
                            TYPIST
                    (quietly, still typing)
               Can I help you?
    
    She is looking at SAM helpfully, holding one of the
    earphones away from her ear. From this earphone we can
    just hear quietly ...
    
                           EARPHONE
               Oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...
               arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... Oh God,
               No ... No, stop, I don't know ...
    
                              SAM
               I'm looking for Officer 412/L.
    
    The TYPIST nods smiling. She puts back the earphone and
    carries on typing.
    
                            TYPIST
               I'm sure he won't be long now.
    
    She types a little more but suddenly stops.
    
                         I thought so!
    
    She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
    carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
    the different copies.
    
    Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,
    SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn
    left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits
    from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them,
    a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.
    
                            TYPIST
               You can go in now.
    
    
72  INT.   JACK'S OFFICE                     DAY            72
    
    SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open
    the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise
    from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the
    left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk
    with a large collection of executive toys and other
    tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
    rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall
    of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from
    entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently
    successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the
    wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval
    TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with
    old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?
    
    The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He
    continues vibrating his temples.
    
                              SAM
                    (a bit louder)
               Er, excuse me!
    
    Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As
    he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
    down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as
    it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He
    continues over to the TECHNICIAN.
    
                              SAM
                    (louder)
               Excuse me.
    
    He touches the TECHNICIAN on the shoulder, who jumps with
    a start. He spins around and turns out to be none other
    than JACK LINT. He is amazed to see SAM.
    
                              SAM
                    (surprised)
               Jack!!
    
                             JACK
                    (recovering slightly)
               SAM! What a surprise!
    
                              SAM
                    (even more surprised)
               Are you officer 412/L?
    
    JACK looks confused. He pauses, and then removes ear
    plugs.
    
                             JACK
                    (shaking Sam's hand)
               Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told
               me you were coming aboard -
               congratulations!
    
                              SAM
               Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
    
                             JACK
               For my sins. Are you settling in
               alright?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, thanks.
    
                             JACK
               Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped
               by. Unfortunately, I don't have any
               time right now I've got a queue of
               customers to deal with - er, why
               don't we have a drink tonight?
    
                              SAM
                     (diffidently)
               Ah ...
    
                             JACK
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I don't want to take up your time
               now, but I was hoping you could give
               me some information on somebody. It's
               a security level three matter and
               Information Retrieval records says to
               refer to you.
    
                             JACK
               OK. Come back this afternoon, about
               four o'clock. If you give me the
               number of the case, I'll have the
               dossier here waiting.
                    (he pulls card from his
                    pocket - pushes it towards
                    Sam)
               My tailor,... well worth the
               investment.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out sheets
                    from his pocket)
               I've got numbers all over these - I'm
               not sure which is the one you want.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking at the print-out
                    picture of Jill over Sam's
                    shoulder)
               Layton! Oh shit!
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             JACK
               You clever bastard! I might have
               guessed. You only moved in today and
               you're already hot on the bloody
               trail.
    
                              SAM
    Am I?
    
                             JACK
    Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other
    on this one. If you make a reputation with this case,
    it'll be at my expense.
    
                              SAM
               How do you mean?
    
                             JACK
               How much do you know?
    
                              SAM
               Not much.
    
                             JACK
               Enough though, eh?
    
                              SAM
                    (getting sucked into this
                    exchange)
               Not really, no.
    
    JACK goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full
    blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin.
    
                             JACK
               OK. OK. Let's not fence around ...
               This is the situation. Some idiot
               somewhere in the building, some
               insect, confused two of our clients,
               B58/732 and T47/215.
    
                              SAM
               B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
    
                             JACK
               Christ! You do know it all!
    
                              SAM
               No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning
               Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
    
                             JACK
               Well, your A. Buttle has been
               confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.
               I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should
               be shot for that. So B58/732 was
               pulled in by mistake.
    
                              SAM
               You got the wrong man.
    
                             JACK
                    (a little heated)
               I did not get the wrong man. I got
               the right man. The wrong man was
               delivered to me as the right man! I
               accepted him, on trust, as the right
               man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to
               the confusion, he died on us. Which,
               had he been the right man, he
               wouldn't have done.
    
                              SAM
               You killed him?
    
                             JACK
                    (annoyed)
               Sam, there are very rigid parameters
               laid down to avoid that event but
               Buttle's heart condition did not
               appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think
               I'm dismissing this business, Sam.
               I've lost a week's sleep over it
               already.
                               
                              SAM
               I'm sure you have
    
                             JACK
               There are some real bastards in this
               department who don't mind breaking a
               few eggs to make an omelette, but
               thank God there are the new boys like
               me who want to maintain decent
               civilized standards of terrorist
               eradication. We've got the upper hand
               for the moment, but they're waiting
               for us to slip up, and a little slip-
               up like this is just the chance
               they're looking for.
    
                              SAM
               So how ...?
    
                             JACK
               What I've got to do now is pick up
               Tuttle, interrogate him at the same
               voltage as Buttle, to the same meter
               reading to the last penny, and juggle
               the books in electrical banking.
    
                              SAM
               What has Tuttle done?
    
                             JACK
               We suspect him of freelance
               subversion.
    
                              SAM
                    (dumbly)
               He's a freelance subversive?
    
                             JACK
               He's a compulsive heating engineer. A
               maverick ex-Central Service repair
               man with a grudge against society.
               Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of
               the wood, I think. At least we will
               be when I get this Layton woman under
               arrest.
    
    JACK turns off taps and goes behind screen.
    
                              SAM
                    (agitated)
               What's she done?
    
                             JACK
               You didn't know as much about this
               business as you pretended to, did
               you?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... no.
    
                             JACK
               Very smart.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... but I would've found out
               anyway.
    
                             JACK
               Yes. I'm impressed.
    
                              SAM
                    (playing the game)
               Tell me about Layton.
    
                             JACK
               She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the
               Buttle arrest - and since then she's
               been making wild allegations,
               obviously trying to exploit the
               situation - she's working for
               somebody, and she's not working for
               us.
    
                              SAM
               A terrorist?
    
    JACK comes from behind the screen with a look confirming
    just what SAM fears, and hands him a suit.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... thanks.
    
    SAM begins to put the suit on.
    
                              SAM
                    (hesitantly)
               But surely, I mean, perhaps she just
               happened to live above the Buttles,
               and ...
    
                             JACK
                    (picking up photograph of
                    wife and kids from his
                    desk)
               Look after that suit, eh. Barbara
               chose it for me.
    
                              SAM
               Right. Er, you're not going to keep
               calling her Barbara, are you?
    
                             JACK
               Barbara's a perfectly good name,
               isn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (preferring to let his
                    drop)
               Look, about the Layton woman - maybe
               she's just trying to help the Buttle
               family.
    
                             JACK
               Why?
    
                              SAM
               Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
    
                             JACK
                    {baffled)
               I don't follow you.
    
                              SAM
               Out of kindness.
    
                             JACK
                    (utterly baffled)
               Kindness? What's the purpose behind
               this line of enquiry?
    
                              SAM
                    (deciding to abandon this
                    line of country)
               So what are you going to do about
               her?
    
                             JACK
               Get her out of circulation - I've put
               her on the detention list.
    
                              SAM
                    (thinking fast)
               You mean you're going to invite her
               in so that she can spill the beans
               inside the department?
    
                             JACK
                    (taken aback)
               Well, I ... Good point. What do you
               suggest?
    
                              SAM
               Let me try to get to her. I'll
               deactivate her.
    
                             JACK
               What does that mean? I don't want to
               be involved in anything unsavoury.
    
                              SAM
               Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
    
                             JACK
               Of course. We went to school
               together. You're my oldest friend.
    
                              SAM
               And you're mine.
    
                             JACK
               You're the only person I can trust.
    
                              SAM
               Then we'd better keep this business
               just between the two of us.
    
                             JACK
               Right! Just between as and the
               Security Forces.
    
                              SAM
               They weren't at school with us.
    
                             JACK
               But, I've already put her on the
               search and detain list.
    
                              SAM
               Take her off the list.
    
                             JACK
               There's no procedure for that until
               she's been arrested.
    
                              SAM
               Say it was a mistake.
    
                             JACK
               We don't make mistakes.
    
                              SAM
               Well, I'd better get out there and
               try to get to her before security
               does. Let me borrow her dossier for a
               while.
    
                             JACK
               Er ... alright. For Christ's sake
               don't lose it. Here, you'd better
               sign for it.
    
    JACK presents SAM with something to sign. He then gives
    him the dossier.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
    
                             JACK
               Do you know what you're doing.
    
                              SAM
                    (about to say no, then
                    pauses)
               Trust me.
    
                             JACK
                    (admiring Sam's new look)
               Sam ... we're proud to have you at
               Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas.
                    (he hands Sam another
                    executive package)
    
    
73  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            73
    
    SAM steps out of Room 5001, newly suited with old suit
    over arm. TWO GUARDS are guiding a BAGGEE down the
    corridor ahead of him. Suddenly, the BAGGEE breaks away
    from his GUARDS and begins to cannonball down the corridor
    directly at SAM. SAM is flattened against the wall as the
    BAGGEE rockets by.
    
    CUT to GUARDS strolling past SAM.
    CUT to BAGGEE running full tilt to the end of the
    corridor, smashing into the wall, bouncing back, getting
    up (now cross-ways in the corridor), bouncing off that
    wall, then the wall behind him, then ...
    
    
74  INT.   LIFT                              DAY            74
    
    Slightly unnerved, SAM gets in the lift, pushes the button
    for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing
    JILL's dossier. The lift descends. But unnoticed by SAM
    continued past his floor without stopping. It stops at the
    Lobby Mezzanine. SAM looks up and realizes he is on the
    wrong floor. Angrily he pushes the correct floor number
    but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice
    echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the
    direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing
    with the PORTER.
    
                             JILL
               But you've stamped this form before!
               Why won't you stamp it now?
    
                            PORTER
               You've just said yourself, Miss,
               we've already stamped it. Why should
               we stamp it twice?
    
    SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift
    doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes
    the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this
    point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross
    between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille
    doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall
    in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of
    dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the
    Ministry.)
    
    SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see
    SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of
    the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.
    SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
    to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL
    disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.
    
    
75  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            75
    
    The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to
    respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are
    waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them
    hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the
    buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of
    the lift and is able to read the sign - "LIFT OUT OF
    ORDER". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All
    the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off
    to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it
    he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but
    there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before
    he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.
    
                             VOICE
               Hey, you - get out of there.
    
    A GUARD approaches looking tough and mean.
    
                             GUARD
               What do you think you're doing ...
               that's the Deputy Minister's lift.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
    
                             GUARD
               Hold on, sonny ... let's see your
               I.D.
    
    SAM fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to
    the lobby before JILL leaves. He has forgotten he is
    wearing his new I.D. badge. The GUARD can't see it because
    JILL's dossier is covering it.
    
                              SAM
               Shit ... it's here somewhere. My
               name's Lowry, Sam Lowry - Expediting
               ... can't this wait?
    
                             GUARD
               No, sir ...
                    (getting out book of forms)
               I'm going to have to file a report on
               this. Now ... what date is it
               today?...
    
    SAM gives up trying to find his I.D. card.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               Sorry, it'll have to wait.
    
    He runs off - dropping suit - towards some stairs he has
    spotted.
    
                             GUARD
               Stop!! Come back!
    
    He starts to run after SAM. TWO OTHER GUARDS also give
    chase.
    
    
75a INT.   STAIRS                            DAY           75a
    
    SAM scrambles up the stairs. GUARDS in pursuit.
    
    
76  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            76
    
    The original GUARD rushes over to a guard desk and inserts
    key into cover of what is clearly an alarm button.
    
    
77  INT.   STAIRS                            DAY             77
    
    SAM still running.
    
    
78  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY             78
    
    JILL is still arguing with PORTER.
    
                             JILL
                    (sweetly)
               You're a stupid, fat arsed,
               obstructive, fascist moron aren't
               you?
    
                            PORTER
               If you say so.
    
                             JILL
               You think these are tits don't you?
    
                            PORTER
               Ah.
    
                             JILL
               I bet you'd like to touch them?
    
                            PORTER
               Oh.
    
                             JILL
               Well don't. You're looking at twenty
               pounds of high explosive! And if you
               don't stamp this form I'm going to
               blow the place up!
    
    JILL thumps the desk with her fist.
    
    
79  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY             79
    
    The GUARD throws the alarm switch.
    
    
80  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY            80
    
    Alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily
    armed GUARDS leap out, their guns trained on JILL as she
    appears to be the only person around.
    
                             GUARD
                    (shouting)
               DROP IT!!
    
    JILL has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully
    drops. She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the
    response to her hitting the desk. The GUARDS close in.
    
    SAM rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. He can't
    believe the sight that greets him. He responds
    instinctively,
    
                              SAM
               STOP! Let her go!
    
    He rushes over to the Porter's desk just as the GUARDS
    behind him come through the door. He doesn't have a clue
    what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of
    GUARDS they snap attention. Confused he looks around and
    then realizes his I.D. badge, is on his lapel and the
    GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him
    screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to
    attention. Everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant
    to make the next move. SAM breaks the silence.
    
                              SAM
               Well done ... uh ... excellent work
               ... quick thinking. I'll take charge
               of her now ...
    
    Realising he has JILL's dossier, he shows it to everyone -
    her print-out pictures are on the front page.
    It's a classified matter ... I'll include your fine
    handling of the situation in my report
    
    SAM is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive
    toy present - he hands it to the PORTER.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Jill)
               Come with me, please.
    
    He hustles her towards the door.
    
    
81  EXT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BUILDING    DAY             81
    
    SAM marches JILL out of the main door and down the front
    steps of the Information Retrieval building. As he
    struggles with her some of the papers in the dossier slip
    out unbeknownst to SAM and leave a trail of litter behind
    them.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you? Let go!
    
                              SAM
               Don't look back! Act naturally!
    
                             JILL
               How can I act naturally, when you've
               trying to break my arm?
    
    CUT to the POV of the Ministry of Information front door
    GUARDS. They are looking down the steps at the retreating
    backs of SAM and JILL who are jostling each other. The
    GUARDS see JILL elbow SAM in the ribs.
    
                              SAM
                    (wincing)
               Ow! That hurt!
    
                             JILL
               Good!
    
                       VOICE FROM BEHIND
               STOP! Come back here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh, God ... no!
    
    He turns around, knowing that the game is up. But instead
    of one of the GUARDS shouting - it's an OLD LADY angrily
    glaring at him and pointing to a "Keep your city tidy"
    sign above a litter bin.
    
                           OLD LADY
                    (screaming)
               Can't you read english? You
               illiterate foreign pig! You come here
               from your own filthy country and
               think you can mess our streets up!
               You should be fried alive, you dirty
               verminous ... etc. etc.
    
    SAM sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the
    pavement. He lets go of JILL for a moment to grab at the
    papers. The LADY continues screaming at him, her little
    Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his
    bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping SAM's new trousers.
    SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the
    dossier and following JILL who has disappeared round the
    corner. He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after
    JILL.
    
    CUTTING back to the TWO GUARDS, who have been observing
    all this bizarre activity, we see one of them reading one
    of the pieces of paper.
    
                          OTHER GUARD
               Hey, you shouldn't be reading that
               it's classified.
    
    
82  EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            DAY             82
    
    JILL is behind the steering wheel of her lorry which is
    just starting to move off. SAM frantically runs towards
    the lorry, leaps on the running board and pulls himself up
    into the cab.
    
    
83  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY            83
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing in)
               Well done, that's it ... Let's go!
               Vrmmm. Vrmmm.
    
    SAM looks up and down his side of the street anxiously
    before realizing that JILL has switched off the engine and
    is sitting glaring at him. They are stopped, right in
    front of the Ministry building.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               What are you doing? For Christ's
               sake! Get moving!
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
    Desperately SAM pulls roller blind down over window.
    
                              SAM
                    (hurriedly)
               Sam Lowry. Hello. This sounds insane,
               I know, but I've been dreaming about
               you. Even before I saw you you were
               in my dreams. Weird isn't it. I mean
               ... I don't know what it means ...
               but it might mean something ...
               mightn't it? I hope so. Anyway you're
               in danger and I think we should get
               out of here, now, quick! Come on!
    
    Still JILL does nothing. SAM pulls down roller blind over.
    window.
    
                              SAM
                    (desperate)
               Bloody hell! Do as I say!
    
                             JILL
                    (hard, icy cool)
               No.
    
                              SAM
                    (beginning to lose his
                    bottle)
               Please!
    
    JILL continues to sit, glaring.
    
    SAM delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of
    I.D. cards and papers, most of which fall onto the floor.
    He then remembers that the badge he's looking for is
    pinned to his jacket. He thrusts it forward at JILL.
    
                              SAM
                    (beside himself with panic)
               Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm
               Information Retrieval Officer -
                    (he checks the number
                    somewhere. On the badge?)
               DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for -
               your own good! Now start up and get
               moving before I hand you back to
               them!
                    (indicating M.I. building)
    
                             JILL
               Them?
    
                              SAM
               Us. Them. I don't know ... just get
               going.
    
    JILL starts up and moves off, very cool, in her own time.
    By now SAM has got the shakes.
    
                             JILL
                    (indicting the papers that
                    Sam has dropped)
               Don't litter my cab!
    
                              SAM
                    (picking them up)
               Oh, sorry.
    
    
84  EXT.   CITY FREEWAY                      DAY            84
    
    A high shot of the lorry, moving through the city among
    traffic.
    
    
85  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  DAY            85
    
    JILL is preoccupied with driving. She is smoking a
    cigarette. SAM occasionally glances at her.
    
                              SAM
               ... This is amazing ... for me ...
               being here with you. I mean, in my
               dreams you ...
    
                             JILL
               I don't want to hear about your
               fucking dreams!
    
                              SAM
               Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted
               at you.
    
                             JILL
                    (mainly to herself)
               Why are they all pigs at Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               I don't know.
                    (realizing that this
                    includes him)
               Hey, that's not a very nice thing to
               say.
    
    JILL blows smoke in SAM's direction.
    
                              SAM
                    (waving the smoke away)
               You know, smoking's bad for you.
    
                             JILL
               It's my fucking life.
    
                              SAM
                    (winding down the window)
               Yes, of course. Sorry.
    
                             JILL
                    (lighting up another
                    cigarette)
               I know you. I saw you through the
               floor, didn't I?
    
                              SAM
               Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't run away. I left the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Why?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't like it.
    
                              SAM
               Why not?
    
                             JILL
               It had a hole in the floor. Where are
               we going?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're
               taking me.
    
                             JILL
               It does doesn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly worried)
               Where are you taking me?
    
    
86  EXT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  86
    
    We PULL BACK and lift off to see that the beautiful
    countryside through which we've been travelling is in fact
    a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts
    of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray
    flavored cigarettes - you name it - These advertisements
    form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels.
    From a bird's eye POV we see that the land behind the
    hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc.
    
    
87  EXT.   POWER PLANT            DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)      87
    
    The power plant is an extensive, brutal, Dante's Inferno
    of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys,
    huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... It
    is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and
    forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. In the
    murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective
    clothing and hard hats.
    
    This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ...
    The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
    JILL jumps down from the cab. SAM stays inside, looking
    around. Something catches his eye.
    
    CUT to facade of house. Window boxes with flowers and
    shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide
    domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with
    protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his
    face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out
    of frame.
    
    In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and
    a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled
    with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto
    the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
    of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
    the power plant.
    
    
88  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY             88
    
    SAM watches JILL walk away from the lorry and enter the
    despatcher's hut. He looks around uneasily and then he
    start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
    compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He
    gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the
    seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had
    carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this
    cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the
    cab door.
    
                             JILL
               Don't act guilty. Act like me. I'm
               just getting on with my job. Or, are
               you just getting on with yours?
    
    JILL gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a
    forward looking position.
    
                              SAM
               What's going on here?
    
                             JILL
               What does it look like ... I'm
               collecting empties.
               
    The lorry stops and JILL gets out. From SAM'S P.O.V., the
    house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
    sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a
    package out from behind the seat. She glances
    surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel
    inside her jacket she walks away.
    
    
89  EXT.   LORRY                             LATE AFTERNOON 89
    
    SAM climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on
    JILL. He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot
    standard. The picture on it - though faded by pollution -
    is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by
    the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her
    way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the
    corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be
    exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious
    behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on
    the side of the building that illustrates, almost
    identically, the action we have just seen along with the
    warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL. EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE".
    
    CUT to the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry.
    
    
90  INT.   LORRY CAB                         LATE AFTERNOON 90
    
    JILL is starting up the lorry. SAM is glancing over her
    shoulder at the suspicious parcel which is tucked behind
    her. They move off. The last view of the power plant is of
    a group of MEN all in protective clothing and masks
    happily playing a game of volleyball.
    
    
91  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  LATER AFTERNOON91
    
                              SAM
               OK. What's in the parcel?
    
                             JILL
               What parcel?
    
    SAM nods knowingly in the direction of the parcel.
    JILL I don't know. Christmas present.
    SAM picks it up.
    
                              SAM
               It's heavy.
    
                             JILL
               A heavy Christmas present.
    
    He glances at her suspiciously.
    
                             JILL
               Open it if you don't trust me.
    
    SAM hesitates and puts the parcel down.
    
                              SAM
               I'd rather trust you.
    
    
    JILL gives him a quizzical look and smiles slightly, in
    spite of herself. She turns away so that he won't notice.
    
    
92  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY IN CITY TRAFFIC  DUSK           92
    
                             JILL
               What are you doing in Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               Looking for you.
    
                             JILL
               No, really.
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                             JILL
               I mean, it doesn't suit you.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at his jacket)
               Suit me?
    
                             JILL
               Don't you know the sort of thing that
               Information Retrieval does?
    
                              SAM
               What do you mean? Would you rather
               have terrorists?
    
                             JILL
               We've got both.
    
                              SAM
               Things would be worse without
               Information Retrieval.
    
                             JILL
               They couldn't be worse for the
               Buttles.
    
    SAM is at a loss.
    
                             JILL
               Why don't you say, no system is
               perfect.
    
                              SAM
               Well, no system is.
    
                             JILL
               Say, all wars have innocent victims.
    
                              SAM
               Well, all wars do -
    
                             JILL
               Who is this war against, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Well, terrorists of course.
    
                             JILL
               How many terrorists have you met?
               Actual terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's
               only my first day.
    
    JILL bursts out laughing. SAM joins in. They are both
    laughing hysterically as they approach the Central
    Supplies depot.
    
    
93  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK            93
    
    The impression is that the place could be an abandoned
    airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose
    contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all
    the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles
    of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily
    grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated
    houses) standing in the open others protected under simple
    areas of roofing. Each group of Assorted Supplies lies
    inside the squares of the grid of streets. The streets are
    eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each
    square is also lit by harsh localized lighting. The effect
    is a nightmarish gigantic Aladdin's cave of black shadows
    and garishly lit mountains of stuff.
    
    
94  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           94
    
    JILL's lorry starts down one of the "streets".
    
                             JILL
                    (as they pass a clock in
                    "C"s)
               Look at that - right on time.
    
                              SAM
               What? I thought you were free to come
               and go as you please.
    
                             JILL
               Well, almost ... unfortunately I do
               have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly surprised)
               Every day?
    
                              SAM
               Turn around!
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               They'll be there waiting.
    
                             JILL
               Who will?
    
                              SAM
               Security.
    
                             JILL
               You're joking.
    
                              SAM
               No. Please. They're going to arrest
               you.
    
                             JILL
               I thought you arrested me.
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
                    (he grabs for the emergency
                    brake)
    
                             JILL
                    (pushing his hand away)
               Cut it out, Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing at the steering
                    wheel)
               Will you please turn back.
    
                             JILL
                    (shoving him back)
               Get away!
    
                              SAM
                    (lunging for the steering
                    wheel)
               Turn!
    
                             JILL
                    (unable to control him)
               Stop it ... damn you!
    
    SAM throws the lorry into a gut-sucking skid.
    
    
95  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           95
    
    The lorry skids around a corner and roars down a side
    street of containers.
    
    
96  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK            96
    
    SAM and JILL are fighting for control of the lorry.
    
                             JILL
               You're mad! You're out of your mind!
    
    At that moment the air is split apart by the wail of
    sirens. SAM and JILL look back.
    
    
97  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           97
    
    From inside two strategically placed wooden containers
    stacked amongst the piles of containers marked
    "AUTOMOBILES" burst forth two Security vehicles. Wood
    flying, lights flashing, wheels smoking - they squeal away
    in pursuit.
    
    
98  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           98
    
                              SAM
               I was right! Step on it!
    
                             JILL
               Let go! We've got to stop!
    
                              SAM
               Now you're the one that's out of your
               mind.
    
                             JILL
               Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll
               kill us!
    
    They struggle for control of the lorry.
    
    
99  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           99
    
    The lorry rumbles down the street of containers lurching
    from side to side as the battle in the cab wages back and
    forth. Containers are smashed open and their contents
    spill out only to be further damaged as the pursuing
    Security vehicles crash through them. The lorry escapes
    from the streets of containers and cannons through the
    main gate and out on to the streets of the city.
    
    
100 INT.   LORRY CAB                         DUSK          100
    
    SAM and JILL are still struggling violently for control of
    the lorry. SAM is terribly inexpert as a driver but he
    behaves like someone possessed. Through the rear view
    mirrors he can see the Security vehicles catching up with
    them. He starts fumbling with he multiple gear levers.
    
                             JILL
               Don't touch those!
    
    
101 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREETS                  DUSK           101
    
    The lorry roars down a street of terraced houses and then
    screeches around a corner.
    
    
102 INT.   LORRY                             DUSK          102
    
    SAM pushes JILL's hand back and grabs for the lever that
    he thinks is overdrive. But rather than gaining speed
    there is a terrible lurch as the house and trailer
    disconnect from the cab.
    
    
103 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          103
    
    The house slides off the trailer which is skidding
    sideways and crunches to the ground just as the Security
    vehicles round the corner.
    
    
104 INT.   SECURITY VEHICLE                  DUSK          104
    
    From behind the DRIVER we can see that the house has
    settled across the roadway at right-angle to the other
    houses, making it appear to be a normal dead end street.
    So shocked is the DRIVER that he fails to stop in time and
    KABLOW!! the car smashes into the house.
    
    
105 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          105
    
    Hot on the heels of the 1st car, the 2nd vehicle skids and
    then smashes into the house which collapses and then
    explodes in flames.
    
    
106 INT.   JILL'S LORRY                      DUSK          106
    
    SAM sits paralysed with shock. The lorry has come to a
    halt. JILL is desperately trying to get him to move.
    
                             JILL
               Come on, let's go! Let's get out of
               here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh God! What have we done?
    
                             JILL
               We? Don't blame me!
    
                              SAM
               It wasn't supposed to happen like
               this.
    
                             JILL
                    (looking behind)
               Shit! The house is on fire!
    
                              SAM
               "And your children all gone."
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home,
               your house is on fire and your
               children all gone" ... Do you think
               anyone's hurt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
                    (tapping him on the
                    forehead)
               Come out, I know you're in there
    
    
107 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          107
    
    A Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the
    streets. We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and
    skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from
    JILL's lorry. Heavily armed SECURITY POLICE pour out and
    take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever
    other cover is available. Searchlights are played on the
    lorry. The OFFICER IN CHARGE appears with a loud-hailer.
    
                       OFFICER IN CHARGE
               Come out, we know you're in there!
               You cannot possibly escape. Throw
               your weapons from your vehicle and
               come out slowly with your hands on
               your heads. Obey my instructions and
               no harm will come to you. But if you
               force us to shoot we'll shoot to
               kill.
    
    During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle "roars"
    around a corner behind the SECURITY POLICE. He rides into
    a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes
    cover" behind it. He points his toy rifle at JILL's lorry
    and takes shot. In reaction to the noise made by the kid's
    rifle the OFFICER IN CHARGE dives for cover and the
    SECURITY TROOPS open fire and pepper JILL's lorry cab with
    holes. A few of the SECURITY TROOPS then rush forward and
    fling open the cab door. The cab is empty. The OFFICER IN
    CHARGE gets to his feet and looks about. His uniform is
    covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. He just
    misses seeing the back of the BOY as he disappears round
    the corner on his tricycle.
    
    
108 INT.   LINGERIE DEPARTMENT/SHOPPING CENTRE              108
    
    To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
    sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. As we
    slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of
    exotic occasions we come upon SAM and JILL pushing a
    shopping trolley. In the trolley is the "suspicious"
    parcel which JILL was given at the power plant.
    
                              SAM
               This is a hell of a time to buy a
               nightie.
    
                             JILL
               Are you still following me?
    
                              SAM
               Please, Jill ... I love you.
    
                             JILL
               Go away.
    
                              SAM
               There are plenty of other safe
               places. Why don't we go back to my
               flat?
    
                             JILL
               Leave me alone!
    
                              SAM
               You've got to trust me. It sounds
               silly but I know we were meant to
               meet.
    
                             JILL
               You mean you were meant to hijack my
               truck, make me crash it, and have
               every security man in town looking
               for me?
    
                              SAM
               I vas just trying to help. I decided
               to trust you. Maybe I was wrong.
               Whose side are you on really? Who are
               your friends? Who was the man who
               gave you the parcel? What's in it?
               It's the only thing you saved from
               the lorry .... It must he something
               very special.
    
                             JILL
               I saved you from the lorry and you're
               not very special.
    
                              SAM
               ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated)
               Oh ... Jesus!
    
    SAM grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start
    tearing it open.
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to open it!
    
                             JILL
                    (grabbing parcel and trying
                    to take it from him)
               No you're not!
    
    They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. SAM's
    suit gets slightly ripped. Their tug-of-war is interrupted
    by a voice off camera.
    
                             VOICE
               SAM!!
    
    SAM turns to see MRS TERRAIN and SHIRLEY a short distance
    away. MRS TERRAIN is heavily bandaged and sitting in a
    wheelchair which SHIRLEY is pushing.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               It's me and Shirley!
    
    From the TERRAINS' POV SAM looks as if he is wrestling
    with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full
    length mirror. The mirror or something obscures JILL. MRS
    TERRAIN and SHIRLEY exchange puzzled looks and proceed
    toward SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets
               go of the parcel and pushes JILL
               away. She moves off.
    
                              SAM
                    (after Jill for Mrs
                    Terrain's benefit)
               I think that'll hold it.
                    (to Shirley)
               Hello Shirley. Just helping someone
               tie up a Christmas present. How are
               you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               My complication had a complication,
               but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up
               and bouncing about like a young
               gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas
               present for your mother?
    
                              SAM
                    (Trying to keep an eye on
                    Jill who is disappearing
                    from sight)
               Er, yes ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Shirley and I come here regularly. I
               love romantic lingerie.
    
    She unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things
    with strategic holes in them.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (coyly)
               Picture me in these.
    
    At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
    corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw
    JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust
    covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop
    dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over
    the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees
    JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
    plaster dust. He rushes over to her.
    
                              SAM
                           (frantic)
               Are you alright?
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
                    (anxiety giving way to
                    anger)
               You don't deserve to be! You should
               be dead, or maimed like them .... How
               could you ...?
                    (indicating the wounded)
               What a bloody stupid thing ... I
               should. have made you open it in the
               lorry
    
    She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
    open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.
    Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.
    She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's
    chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with
    the severed limbs of a shop dummy.
    
                             JILL
               There's your bomb! Our annual bribes
               for official ass-holes like you!
    
    SAM sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. Liquor
    oozes from the broken bottle all over SAM's suit. He is at
    a loss for words.
    
    JILL's attention is attracted by moans coming from the
    badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS. She goes to help them.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Sam)
               Come on, make yourself useful, there
               are people hurt!
               
    JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable.
    SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his
    Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
    make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are
    wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is
    general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and
    begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED.
    ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is
    attending.
    
                             JILL
               Hey stop ... she's hurt!
    
    The GUARD gives JILL a thump in the side of the face with
    his gloved hand. SAM sees red.
    
                              SAM
               DON'T TOUCH HER!!
    
    The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed
    into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over
    the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted
    lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up
    with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It
    makes a passable club.
    
                             JILL
               SAM .... don't!!
    
    The TWO COMBATANTS square off ... looking for an opening
    ... a chink in the other's defences - at which point SAM
    is flattened from behind by a TROOPER's gun butt.
    
    
108a       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY108a
    
    SAM is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. He
    tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing
    descent. With a thud he hits the bottom. Stunned, bruised
    and battered he tries to get up. Standing over him are the
    GREY PRISONERS. They press forward.
    
                              SAM
                    (feebly)
               Where is she? Is she here?
    
    The GREY PRISONERS dissolve into what looks like several
    BAGGEES.
    
    
109 INT.   BLACK MARIA                       EVENING       109
    
    The BAGGEES hang from a track on the ceiling of the Black
    Maria. SAM is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket,
    with his badge prominently displayed. He is dazed and
    mumbling ... the only BAGGEE in the wagon apart from TWO
    GUARDS who have removed their helmets and are relaxing
    while travelling back to base.
    
                            GUARD A
                    (scratching his head)
               These helmets don't half make your
               scalp itch.
    
                            GUARD B
               Ooh, don't mention it.
                    (beginning to scratch his
                    head)
               And they make you sweat. Half the
               time I can't see where I'm going -
               there's a great Niagara of
               perspiration coming down.
    
                            GUARD A
               I'm lucky, I've got thick eyebrows.
               That keeps it up and channels it out
               to my ears.
    
    SAM stirs and groans
    
                            GUARD B
               Who's he?
    
                            GUARD A
               Someone from Information Retrieval
               they're always hanging about in
               lingerie.
    
    SAM is coming to his senses. He takes in the situation,
    sees all the BAGGEES and staggers to his knees.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill! Are you there?!
    
    He begins rummaging through the BAGGEES. ONE of which is
    dressed as FATHER CHRISTMAS. SAM opens the "face vent" of
    the BAGGEE'S' hoods. A pair of strange eyes look out.
    
                            GUARD A
               Excuse me, sir - that's government
               property.
    
                              SAM
               Is here a girl here? Tall, fair hair,
               blue eyes?
    
                            GUARD A
               Dunno sir. They check all that at the
               depot.
    
    SAM continues fumbling about the BAGGEES.
    
                            GUARD 3
                      (pulling Sam back)
               We can't allow you to do that sir,
               it's more than our job's worth.
    
                              SAM
                    (shaking Guard off)
               I've got to find her! Jill! Jill!
    
                            GUARD A
               You can always fill in an application
               form, if you're a relative, sir.
               Please stop, sir.
    
    SAM takes no notice.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill!
    
    GUARD A hits SAM, knocking him out again.
    
                            GUARD A
               Sorry about that sir. Regulations.
               We'll have you safely back in your
               office in no time.

112 INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      EVENING       112
    
    SAM recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his
    desk in his office. He is bruised and battered and has a
    black eye. His suit is torn and bloody. MR WARREN is
    gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture.
    Behind WARREN, crowding the doorway, are the PEOPLE who
    circulate around him and are the cast of the WARREN high
    energy circus. LIME is with them.
    
                            WARREN
               This is a black eye for the
               department, Lowry! ... And I don't
               care how you behaved when you were at
               Records! Information Retrieval is an
               executive branch! We're proud of our
               reputation and we protect it!
    
    One of his ACCOLYTES thrusts a paper into his hand - he
    glances at it.
    
               Damn it, Lowry, that convoy of troop
               carriers is still not accounted for
               ... I thought I told you to deal with
               it.
    
    He slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with
    other forms.
    
               And what the hell is this mess? An
               empty desk is an efficient desk.
    
    He has picked up some of the forms.
    
               Good God! ... queries from Security,
               searches from Central Banking about a
               cheque, clarification notices from
               Accounting concerning unreturned
               receipts, another demand from the
               Motor Pool.
    
                              SAM
               Mr Warren ... I have to find out
               about ...
                               
                            WARREN
               Shut up! I don't know what's going on
               here, Lowry, but don't think you can
               intimidate us with your friends and
               relatives in high places! Now shape
               up!
    
    He dumps the papers and folders onto SAM's desk and storms
    off with his ENTOURAGE, leaving a gleeful LIME in the
    doorway.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Lime as he starts
                    to slip away)
               Lime, I need to use your computer
    
                             LIME
               Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.
                    (he indicates Sam's
                    smothered desk)
               You seem to have quite a lot to do
               yourself.
                    (he disappears into his
                    office)

    SAM rushes out of his office after LIME. But, LIME has
    locked his door. SAM bangs on the door.
    
                              SAM
               Shit!
    
    
112b       INT.                              SAM'S OFFICE   DAY112b
    
    SAM storms back into his office. Reaching a peak of
    frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the
    pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. Within
    seconds it returns. SAM sends it off a second time. It
    doesn't return a second time, periodically something
    passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's
    pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up.
    At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep
    through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it.
    There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM
    smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and
    then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM's
    office door. It shakes the whole building. SAM goes to his
    door and opens it.
    
    
113 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    CONTINUATION  113
    
    Every door in the corridor has been opened by the
    occupants of the room. All the occupants stick their heads
    into the corridor, all gazing with SAM at the variously
    coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the
    whole length of the corridor ceiling, from which protrudes
    the intestines of the pneumatic system.
    
    
114 INT.   JACK'S OFFICE CORRIDOR & INFORMATION         EVENING114
           RETRIEVAL CORRIDORS
    
    It is the end of the working day. JACK is leaving for
    home. He is putting on his executive-styled bullet-proof
    vest and packing his "Secret Connection" briefcase. As the
    scene progresses SAM and JACK proceed out of the door and
    down he corridor, passing other I.R. OFFICIALS. SAM is
    dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to
    JACK to is trying to distance himself from him.
    
                              SAM
               Come off it, Jack! Of course you can
               check to see if she's been arrested.
    
                             JACK
               I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole
               case has become much more complicated
               since last we talked.
    
                              SAM
                    (exasperated)
               She's innocent, Jack --- she's done
               nothing wrong.
    
                             JACK
               Tell that to the wives of the
               Security men she blew up this
               afternoon. Listen, we've also had a
               report just in from Central Services
               that Tuttle has wrecked an entire
               flat and sabotaged adjacent Central
               Services systems - as a matter of
               fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes
               open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
    
                              SAM
                    (catching up with Jack)
               You don't really think Tuttle and the
               girl are in league?
    
                             JACK
               I do. Goodbye.
                    (steps into lift)
    
    
115 INT.   LIFT                              EVENING       115
    
                              SAM
               It could all be coincidental.
    
                             JACK
               There are no coincidences, Sam.
               Everything's connected, all along the
               line. Cause and effect. That's the
               beauty of it. Our job is to trace the
               connections and reveal them.
                    (whispers)
               This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion
               was obviously planned from the
               inside. Bye bye.
    
    
116 INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         EVENING        116
    
    JACK and SAM have just emerged from the lift. The lift
    doors close. SAM agitatedly speaks.
    
                              SAM
               Jack, she's innocent!
    
                             JACK
               Sam - we've always been close,
               haven't we?
    
                              SAM
                    (eagerly)
               Yes we have, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               Well, could you stay away from me
               until this thing blows over.
    
    
117 EXT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       NIGHT    117
                       BUILDING
    
    SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The
    lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street
    lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious
    about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to
    retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry
    front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck
    was parked.
    
    
117a       EXT.                              JUST AROUND THE
CORNER     NIGHT                             117a
    
    SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first
    parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is
    a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and
    beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the
    pavement unsure his next move. The street light is
    reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the
    reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue
    cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street
    light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru
    the inner wall of the great stone ship.
    
    
117b       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY117b
    
                    DREAM GIRL'S VOICE
               I'm here Sam. Don't give up.
    
    SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the
    crack shafts across the space in which they find
    themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There
    in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful,
    shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone
    cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards
    them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a
    great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a
    black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round
    he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the
    floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI
    WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.
    The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he
    raises his spear in front of himself in an almost
    religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.
    Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round
    just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic
    WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM
    parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then
    strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has
    vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears
    something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who
    is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.
    Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.
    He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the
    ground.
    
    Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes
    at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM
    spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM
    rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next
    to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again
    and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he
    can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with
    his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him
    to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the
    big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground
    before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the
    wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the
    situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.
    The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages
    to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and
    opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries
    to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds
    in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes
    from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The
    wounds continue to bleed fire.
    
    SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen
    WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire
    rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing
    that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's
    his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire
    begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.
    SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell
    tolls.
    
    
118 EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            NIGHT         118
    
    SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is
    staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance.
    SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's
    got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway
    but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,
    is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses
    direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice
    comes from behind him.
    
                             JILL
               You're late.
    
    SAM spins around. Stepping out from the shadows is JILL -
    cigarette in her mouth.
    
                              SAM
                    (stunned)
               Jill! What are you do ... I mean ...
               how did you ... Are you alright?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
               What happened to you after ...
    
                             JILL
               Your face ... are you hurt?
    
                              SAM
               No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick
               about you ... I thought ...
    
    A patrol car approaches. Quickly SAM grabs JILL and goes
    into a kiss to explain their presence. The car hesitates
    for a moment and drives on.
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               They're gone.
    
                              SAM
                    (through kiss)
               Are you sure?
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               Yes.
    
    They resume passionate kiss. After a moment
    
                              SAM
                    (urgently)
               C'mon, we've got to get you off the
               streets.
    
    They head off clutching one another.
    
    
119 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT          119
    
    The Elysian Fields train arrives clattering. SAM and JILL
    are the only passengers to emerge. They can't keep their
    hands off one another. This is young love at its freshest
    and most exciting. SAM looks up and down the platform
    cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train
    clatters off again into the darkness. SAM and JILL
    approach SAM's front door. He puts a key in the door and
    tries to open the door but has some difficulty. Something
    creaks. He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens
    and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head..
    
    
120 INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT         120
    
    SAM enters, followed by JILL. His breath immediately
    starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam. The
    flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then
    deep frozen. Icicles are hanging down from everywhere. The
    flat looks like a scrap dump. Every wall has spilled out
    its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of
    the available space and making progress through the flat
    difficult. Half a dozen MEN are at work. They are
    impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing
    and look more like spacemen. Their voices however belong
    to SPOOR and DOWSER.
    
                              SAM
               For God's sake, what's happened?
    
                             SPOOR
               Thermostat's gone. And then some.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... And then some.
    
                              SAM
               What have you done to my flat?
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here, please.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... ere please.
    
    SPOOR offers a clipboard and pencil. He bangs the
    clipboard against the furniture to knock the ice off it.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
               It's a 27B/6 of course.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...B/6 of course.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Dowser)
               Do you repeat everying?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (nods)
               ... Everything.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (indicating the mess)
               This is what you get when you have
               cowboys round yer ducts.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... yer ducts.
    
                             SPOOR
               I think you've got your T41 crystal
               inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin-
               threaded-solenoid-control. It's
               either that or a new washer.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... new washer.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign the form so we can get to it.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... get to it.
    
    SAM grabs the clipboard and smashes it over SPOOR's head.
    The board is so cold that it snaps in two. The paper on it
    also snaps in two.
    
    
121 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT         121
    
    SAM pulls JILL out into the corridor.
    
                             JILL
               Don't you like parties?
    
                              SAM
               C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
    
    As SAM and JILL begin to move down the corridor they see a
    cigarette glow brightly in a dark recess.
    
                             JILL
                    (seeing cigarette light)
               TOO LATE!
    
    They ere about to run when TUTTLE steps out of the
    shadows.
    
                            TUTTLE
               I'll fix the damage when they've
               gone. I'll be ready for you tomorrow.
    
    
122 INT.   MOTHER'S CORRIDOR                 NIGHT         122
    
    A venerable PORTER carrying a single key on a large ring
    is preceding SAM and JILL along the corridor which we have
    seen before. The PORTER's name is MATTHEWS.
    
                              SAM
               My mother said it would be all right.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               She didn't say anything about it to
               me.
    
                              SAM
               Well, she's my mother, not yours.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               I won't be held responsible.
    
                              SAM
               How long will she he away?
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (darkly)
               There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's
               clinic who never come back at all.
    
    MATTHEWS unlocks MOTHER's door.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (to Jill)
               You're not a professional, are you?
    
                             JILL
               No, amateur.
    
                              SAM
                    (firmly)
               Thank you, Matthews.
    
    With which he ushers JILL through the door and closes the
    door in MATTHEWS' face.
    
    
123 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          123
    
                              SAM
               Make yourself at home. Don't answer
               the phone or open he door to anyone.
               I won't be long.
    
                             JILL
               Where are you going?
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to pull some strings. It's
               our only hope.
    
                             JILL
               Don't do anything silly.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.
    
                             JILL
               Take care.
    
    SAM goes.
    
    
124 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOYER       NIGHT          124
    
    SAM arrives at the Ministry of Information Retrieval
    reception It's late. GROUPS OF CLEANERS are operating
    cleaning machinery. SAM approaches the DESK PORTER who is
    playing with the executive toy SAM gave him.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me
               through to Mr Helpmann's office?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to
               go through the proper channels.
    
                              SAM
               And you can't tell me what the proper
               channels are, because that's
               classified information?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm glad to see the Ministry's
               continuing its tradition of
               recruiting the brightest and best,
               sir.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you, Dawson.
    
    SAM crosses the foyer, checks to see that Dawson is no
    longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive
    toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment,
    disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched LIME who hobbles
    across the lobby without seeing SAM, who slips down the
    stairs which he knows lead to Helpmann's private lift.
    
    
125 INT.   BASEMENT                          NIGHT         125
    
    SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding
    a GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close
    harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction.
    They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.
    
                         CHOIR MASTER
                    (stopping them)
               No, no, no, Arthur, you're going flat
               on that G. It's your breathing. Take
               a breath on the end. of the previous
               line, after Noel. Right, one, two,
               three.
    
    The CHOIR begins singing again. SAM reaches the lift and
    looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall.
    CLOSE UP of SAM's face concentrating. He hears, we hear, a
    reprise of MR HELPMANN talking to SAM in MOTHER's
    bathroom.
    
                        HELPMANN (V/O)
               Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
               but we were close friends, and I keep
               his name alive at the office every
               day. It's as though he's there
               speaking to me. "'ere I am, J.H."
    
    SAM is already typing the letters EREIAMJH into the
    keyboard. The lift judders and star s to ascend.
    
    
126 INT.   MR HELPMANN'S OFFICE              NIGHT         126
    
    SAM steps out of lift into an ante-room. No-one is there.
    Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the
    office. No reply. He slowly opens door.
    
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?
    
    The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he
    wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's
    desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
    an elaborate computer console in a side room. It
    occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large
    bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make
    sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the
    machine lights up.
    
    He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter
    machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He
    looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the
    message coming through: TOTAL - TOTAL -TOTAL - CAR 15
    REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE
    TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE.
    This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls
    silent.
    
    SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns
    to leave.
    The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and
    goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP
    shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF
    DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL
    CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for
    two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for
    a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches
    on the machine. He has he answer.
    
    
127 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          127
    
    SAM enters the flat. JILL is nowhere to be seen. The
    lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door
    beams a shaft of bright light. Music pours forth ... it is
    "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
                    (cautiously)
               Jill?
    
    Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through.
    There is JILL but, transformed. She is wearing one of
    SAM's MOTHER's wigs which billows in the air blown by a
    fan. She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed
    from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She
    looks like the DREAM GIRL. SAM stands open-mouthed. JILL
    notices him and smiles.
    
                             JILL
               What do you think? ... is it me?
    
                              SAM
                    (still stunned)
               You don't exist any more. I've killed
               you. Jill Layton is dead.
    
    He holds out a print-out. She reads it and slowly looks
    up.
    
                             JILL
               Care for a bit of necrophilia?
    
    They rush together.
    
    
128 INT.   STONE SHIP                        ANTI-DAY      128
    
    The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing
    about a beautiful blue sky. They course this way and that.
    Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a
    mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns.
    The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as
    SAM sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light.
    He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.
    far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with
    happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his
    sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
    the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been
    lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty
    swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as
    cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is
    disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
    topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes
    into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all
    directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains
    fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a
    beautiful blue sky. They look up to the sun. SAM is
    exultant.
    
    
129 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  DAWN          129
    
    Pull back from the sun through a window. The light falls
    on SAM's smiling sleeping face. Showly he wakes. He little
    by little remembers where he is and reaches over for JILL.
    She isn't there. Sam panics.
    
                             JILL
               Merry Xmas.
    
    She is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him. She
    crawls over to him - they start to embrace.
    
                              SAM
               Everything is going to be all right.
    
    But crash !!! it's a raid! Like a giant drill a whirling
    cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of
    Mother's bedroom, and we now see what made the neat hole
    in the BUTTLE ceiling ... CUTS show doors being burst open
    by SECURITY TROOPS. JILL and SAM are frozen in panic.
    SECURITY TROOPS are sliding down a fireman's pole" from
    the hole in the ceiling.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts)
               She's dead. Check the list!
    
    But it is SAM they have come for. He is being dragged out
    of the bed.
    
                            GUARDS
                    (as they struggle with him)
               You Turncoat Bastard! JUDAS!!
               TRAITOR!!
    
    A canvas bag is plunged over his head. All goes black.
    
                              SAM
                    (muffled)
               JILL!!!
    
    A shot rings out. JILL screams. It echoes through the
    blackness.
    
    
130 INT.   PROCESSING AREA                                 130
    
    In absolute inky darkness, SAM and the CAMERA move through
    space and time marked only by voices and sounds
    encountered on the way. This sound-sequence fades in and
    out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer
    than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence. We
    hear:
    
    Footsteps of SAM and GUARDS.
    
    Distant howl of pain.
    
    Muzak.
    
    Iron gate.
    
    Footsteps again.
    
    Lift doors opening and closing.
    
    Muzak.
    
    Typing pool.
    
                         FEMALE VOICE
               a wonderful gift, I changed it at the
               chemist for some antibiotics and
               bathroom scales and there's enough
               left on the voucher for a
               tonsilectomy if I want to treat
               myself ...
    
    Office door opens and closes.

               Christmas Parcel for you, sir ...
               sign here please ...
    
    What looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness
    opens. It is the eyeslit on the front of SAM's bag being
    opened by a SECURITY GUARD.
    
    The SECURITY GUARD peers in for a moment and then steps
    back to reveal two SMART OFFICIALS sitting at a desk. They
    are looking up at SAM/us.
    
                          OFFICIAL A

                          OFFICIAL A
               Right. Next!
    
    The SECURITY GUARD appears briefly and zips up the hood
    again plunging us back into darkness. We get more muffled
    shouts, heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere.
    
    Another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap on SAM's hood. We
    see another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                              SAM
                    (more hysterical)
               Where's Jill? What's happened to

               93/HKS/608, you've got quite a list
               of misdemeanours here, haven't you?
               All this is going to take time and
               money, and I'm afraid, according to
               your bank statement and credit rating
               here, you're likely to be in deep
               financial trouble by the end of it.

               which'll bring the costs down to
               within your reach, or you can borrow

               qualify for his scheme.

               All you have to do is to agree to

               I'm not guilty! Not guilty you stupid
               bastar...
    
    THE GUARD closes the flap. Once again darkness and
    confusion. until another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap
    again to reveal another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                          OFFICIAL E
                    (examining forms)
               Now, since you've elected to plead
               not guilty on all these charges,
               you'd be well advised to take some
               sort of insurance cover. Preferably
               comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,
               something more specific - say,
               against electrical charges over
               f70.00. And for food and
               accommodation costs of say, £800.00.
               Detention can be a very expensive
               business.
    
                          OFFICIAL F
               Now, before we bore you with the
               small print perhaps you'd like to
               tell us whether you'd like to sign
               this insurance acceptance form or
               not. Think carefully before you
               decide. Thinking ahead in financial
               matters is always the wise course.
    
    The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - NEW
    OFFICIALS are revealed. This process repeats again and
    again - getting faster and faster. The OFFICIALS' faces
    seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a
    growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the
    room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the
    OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press
    forward unseen by the OFFICIALS. Soon they fill the view
    through the flap.

131 INT.   STONE SHIP                        TIMELESS      131
    
    CUT to SAM struggling with the FORCES OF DARKNESS. He is
    overwhelmed by the black hordes. They fill the screen. SAM
    disappears under their onslaught. A pause. Then SAM is
    raised, spread-eagled, above the black sea of the FORCES.
    Strong hands hold him. The maniacal laughter starts up.
    SAM is turned in its direction.
    
    CUT to a shot over the top of the mass of robed FIGURES.
    Rising from the ruins of the stone columns, the black
    cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera. We can see
    the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom
    of Knowledge in the background.
    
    SAM looks terrified. As the thing hovers above SAM in all
    its huge twisting awfulness, it slowly begine to unfold
    like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion.
    
    SAM freezes as the interior becomes invisible. There in
    the billowing blackness is the GIRL. She is beckoning.
    
                             GIRL
               Sam.
    
    But the VOICE is no longer the mysterious feminine voice
    of before - it is the voice of the maniacal laughter.
    
    SAM struggles with the restraining hands. He twists and
    turns, but to no avail. From the darkness above him
    descends the JOLLY GENT looking just like MR HELPMANN) on
    his window washer's platform. However he is now dressed as
    Father Christmas.
    
                             GENT
               Sam, what are we going to do with
               you?
    
                             GIRL
               Ha ha ha ha ha.
    
    
132 INT.   CELL                              DAY/NIGHT     132
    
    The filing cabinets of the Storeroom of Knowledge dissolve
    squares of padding that form the walls of a cell. The
    laughter echoes round the cell. SAM sees that MR HELPMANN,
    in his wheelchair is watching him. He is dressed as Father
    Christmas. They are alone in the cell. SAM scrunches up
    into the corner.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Sam, what are we going to do with
               you? Can you hear me, Sam?
    
                              SAM
                    (in a hoarse urgent
                    whisper)
               Where's Jill? What have you done to
               her? Where is she?!
    
                           HELPMANN
               Gillian Layton?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, you've got to get me out of
               here. I've got to find her.
    
                           HELPMANN
               I understand, Sam, I know exactly how
               you feel. So I brought you a bottle
               of barley water.
               
    HELPMANN holds up a bottle of barley water.
    
                              SAM
                    (desperately)
               Help me!
    
                           HELPMANN
               I assure you, Sam, I'm doing
               everything within my power. But the
               rules of the game are laid down, and
               we all have to play by them - even
               me.
    
                              SAM
               This is all a mistake! Don't you
               understand?!
    
                           HELPMANN
               Yes, well, from the Department's
               point of view you're certainly a bit
               of an own goal, but ...
    
                              SAM
               I'm not a terrorist! You must know
               that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of
               here!
    
                           HELPMANN
               Sam, if you've been going out there
               and playing a straight bat, all the
               way down the line, you've got
               absolutely nothing to worry about.
    
                              SAM
               Please, I've got to find Jill.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Sam, I think I ought to tell you ...
               I'm afraid she's upped stumps and
               retired to the pavilion.
    
                       SAM looks blank.
    
               Thrown in the towel.
    
                              SAM
                    (takes a moment to work
                    this out)
               Dead?
    
    HELPMANN nods.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it
               seems she was killed resisting
               arrest.
    
                              SAM
                    (relieved)
               No, no ... I did that...
    
    HELPMANN looks surprised. SAM shuts up.
    
                           HELPMANN
               The odd thing is it appears to have
               happened twice ... a bit of a
               disputed call, I'm afraid.
    
    SAM has gone catatonic.
    
                           HELPMANN
                    (starting to go)
               So, there you are. All I can say is,
               don't fall at the last fence. The
               finishing post's in sight. See you in
               the paddock. Good luck. Keep your eye
               on the ball. Got to go .... Can't
               keep the orphans waiting.
    
    HELPMANN goes. A GUARD helps him out and then returns with
    ANOTHER to help put the restraining bag over SAM.
    
                             GUARD
               Don't fight it, son .... confess
               quickly ... Before they get into the
               expensive procedures. If you hold out
               too long you could jeopardise your
               credit rating.
    
    The bag blacks everything out.
    
    
133 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM                      133
    
    The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an
    Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back
    frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an
    unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of
    sight.
    
    The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange
    light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total
    disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately
    trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain
    tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.
    Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at
    hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions
    near the distant door they hand over documents to the
    white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.
    
                             GUARD
               11/AFT/607, sir.
    
    They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains
    after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then
    proceed to the door and take up positions on either side
    of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see
    he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.
    A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching
    him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the
    I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.
    After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the
    impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the
    GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep
    breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more
    briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and
    fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is
    covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he
    blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto
    the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?
    
    The I.R. OFFICER reacts to this as if he's been hit in the
    solar plexus, and he tries to disguise it by simulating a
    coughing fit. He then picks up a nasty looking implement
    and advances on SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?... Jack?
    
                             JACK
                    (hysterically from behind
                    mask)
               Shut up!
    
                              SAM
               Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
    
                             JACK
               Bastard!!!
    
                              SAM
               This is all a mistake. Jack, please
               take that mask off.
    
    JACK is very close to SAM, he is shaking. He lifts up his
    mask to reveal sweaty face, contorted with fear and anger.
    
                             JACK
               You stupid bastard!
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JACK
               How could you do this to me?
    
                              SAM
               Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
    
                             JACK
               How do you think I feel? You shit!
    
                              SAM
               Jack ...
    
                             JACK
                    (pulling down mask)
               Shut up! This is a professional
               relationship!
    
    JACK comes at SAM with the horrifying implement.
    
                              SAM
               JACK!! ... You can't ... No, don't!
    
    SAM's eyes widen in terror. From his POV we look up at
    JACK approaching. The ceiling above and behind JACK is
    suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole
    Machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's
    pole", the commando-like figure of MR TUTTLE gun in hand,
    leaps through the hole.
    TUTTLE is immediately followed by similar looking MEN with
    balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient
    guns. JACK is cut down. So are the TWO GUARDS who have
    opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into
    the room.
    
    TUTTLE raps out into a walkie-talkie
    
                            TUTTLE
               Detonate!
    
    From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion
    which rocks the room. TUTTLE is already unstrapping SAM.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Let's go!
    
    
134 INT.   CORRIDORS                         NIGHT         134
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, with SAM in the middle, fighting their
    way in the terrific battle with GUARDS, until they get to
    a door leading to the stairs.
    
    
135 INT.   ENDLESS STAIRWAYS                 NIGHT         135
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, their members thinning, and SAM, fighting
    down flight after flight of stairs with lots of neat-oh
    violence and blood and, gunshots and ... falling and
    bleeding and -
    
    
136 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY       NIGHT          136
    
    CUT to the RESCUERS fighting their way to the entrance.
    Another group of RESCUERS at the door are providing cover
    fire The PORTER sits behind his desk watching the battle
    on his bank of monitors.
    
                           2ND GROUP
    
               Quick! We've only got thirty seconds
               to get clear!
    
    TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey
    detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out
    through the door into the large empty forecourt.
    
    
137 EXT.   FORECOURT                         NIGHT          137
    
    The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.
    Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are
    totally exposed.
    
    They are cut down left and right.
    Desperately they battle their way across the open space.
    Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE
    towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last
    RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover.
    KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And
    another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated.
    SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits.
    Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a
    final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser
    of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and
    visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR
    HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.
    
    Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
    its load skywards. The night sky is full of white
    rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the
    city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He
    shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM
    and SAM runs.
    
    
138 EXT.   CITY PASSAGES                     NIGHT         138
    
    SAM runs madly through paper-littered passages
    
    
139 EXT.   SHOPPING                          PRECINCT     NIGHT139
    
    Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly
    lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of
    he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds
    casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business
    paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.
    Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way
    towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking
    against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds
    across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his
    foot. He tries shaking it off.
    
    It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the
    piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other
    leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the
    flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm.
    Still more paper blows against him. He is having
    difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he
    tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.
    He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe
    what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,
    apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from
    ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -
    and watches it career down the steps of the shopping
    precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon
    of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about
    on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from
    his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.
    The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind
    carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.
    But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few
    pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there
    with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he
    is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has
    stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS
    shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and
    dashes off.
    
    
140 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT         140
    
    The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM
    goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is
    empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind
    blows the curtains.
    
    
141 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  NIGHT         141
    
    The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling).
    SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes
    forwards.
    
    
142 INT. MOTHER'S FRONT DOOR NIGHT 142
    
    But it's MATTHEWS the porter who is at the door watching
    SAM running towards him.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (piously)
               A sad loss. Your mother was with her
               at the end. The doctor said there was
               no pain.
    
    SAM grabs MATTHEWS round the neck and shakes him.
    
                              SAM
               Where is she?
    
    
143 EXT    A CORNER                          NIGHT         143
    
    SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in
    a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There
    opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance
    to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from
    an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops
    and through the door.
    
    
144 INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT 144
    
    CUT to SAM slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and
    suddenly being confronted by SPIRO the Maitre D.
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It's so good you
               could make it. Right this way.
    
    SAM, dumbfounded, follows.
    
    CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern
    chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted
    up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit
    theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some
    sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands
    in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in
    stepped seats on three sides of the room.
    
    The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped
    the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large,
    rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking
    not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS
    JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.
    
    
    To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her
    hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the
    VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it,
    etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in
    the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (stopping and looking back
                    at Sam)
               Mrs Lowry? Mrs Lowry is ...
    
    In the background the VICAR begins speaking, and we hear
    his voice throughout the following action. CUT TO SAM'S
    POV ....
    
                     VICAR (in background)
               At these times of giving and
               receiving let's remember the greatest
               gift of all: not a gift to be
               spurned, not a gift to be opened and
               carelessly set on one side, not a
               gift to be taken back and changed,
               but the gift of eternal life. Mrs
               Terrain has just received that most
               wonderful of all gifts. She came to
               us physically new, she goes hence
               from us not so physically new. But
               the spirit never grows old. And in
               the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs
               Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy
               forever.
    
    ..... (CUT to SAM's POV) ... past SPIRO to a section in
    the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the
    VICAR where a WOMAN (her back to SAM) is surrounded by a
    buzzing flock of very handsome and well-dressed YOUNG MEN.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to take in scene)
               what? ... Oh ...
                    (starts to follow Spiro)
    
                             SPIRO
                    (coming up to back of
                    woman)
               Madam ...
    CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It
    is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years
    younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam!!!
                    (uncertainty in her
                    expression)
    
                              SAM
                    (staring dumbly, not
                    knowing what to say)
               Mother? ... What ... what's ...
               you've got to help me ...
    
                            MOTHER
                    (embarrassed, unsure)
               Not now ... please
    
                         YOUNG GALLANT
                    (belligerently)
               Ida, is this fellow bothering you?
                    (getting up)
               I'll -
    
    But before we can find out what he'll:
    
                             SFX:
               TERRIFIC CRASH.
    
    CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come
    crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The
    TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads
    for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes
    against the coffin which topples over spilling its
    contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his
    mouth and dashes through the door.
    
    
145 EXT.   MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES           NIGHT          145
    
    CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,
    hurting himself, getting up running.
    He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path
    seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.
    The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes
    deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top
    shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing
    FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The
    maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and
    right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.
    Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there
    is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead
    end.
    At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from
    the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair
    dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through
    this pile.
    
    
    Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He
    scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,
    TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.
    He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He
    actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to
    face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand
    touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The
    knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through
    it.
    
    
146 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT         146
    
    SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of
    furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
    frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is
    no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it
    shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit
    but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
    uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.
    He looks around but there is only one window and it is
    shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
    
    SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.
    
    
147 EXT.   CITY                              NIGHT         147
    
    JILL's truck, with the house on its back, is driving
    dangerously through he streets. It lurches round the
    corner.
    
    
148 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT          148
    
    - The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up,
    and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the
    shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,
    in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and
    finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He
    sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing
    JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs
    on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so
    that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He
    sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.
    SAM sobs with relief and love.
    
    
149 EXT.   THE ROAD                          NIGHT         149
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches then breasts
    the rise beyond which lies ... looking more than ever ...
    JILL'S VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a MIX ...
    
    
150 INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  NIGHT         150
    
    Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead.
    The reverse shot shows us JILL driving and SAM next to
    her. They glance at each other.
    
    
151 EXT.   SMALL ROAD                        EARLY MORNING 151
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then
    breasts the rise beyond which lies ... A STUNNINGLY
    BEAUTIFUL UNTOUCHED VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a
    MIX ...
    
    
152 EXT.   BEAUTIFUL VALLEY                  DAY           152
    
    Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with
    the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown
    up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke
    rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
    one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck
    has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
    vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some
    chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a
    basket of eggs.
    
    
153 INT.   HOUSE                             MORNING       153
    
    SAM is in the bed, just waking up. He opens his eyes,
    locking calm. Off screen we hear the door opening.
    
                       JILL (off screen)
               Morning. Sleep well?
    
    SAM nods his head slightly, on the pillow.
    
                              SAM
                    (quietly)
               I don't dream anymore.
                    (he embraces her)
    
    
154 EXT.   HOUSE AND GARDEN                  MORNING       154
    
    A high shot. Everything in the garden is definitely
    lovely. The music tells us. The music swells and the
    camera slowly pulls back, and back. It's a happy ending.
    And then, in the foreground, TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking
    straight at the camera. It is MR HELPMANN and JACK. They
    both shake their heads.
    
                          MR HELPMANN
               He's got away from us, Jack.
    
    CUT to their POV.
    
155 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM        DAY            155
    
    Sam is sitting in the IR chair. He is strapped in. His
    eyes are open but miles away. His face is wreathed in a
    benign and very happy smile.
    
                             JACK
               I'm afraid you're right, Mr.
               Helpmann. He's gone.
    
    A wide shot of the room shows us HELPMANN and LINT turn
    away and leave. SAM is left alone. He is humming.. The
    camera pulls back and back. The Information Retrieval room
    with SAM in it floats away into the most beautiful
    glorious sky ever.
    
    SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......
    
    
               "Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June,
               We stood beneath an amber moon,
               And softly murmured 'Some day soon'
               We kissed and clung together,
               Then, tomorrow was another day.
               The morning found me miles away,
               With still a million things to say,
               Now, when twilight beams the sky above,
               Recalling thrills of our love,
               There's one thing I'm certain of,
               Return, I will,
               To old Brazil."

INT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY

A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
background.
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
          This is a bad sign.
               (calling out)
          We really need to get a make-up
          person?!
The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.
                     ALLY
          Not in the budget. And not to                         *
                                                                *
          worry, you're going to look great
          in this.
She holds out a HAIR NET.
                     BRUCE
          A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
          net. I just did the hair.
                     ALLY
               (matter of fact)
          Health code. In the kitchen or
          around the cookie, you gotta have
          it.
                     BRUCE
               (to crew: re hair net)
          You guy's should tell me this
          before hand, this is like a huge
          waste of...moose.
Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
                     BRUCE
          Remind me to swing by an elementary                   *
          school after this and serve lunch.
Ally laughs.

                                                       2.



                     ALLY
          You're a thing of beauty.     In
          three, two, one. . .
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)
                    BRUCE
          For three decades the Kowolski
          Family Bakery has been a mainstay
          in downtown Buffalo. Known for
          their sinfully rich, cream filled,
          deep fried polski pierogis. And
          the occasional sugar induced coma
          that follows. Today, in honor of
          their 30 year anniversary, Momma
          Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
          Vol, decided to do something, a
          little bit different. Tell me
          guys, how did this idea come about?

                       GUSTOV
          Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
          don't    we make the biggest chocolate
          chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I
          said,    'Yeah, sure.'
                    BRUCE
          Wow. Fascinating.
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.
                    BRUCE
          The previous Buffalo cookie record
          was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
          Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
          cookie clearly proving that Gustov
          and Vol have much more free time.
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
                       BRUCE (CONT'D)
          As we witness the ceremonial
          toasting with milk it makes one
          pause and think. What are we
          really looking at here?
                       (MORE)

                                                        3.

                    BRUCE (CONT'D)
          Is it just a big cookie or does
          this cookie represent the pride of
          Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
          working citizens the key
          ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
          in.
              (motions his eyes to the
               Kowolski twins)
          And finally, the love of our
          families which provides the warm
          chewy center making our beloved
          Buffalo the sweetest place to live.

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.
                    BRUCE (CONT'D)
          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
          Eyewitness News.
Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
The frame FREEZES.
We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.
                    BRUCE
          So, what do you think?
                       GRACE
          It's good.
                       BRUCE
          It sucks. It's a story about a
          cookie. People with eating
          disorders will be riveted,
               (goes into huge pathetic
                fan character)
          Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
          I can't wait to vomit so I can make
          room for more cookies.
                       GRACE
          I thought it was funny. I love the
          hair net. How'd you get it to do
          that?

                                                             4.



                        BRUCE
          What? I'm cutting that. They made
          me wear that stupid thing. I don't
          even look like myself. The hair is
          one of the most important parts of
          an on camera persona. Right out of
          the gate, I lost the hair
          advantage.
Grace looks at a photo,
                        GRACE
          Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My
          sister is so drunk.
She places it in the album.
                        BRUCE
          Grace. Try to stay focused here.
          I need your help.
                     GRACE
          Aren't you taking this a little too
          seriously?
                        BRUCE
           It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
           There's an anchor job open. This
           is important. This is our future!
Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.
                        GRACE
           I'm sorry.
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
has a fragile temperament.
                     BRUCE
               (sighs)
          I'm never going to get anchor doing
          these kind of assignments. I want
          my work to matter.
                     GRACE
          It does matter. You're funny. You
          make people smile. Come on, take a
          break, help me put this album
          together.

                    BRUCE
               (reluctant)
          Alright.
Grace holds up a photo.
                    GRACE
          Oh look at this. It's the first
          day we moved in together.
It's the two of them, younger, laughing.
                      BRUCE
               (down)
          Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
                    GRACE
          Oh, here's me at my sister's
          wedding. I caught the bouquet.
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.
                    BRUCE
          You look pretty intense, hun.
                    GRACE
          Well, I was thinking about you.
Grace cuddles into Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          So, you're attracted to me in some
          way, is that what you're trying to
          say?
Grace rolls over onto Bruce.
                    GRACE
          You have no idea.
                    BRUCE
          I was saving myself for the wedding
          night, but if you keep this up, I
          may lose my resolve.
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.
                    GRACE
          Well, that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.

                                                           6.



                       BRUCE
            Hey, that's a good line, but you
            need more resonance. From the
            diaphragm.
                (newscaster voice)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      GRACE
            Oh, say it again.
                      BRUCE
                (bigger)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      GRACE
                (sweet, southern groupie)
            Oh, I just love on-air
            personalities.
                       BRUCE
                 (newscaster voice)
            Well then, let me take these
            clothes off and slip into my hair
            net.
Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the
bedroom.
                                            CUT TO:
A TELEVISION SCREEN

We see the INTRO FOR SIXTY MINUTES:

LESLIE STAHL is HIT IN THE NECK WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART.
Her head wavers, then DROPS on the desk. The camera PANS to
BRUCE, who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera.
                      BRUCE
            ...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty
            Minutes.
THE SIXTY MINUTES TICKING CLOCK

BRUCE'S ALARM CLOCK - IT RINGS
We are in. . .

                                                            7.



INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace
hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Sweety, time to get up...
She kisses Bruce, gets up.
                    BRUCE
          No, I'm having a great dream.
The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.   Bruce throws a mock
hissy fit.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.
                     SPORTSCASTER
          ...and the Sabers lost another
          close one last night. Four to
          three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
                     BRUCE
          Of course they lost, they're my
          team.
                                            CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER

Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-
off.
                     BRUCE
          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."
               (calls to Grace)
          You know, I think there might be
          something to that cookie line.
          Everything great anchor has his own
          signature sign-off.
               (as Walter Cronkite)
          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."
ANGLE - SAM

Peeing in the corner on the carpet.

                                                              8.


                     BRUCE
          Oh no!   Grace, the dog!
                    GRACE (O.S.)
          I'm in the shower!
                     BRUCE
          Ah!
INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE
Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms
dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.
                    BRUCE
          Whoops, sorry.
EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam
looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, you're all done, huh?
          B-e-a-utiful.
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING
Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars
unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.
                    GRACE
          Wow, nice car, huh?
                     BRUCE
          Yeah, if you want to rub your
          success in people's faces.
Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.
                     BRUCE
          What's with the hubbub?
                     GRACE
          We're having a blood drive.
                    BRUCE
          Creepy. Needles, yech...
                     GRACE
          Oh, that's a nice response.

                                                       9.



                     BRUCE
          I mean, it's just s o . . .
                    GRACE
          Helpful and life saving?
                    BRUCE
          C'mon, that's your...blood. It's
          in your body and I don't think it's
          supposed to come out. Besides,
          they stockpile that stuff. They
          have an endless supply frozen in a
          warehouse somewhere then tell
          everyone there's a shortage.

                    GRACE
          They do not. Now stop it. I'm                        *
          giving. I have a very rare blood                     *
          type, AB positive.
                    BRUCE
          Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive
          they aint touchin' me with no
          needle.
Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
                      GRACE
                (suddenly remembers
                 something)
          O. . .
          h
She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.
                    BRUCE
          What's that?
                    GRACE
          Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.
          Keep you safe.
                      BRUCE
          Well, I hope they work, cause it's
          going take a miracle to get me to
          work on time.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the
prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.

                                                          10.



A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's
screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is
oblivious.
                       BRUCE
             This is just my luck.
Bruce's BEEPER sounds.      He checks it.
                        BRUCE.
             The meeting's starting, perfect...
                  (thinks)
             Screw it.
He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
                       BRUCE
                 (laughs)
             Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's
             kill or be killed, only the strong
             survive, no guts, no glory1
SFX: SIREN
Bruce pulls over, fumes.
                        BRUCE
                  (looking heavenward)
             Thank you.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS
MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN
reads:
                  R EWE BLIND?
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.

                                                         1.
                                                         1

                     BOBBY
          Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.
          Don't even move, I got somethin'
          special today. My mom made it just
          for you.
                     BRUCE
          Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-
          I'm late...
                     BOBBY
               (bending down)
          You like Quiche?
He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
                     BOBBY
          You know, contrary to popular
          belief the quiche was actually
          invented by the Mayans, then stolen
          by the French. They shoulda said,
          "Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
          Mayan!"
Bobby belts out a laugh.
                    BRUCE
          Bobby, I can't, I--
                     BOBBY
          Just taste it, taste it...
Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking
it with exasperation.
                     BRUCE
          Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.
                     BOBBY
          That's a buck seventy-five.
                     BRUCE
          Can you get Kelly- Ahh...
Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
cash.
                     BOBBY
               (excited)
          Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
          five, two-ten...

                                                       12.



Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.
                    BOBBY
          Way out of our league, huh?
Bruce offers his money to Bobby.
                     BOBBY
          You know, I saw them editing your
          cookie piece.

                     BRUCE
          Really?

                    BOBBY
          They must have gotten high or
          something, cause they was orderin'
          everything, I had. Hey, how long
          have you been interested in pastry?
          'Cause I've got an aunt who makes
          baklava twenty layers deep.

                     BRUCE
               (holding money out)
          Bobby.
                     BOBBY
               (gets a brilliant idea)
          Maybe you could do a story on her!
Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
                    BRUCE
          Keep the change.
                     BOBBY
               (calling after)
          I'll give her a call, we'll talk
          about it later!
INT. STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY

ON THE MONITOR:

                     EVAN
          Is something killing your kids?
          Find out tonight at eleven.
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.

                                                        13.



IN THE ROOM
The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group
is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,
perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally
Loman.

                    JACK
          Okay, promos are approved, let's--
                    ALLY
          Ah, isn't that last one a little
          misleading? I mean, the story's
          about flu shots. Do we have to
          scare people to death?
                    EVAN
          No, just into watching. Or I could
          change it to: "Slow news day, come
          yawn with us. At eleven."
                    FRED
          Sniffles at eleven is nice.
                    DALLAS
          Attack of the killer sniffles?
                    ALLY
              (to Dallas)
          The tanning booth is starting to
          zap your brain, you know that?
                    DALLAS
          I don't use a tanning booth.
A beat and they all crack up.
                    FRED                                        *
          Come on. You're turning orange.                       *
                    EVAN                                        *
          He looks Florida ripe to me.         .                *
More laughs.                                                    *

                                                     14.



                    JACK
          I would have swore I already said
          this, but promos are approved. Now                  *
          can we move on?                                     *
                    ALLY
          Jack, shouldn't the promos be                       *
          focusing on Pete's retirement.
          This is his last week.
                    EVAN
              (leading)
          Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open
          anchor position, Jack?
                     JACK
          Evan, you'11 know something when I
          know something.
Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't
need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
                    BRUCE
          Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.
          The traffic was -- You guys already
          played the spots?
                    JACK
          Nice story, Bruce, but we're going
          with Evan's piece on the sex
          scandal at the mayor's office for
          sweeps.
This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.
                    EVAN
          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.
                    EVAN
          I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.
          See you've got to remember that the
          news room is like a cookie...
More laughs.
                    BRUCE
               (re: Evan's perfect
                posture)
          That's great Evan.
                      (MORE)

                                                          15.

                    BRUCE (cont'd)
          Is you're posture naturally that
          good, or do you have to shove a
          stick up there?
                    JACK
          Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're
          holding your story in reserve.
          Now, can we get back to the board
          so we have something to air today?
Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce
slides down into his chair, deflated.
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce
catches up .to him.
                    BRUCE
          Jack, Jack, hey.     Can I talk to you
          for a second?
                    JACK
          Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
                    BRUCE
          Sweeps.
Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.
                    BOBBY
          Don't worry about it.    I called my
          aunt, we're on.
Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.
                     BRUCE
          Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm
          getting desperate man, I am pushing
          forty and what have I got to show
          for it? The point is, I've hit
          some kind of a ceiling here. Some
          kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
          Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
          He gets the good stories, he gets
          on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more
          like Evan.

                    JACK
          You don't want to be like Evan.
          Evan's an asshole.
                    BRUCE
          I can be an asshole.

                                                          16.



                          JACK
             No, Bruce.     You can't.
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
for a beat.
                       JACK
             Are you going to pick that up?
                       BRUCE
             Yeah, I'm sorry.
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.
                       BRUCE
             It's just- this anchor position
             looming, it's gotten me nuts...
He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA
saunters by.
               JACK                               BRUCE
Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan.
                          SUSAN ORTEGA
             Hi, Jack.
Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
                       JACK

          Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.

He shakes his head "no."

He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter.

          Oh, my gosh.
                    BRUCE
          This is happening for us, Grace.
          What we've always talked about.
          Jack practically came out and told
          me.
Grace quickly switches gears.   She experienced the premature-
celebration before.
                    GRACE
          Wait, what do you mean practically?
                    BRUCE
          Well, he didn't spell it out, but
          this is exactly what happened to
          Susan Ortega right before she was
          bumped up to the desk.
                    GRACE
              (being cautious)
          I just want to make sure we're not
          getting too ahead of ourselves.
                    BRUCE
          I totally agree, but in the mean
          time you should start thinking
          about what coast you want to live
          on.
Ally interrupts, indicating the time.

Some of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed.

ON TV

Pete Fineman is reporting.
                     PETE FINEMAN
           ...but because of the fast response
           by our local fire fighters, the
           toxic chemicals were cleaned up
           without incident. Susan.
The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA:
                     SUSAN
           Bruce Nolan is standing by at
           Niagara Falls with a report on the
           Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat,
           but before we go live to Bruce, we
           have an announcement to make. As
           everyone knows, after 33 years, our
           beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.
Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.
                      SUSAN
           Pete's shoes are virtually
           impossible to fill, but the show
           must go on. And we could think of
           no one better than our very own
           Evan Baxter.
ON BRUCE

Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in
shock.
Evan is seated next to Susan.

          Congratulations, Evan. Looks like
          we'll be sitting side by side from
          now on.
                    EVAN
          Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and
          honored. Like you said, no one can
          replace the great Pete Fineman, but
          I'll do my best. I have to say I
          am so proud to be a part of our
          local community. Of Buffalo. I
          think a great city is a lot like a
          great recipe really. Put in some
          hard working citizens, add some
          care givers, maybe a few nuts...
The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his"
joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.
                     EVAN (CONT'D)
          All sprinkled with the strength and
          love of our good families, that
          ultimately creates a sweet place to
          live. Thank you.

The Old Woman doesn't know what to say.

          were safe floating on the big door?
          Do you think he would have survived

          Errodiiiing...
INT. NEWS ROOM - DAY
All work has stopped. Stunned staffers stare at the monitor.
INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jack stands with his jaw dropped, snaps out of it.
                     JACK
          Alright, cut the feed! Cut to
          black if you have to.

EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - CONTINUOUS
Bruce is now licking the camera lens.    He steps back and
signs-off. Smooth as silk.
                     BRUCE
          I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness
          news. Back to you fuckers 1
INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - .CONTINUOUS
Susan Ortega stares frozen blankly into camera.
                                           SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Bruce is TOSSED OUT THE FRONT DOORS, his box of possessions
spilling on the ground. Bruce FLAILS at the building.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE.
A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him
around, breaking and painting over his signs.
Instinctively, Bruce walks over.
                    BRUCE
          Hey, come on guys. What are you
          doin'? Just leave him alone.
They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off.    Bruce helps
the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.
                    BRUCE
          Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.
They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce
attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,
swinging and kicking.
Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We
hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the
gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.
Reveal Bruce's car, WINDOW'S SMASHED, PAINT SCRAPED and the
word "HERO" KEY SCRATCHED ON THE DOOR.
                    BRUCE
          B-e-a-utiful.
               (looks up)

                    BRUCE (cont'd)
          Just what you get for trying to
          help someone.
Bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the
Homeless Man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign
"LIFE IS. JUST"
                    BRUCE
          Get a clue, buddy.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bruce is pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip.
                    GRACE
          Thank God you're alright.
                    BRUCE
          God, yeah. Let's thank God.
          Thanks for everything, Lord. I am
          so honored that my horrible demise
          is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.
                    GRACE
          Bruce, don't talk like that.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, don't worry, he's not
          listening. If he is he doesn't
          care. Have you seen the news
          lately? We got gangs, we got
          drugs, we got corruption. What
          kind of God lets that happen?
          Every time we cure a disease he
          comes up with a new one!
              (goes into God character)
          Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's
          God. They've just come up with a
          treatment for syphilis down there.
          I think it's time to release the
          tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a
          guy in Ohio who's praying for
          strength and wisdom, blind him and
          cut off his legs.
                    GRACE
          So God is torturing us?
                    BRUCE
          Think about it, Grace. God is all-
          powerful . He could fix everything
          in five minutes if he wanted to.

                    BRUCE (cont'd)
          But he doesn't want to. He doesn't
          like me.
Sam starts PEEING ON THE RUG.

                     BRUCE
          Oh, Perfect!
              (to the dog)
          But you're aim isn't so good, I'm
          over herel
                    GRACE
          Bruce, please. This isn't his
          fault.
                    BRUCE
          Of course not.
              (hushed tone)
          It's part of the mysterious plan.
Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Honey, you're mad right now. It's
          understandable. And what Evan did
          was slimy and wrong. But your job
          doesn't matter to me. You matter
          to me. You could've really been
          hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.

                    BRUCE
          Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi
          And I'm not okay with the fact that
          you think everything is okay. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre job. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre apartment.
          I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE!
Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the
photo albums to floor.
                    GRACE
          Is that what you have, Bruce?
          A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry
          for being a piece in your mediocre
          puzzle.
                    BRUCE
          Terrific. I'm drowning and you
          throw me a brick!
Grace starts to cry.

                                                                  30.



                        BRUCE
            Perfect! I'll have the worst day
            of my life with a side order of
            guilt, please. I-- I don't need
            this.
Bruce grabs his keys and heads out.

INT. CAR - NIGHT
It's RAINING now. Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular.
His frustration is turning to desperation.
                        BRUCE
            Okay, God. You want me to talk to
            you? Then talk back. Tell me
            what's going on? What should I
            do? Give me a sign...
Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't
notice. . .
                      BRUCE
            I'm right here. Speak to me.
A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of
the way.
                      PEDESTRIAN
            SLOW DOWN, ASSHOLE!

Bruce is oblivious.
                        BRUCE
            All I need is some guidance.
            Please send me a signal.
A TRUCK TRANSPORTING VARIOUS ROAD SIGNS pulls in front of
Br uce . F our way s, bli nki ng. The va rie d s igns re ad: Yi eld ,
Wrong Way, Dead End, Do Not Enter, Stop.

                       BRUCE
            Oh well, I guess you don't care.
Bruce spots the PRAYER BEADS hanging on the rearview mirror.
                        BRUCE
            Okay, we'll do it your way.
                 (pulls the beads from the
                  mirror)
            Lord, I need a miracle. Please
            help me.

                                                               31.



He hits a bump and the BEADS DROP TO THE FLOOR.        Bruce
reaches down, fishes for the beads...
                      BRUCE
           Come on, where'd you go?
                (holds them up in triumph)
           Ah ha! AHHH!
And BAM!11 BRUCE'S CAR SLAMS INTO A LIGHT POST.

EXT. STREET - LAKE EERIE - CONTINUOUS
Bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at
the beads in his hands. He begins to laugh maniacally.
He spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman,
HEAVES THE PRAYER BEADS INTO THE LAKE. He looks heavenward,
challenging the Infinite.
                    BRUCE
          Okay, if that's the way you want
          it. The gloves are off, pal! Let
          me see a little wrath! Smite me oh
          mighty smiteri What, no pestilence
          no boils? Come on, you got me on
          the ropes, don't you want to finish
          me off?! You're the one who should
          be fired! The only one around here
          not doing his job is YOU! What are
          we, you're little pet project? A
          hobby you tinker with now and
          again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!!
A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically
chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.
                     BRUCE
           Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't
           call you if I did.
Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN.
                                             CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - AN ALARM CLOCK

The BEEPING continues. We are in. . .

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for
the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up,
begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.

                                                          32.



                    BRUCE
          Well, hello again 772-5623, don't
          hold your breath.
Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.
The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens
the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS
against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the
bathroom.
INT. BATHROOM

A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture
of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says:
"I LOVE YOU.    WE NEED TO TALK.
Grace"

Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the
rug.
                       BRUCE
          Oh, no.
EXT. STAIR WELL - CONTINUOUS
Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam.
EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

Bruce sets Sam on the grass. Sam looks up, finished.
                     BRUCE
          What's the point?
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...

Bruce walks over to the shattered beeper. He picks up a
small piece of it containing the LED read out: 772-5623
ON BRUCE - AMAZED

                                         CUT TO:

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

A PHONE - BRUCE DIALS THE NUMBER

A PRERECORDED VOICE ANSWERS

                                                           33.



                       COMPUTERIZED VOICE
             Denied that promotion at work? Is
             life unfair? Everywhere you turn
             is there someone less talented than
             you reaping all the benefits ? Is
             your name Bruce? Then do we have
             the job for you. We're located at
             77256 23rd Street...
Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address.
                       COMPUTERIZED VOICE
             So come on down, or we'll just keep
             beepin' ya.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign
painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS.
Bruce's demolished car enters frame.      He studies the area and
building suspiciously.
Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS
IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.
                        BRUCE
             Perfect.
He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.
INT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY
Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY.      It reads:
OMNI PRESENTS UNLTD.

Pers onnel    Rm. 7
Ac coun ting Rm. 7
Security      Rm . 7
Creativ e     Rm. 7
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             You're looking for room 7.
Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor.     He looks at
Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.
                       JANITOR
             Want me to even those up for you?

                                                            34.


                     BRUCE
               (feigns a smile)
          How would I get to room 7?
                     JANITOR
          That'd be on the seventh floor.
          Stairs are right over there.
                     BRUCE
          What about the elevator?
He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.
                     JANITOR
          Out of order.
Bruce heads for the stairs.
                     JANITOR
          You mind giving me a hand with this
          floor?
                    BRUCE
          What? Yeah, I mind.
He continues on.

SEVENTH FLOOR

The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE
DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space.
Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending
into a hole in the ceiling.
                     BRUCE
          Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah,
          looking for whoever runs this
          joint...
                     MAN (O.S.)
          Be right with y.a, just fixin' a
          light. Tell me if it's working?
CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining
down blinding Bruce.

                     BRUCE
          Yep, seems to be.
               (wiping his eyes)
          Kinda bright, though.

                                                         35.



An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the
ladder.
                    MAN (O.S.)
          Yeah, it is for most people. They
          spend their lives in the dark...
As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is
the SAME JANITOR.
                      JANITOR (CONT'D)
          . . . thinkin' they can hide from me.
The two stand, angelically illuminated.    Bruce tries to put
everything together.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
                    JANITOR
          Yeah, but I'll get around to it.
The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.
                    BRUCE
          You installed a clapper?
                     JANITOR
          Nope.   Catchy jingle, though.
              (sings)
          CLAP ON. CLAP OFF.    CLAP ON, CLAP
          OFF. THE CLAPPER.
               (claps twice)
          You can't get it out of your head.
                    BRUCE
          I gotta go.
                    JANITOR
          Okay, but the boss'11 be right out.
The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.
He extends his hand to Bruce.
                    JANITOR
          You must be Bruce. I've been
          expecting you.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, this is hilarious. So you're
          the boss and the electrician and
          the janitor.

                                                         36.



                     JANITOR
          Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your
          sleeves, son. People underestimate
          the benefits of good 'ol manual
          labor. There's freedom in it.
          Happiest people in the world stink
          like hell at the end of the day.
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.
                     JANITOR
          Your father knew that. He was a
          damn good welder.
Bruce approaches the desk.
                     BRUCE
          How do you know my father? And how
          did you get my pager number?
                     JANITOR
          Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce.
          Pretty much everything there is to
          know. Everything you've ever said,
          done or thought about doin', is
          right there in that file cabinet.
He points out a single drawer file cabinet.
                     BRUCE
               (sarcastic)
          Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?
          Mind if I take a look?
                     JANITOR
          It's your life.
Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE
FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM --
The Janitor casually pulls a file.
                     JANITOR
          Now this last entry was a little
          disturbing.
He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor
reads from the file.
                     JANITOR
               (reads, scanning)
          Thanks for everything, Lord.
                     (MORE)

                                                         37.

                      JANITOR (cont'd)
          I am so honored that my horrible
          demise is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.. The gloves are
          off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty
          smiter.
               (aside)
          I'm not much for blaspheming but
          that one made me laugh. Oh, and
          let's not forget "What kind of a
          God would let this happen? I mean,
          have you seen then news lately?"
Bruce stands, dazed. ·
                     BRUCE
          Who are you?
                     JANITOR
          I'm the creator of the heavens and
          the earth. I'm the alpha & omega.
          The first and the last.
                     BRUCE
          Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.
                     JANITOR/GOD
          I'm God, Bruce.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, you're God. Well that explains
          everything1 That's how you know
          everything about me. That's how
          you got up to the seventh floor so
          quickly.
               (placating)
          Well, it's really nice to meet you.
          Thanks for the Grand Canyon and,
          ah, good luck with the apocalypse.
Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD
GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.
                     BRUCE
          Okay, I don't know how you're doing
          that, but I really gotta go. This
          place is obviously rigged in some
          way. We're on some freaky hidden
          camera show.
               (playing to the "cameras")
          ...for which I will not sign a
          release, by the way! But you know
          what, I'd be a little more
          impressed if you didn't use the
          cheesy file cabinet illusion.
                     (MORE)

                                                               38.

                        BRUCE      (cont'd)
              Everyone with a      brain in their head
              would know that      the drawer is being
·             fed through the       wall from behind--
    Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a
    normal back.
                           BRUCE
              Okay.     That's good.   That's a good
              one.
    Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.
                        BRUCE
              Okay, God. How many fingers am I
              holding out?
    Bruce extends three fingers.
                           GOD
              Three.
    He quickly pulls one finger in.
                           GOD
              Two.
    Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't miss a
    beat.
                        GOD
              Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One...
    One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.
                        BRUCE
              Okay, how about now.
    He quickly pulls in two fingers.
                           GOD
              Seven.

                          .BRUCE
              AH HAl
    Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
    fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS
    ON HIS ONE HAND.

                          BRUCE
              AAAHHHl

                                                             39,



He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers
disappear. God approaches Bruce.
                    GOD
          You've been doing a lot of
          complaining about me, Bruce. And
          quite frankly, I'm tired of it...
Bruce backs away from God.
                    BRUCE
          You stay away from me! I don't
          know what your doing. But whatever
          you're doing is probably
          actionable!
                    GOD
          Well, that's not very neighborly.
          I brought you here to offer you a
          job.
                    BRUCE
          Job? Wh at job?
                     GOD
          My job. You think you can do it
          better, so here's your chance.
          When you leave this building you
          will be endowed with all my powers.
                    BRUCE
          Sure, whatever you say, Pal.
He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor
uniform, holding the mop.
                     GOD
          All the power of God.
Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and
God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce
sprints out of the room.
EXT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY
Bruce barrels out of the building --
                     BRUCE
          Okay, that did not happen.
He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this
time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He
paus es f or a bea t --

                                                           40.



                     BRUCE
          No.

He races on.

INT. BRUCE'S CAR

Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't
start.
                    BRUCE
          I'm having a breakdown. That's
          what it is. Just a normal,
          everyday psychotic episode, brought
          on by tumor or brain lesion...
We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key
pounds the steering wheel in frustration.
                    BRUCE
              (to the car)
          Come on, startI
The car INSTANTLY starts.
                     BRUCE
               (denial)
          Well, that was lucky.
Bruce backs up, peels out.
MUSIC UP: "HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS"

EXT. CITY STREETS

Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,
immediately stops whistling.
                     BRUCE
          Okay, just relax here. I did not
          meet God and I do not have his
          powers.
               (laughs)
          If that was God, then I'm Mario
          Andretti.
Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic,
dodging and passing cars right and left.
                     BRUCE
          AAAHHHHHHHH!J!

                                                            41.


Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing
before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the
man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited
Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the
professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG
TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the
driver's window.
                    PAUL NEWMAN
          Hey Mario, did you get that box of
          dressing I sent you?
Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --
                    BRUCE
              (in perfect Italian)
          Si, dovete venire sopra per il
          pranzo un certo tempo.
              (SUBTITLES: Yes, you must
               come over for dinner some
               time.)
Bruce reacts shocked.   The crew backs off and urges him on in
Italian.
                     PIT CREW
          Vete l Ve tel
Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control
the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door
won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.

He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal
looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a
diner.
INT. DINER - DAY
Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other
patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.
                    BRUCE
          It isn't real, it isn't real, it
          isn't real...
An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand,
stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.
                    BRUCE
          Oh hi, ah, coffee please.
The waitress pours him a cup.

                                                         42.



                    WAITRESS
          We've got a special on soup today.

                    BRUCE
          No, that's okay.
                    WAITRESS
          It's tomato.
                    BRUCE
          Alright, okay.
She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real?
He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
                    BRUCE
          Excuse me I need a spoooo...
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.
                     BRUCE
          That's alright, I found one.
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
                     WAITRESS
          I lie to my sister.
                     BRUCE
          What?
                     WAITRESS
               (becoming emotional)
          And I'm sleeping with my best
          friend's husband. I know he's just
          using me but.. I'm just so tired of
          being alone. I don't know why I'm
          telling you all this. Just seems
          like you'd understand.
                     BRUCE
          Okay.

                                                       43.



                     WAITRESS
               (sets the check down)
          Take care of that whenever you're
          ready.
Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense.   He slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl....
MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME

The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner
and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE
PARTS HIS RED SOUP.
A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
                    GOD (O.S.)
          Havin' fun?
Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing
beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.
                    BRUCE
          You- He- Thy...
                    GOD
          Let's take a walk.
EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY

God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.
                     GOD
               (re: the cockroach)
          Most people want to kill these
          guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very
          streamlined design. Like little
          armored tanks. Y'know, they can
          hold their breath for forty minutes
          and their cells divide only once
          per molting cycle creating a
          cytoskeleton with cell adhesion
          that...
               (catching himself)
          Oh, this is a bit over your head,
          isn't it?
Off Bruce's look.

                                                        44.



                    GOD
          Okay, let me explain the rules.
                     BRUCE
          Rules ?
                    GOD
          Yeah, you left in such a rush I
          didn't get a chance to explain.
                    BRUCE
          Well the two extra fingers freaked
          me out a little bit.
                     GOD
               (laughs)
          I figured that would get your
          attention.. I did the same thing to
          Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
          weeks. Now, here's the deal. You
          have all my power. Use it any way
          you choose. There are only two
          rules. You can't tell anyone
          you're God. Believe me you don't
          want that kind of attention. And
          you can't mess with free will.
                     BRUCE
          Uh huh.   Can I-ask why?
                    GOD
              (excited)
          Yes you can. That's the beauty it.
Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.   Bruce
looks to the sail, oddly, then...
WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE
about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass.
Bruce is awestruck.
                     BRUCE
          This is amazing.
                     GOD
          Oh, speaking of amazing...
God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.
He pockets them as he talks.

                                                         45.



                     GOD
           Since you're finished with these, I
           think I'll hang to 'em. Might come
           in handy someday.
WIDE MASTER - BUFFALO CITY-SCAPE

God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to
walk away.
                     GOD
           I'll be seein' ya.
                     BRUCE
           Where are you going?
                     GOD
           I'm taking a vacation.
                     BRUCE
           God can't take a vacation. Can he?
           Can you?
                     GOD
           Ever hear of the Dark Ages?
           Besides, I'm covered. You can fix
           everything in five minutes if you
           want to, right?
ON BRUCE
                       BRUCE
           ...Right.
Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,
progresses to a full sprint.
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand. Grace flips
through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items
from the cart to the conveyor belt.
In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is
grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the
belt.
                       GRACE
                (re: magazine)
           Gosh, this girl is so talented and
           all they ever talk about is her
           hair.

                                                       46.



                    DEBBIE
          Yeah, she should marry somebody
          famous, take the focus off.
Grace checks her cell phone screen.
                    DEBBIE
          We would have heard it ring.
                    GRACE
          I know. It's just that he usually
          calls during the day.
                    DEBBIE
          He just needs to blow off some
          steam, he'll be fine.
                    GRACE
          I hope so. I've never seen him                        *
          that mad. An d I lashed back--                        *
                    DEBBIE
          Wow, you lashed? You never lash.
          I'm impressed.
                    GRACE
          I feel bad for him.   He's wanted
          anchor for so long.
Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.
                    DEBBIE
          Well, I've been praying to win the
          lottery for fifteen years, but it's
          not going to happen. You know,
          it's not all about money.
The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.
                    CLERK
          That'll be four hundred and twenty-
          seven, eighty.-
                       DEBBIE
          What?!
Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter
items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred
or so Tic-Tac mint containers.
                      DEBBIE
          Zoe.
                 (to Clerk)
                       (MORE)

                                                           47.

                       DEBBIE (cont'd)
             Hang on, I might need you to un-
             check a few things.
The people in line hem and haw, exasperated.
                       GUY IN LINE
             Come on, lady.
                     DEBBIE
               (snaps)
          Hey, everybody back-off i
Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.
                     GRACE
          Listen, I better get back. I want
          to be there for him.
                    DEBBIE
          You're a saint, Grace.
                    GRACE
          What can I say, I love him. And if
          I know Bruce, he's out there
          wandering around with the weight of
          the world on his shoulders.

                                            CUT T0:

EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK
Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.
He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS
WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing.
A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she
passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.
                    BRUCE
          And he saw that it was good.
He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a
cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens
them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is
dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.
Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up,
hanging out in the alley.
                    BRUCE
          B-e-a-utifull

                                                              48.


EXT. ALLEY

Bruce approaches the gang.
                       BRUCE
             Hey guys, remember me?
The gang members turn to Bruce.
                       HOOD #1
             Oh look, it's the hero.
                       HOOD #2
             Hungry for another can of whoop-
             ass?
                        HOOD #3
             Your stereo sounds great in my car,
             man.
He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.
                       BRUCE
             Look, I don't want to fight you
             guys. So as soon as you apologize,
             I'll be on my way.
A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle
behind, surrounding Bruce.
                       HOOD #1
             Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The
             day a monkey climbs out of my butt.
                        BRUCE
             What a coincidence. That's today.
The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a
MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.
The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.
                       BIG GUY
             Did that come out of your butt,
             man?
Hood #1 faints from shock.
                       BRUCE
             Now I'm going to have to teach the
             rest of you guys a lesson.

                                                         49.



                     HOOD #2
           Yeah, you and whose army?
                     BRUCE
           Just me... and me...
ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.
                     BRUCE
           And me, and me, and me, me, me, me,
           me and me and me.
As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from
various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a
dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.
                      BRUCE
           PILE ON THE RABBIT1
T HE B RUGES CONV ERGE ON TH E GA NG --

Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES --
ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him
down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five --
A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to
ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of
a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head --
ON THE MONKEY - SCREECHING, ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT

Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily
watching the mayhem.
                      HOOD #2
           Let's get out of here, manl
Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.
                      BRUCE
           Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal
The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.
                      BRUCE
           I'll take it from here.
Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A
SWARM OF LOCUSTS --

                                                             50.



EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN
LOCUSTS.
Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.        He looks down
to the monkey.
                     BRUCE
           Back home for you, little one.
The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1
stumbling to his feet.
                       HOOD #1
           NoI   NOOOOO1
He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.
ON BRUCE
He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the
unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.
                                            CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - BRUCE

We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of
Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He
looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and
proclaims to the world.
                      BRUCE
           I AM THE LORD THY BRUCE ALMIGHTY.
           MY WILL BE DONE I
Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes
behind him. He is an awesome god.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box
of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine,
sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine.
                      GRACE
                (to Sam)
           Well, at least I have someone to
           drink with.
Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.

                                                       51.



                     BRUCE
          What if God was one of us. . .
          Just a slob like one of us...
          Just a stranger on a bus...
          Trying to make his way. . .
Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets
up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile,
holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.
                    BRUCE
              (finishing song)
          ...home.
                    GRACE
              (re: the flowers)
          Oh, my God.
                    BRUCE
          You can call me Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Where have you been? You're
          so...happy.
                     BRUCE
          Who wouldn't be on a night like
          this?
               (holding out the flowers)
          For you.
Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up
his mood.
                    GRACE
          These are amazing. What are they?
                    BRUCE
          It's a totally new breed. A cross
          pollination between tulips and
          Daisies. I call them Todayzees.
                    GRACE
          Todayzees? Okay...
Grace goes to put them in water.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                    GRACE
          Bruce, is there something you're
          not telling me?

                                                            52.


                    BRUCE
          Nothing of this world. Why?
                    GRACE
          What do you mean, why? Last night
          you weren't exactly happy with
          life.
                    BRUCE
          Last night, I was only human.
Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he
passes.
                    BRUCE
          CD 4, Track 7.
The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays.
EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys
the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE
CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD.
Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon
and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL.
                                          CUT TO:
OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON
Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE
the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.
BACK TO SCENE
Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with
points of his finger.
Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the
perfectly orchestrated sky.
                     GRACE
          Wow, it really cleared up. I've
          never seen the moon that big.
Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind.

                                                        53.



                    BRUCE
          We shouldn't waste it.
Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a
METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.
                       BRUCE
          Bedroom.
                    GRACE
          Five minutes.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the
bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room,
BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES
with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair.
                    GRACE
          I'11 be out in a minute.

          Don't rush yourself. Sometimes                        *
          anticipation can heighten the                         *
          pleasure.                                             *
Grace SHUDDERS a bit at the word "pleasure", quickly finishes *
brushing, picks up her lipstick.                             *
                       BRUCE (O.S.)                             *
          It's a funny thing about, pleasure.                   *
GRACE'S KNEES BUCKLE, causing the lipstick to smear across *
her face. She sits down on the toilet seat to get a hold of *
herself.                                                    *
                       BRUCE (O.S.)                             *
          It can be extremely pleasurable.                      *
Grace has a very POWERFUL ORGASM and slides off the toilet *
out of frame to the ground.                                *
                       GRACE                                    *

BRUCE
Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the
bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light
hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a
casual pose.
Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal.
She dives on Bruce, attacking him.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
ON TV - THE MORNING NEWS
                     MORNING REPORTER
          In international news, Japanese
          relief workers are staging a
          desperate effort to rescue hundreds
          of people stranded by a freak tidal
          wave that hit Kitamoto City...
We see remote footage of Japanese families being airlifted
from root tops.
                     MORNING REPORTER
          Scientists say the tsunami may have
          been caused by what they're
          describing as "unusual lunar
          activity." More on this, as it
          develops. . .
Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Bruce lies blissfully asleep. Big smile, life is good.
Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant voices MURMURING all
at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around puzzled,
sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the
voices fade away.
ANGLE - SAM
Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. Bruce casually
warns.
                    BRUCE
          Sam. Uh uh uh.

                                                         55.



Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom,
raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and STANDS UP ON HIS
TWO HIND LEGS, HOLDING HIS SNAUSAGE WITH HIS FRONT PAWS (NO,
WE DON'T SEE IT) AND STARTS TO GO.   He looks proudly back at
Bruce.

                      BRUCE
          Good boy.

INT. KITCHEN

Grace places breakfast on the table. Bruce comes out, fully
dressed with a spring in his step.
                     BRUCE
          Good morning.
                     GRACE
               (gushy-lovey, sing songy)
          Good morning. Cooked you grilled
          cheese.
                     BRUCE
          Oo, my favey.
Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.
                     GRACE
          Last night was just...
                      BRUCE
          Heavenly?
                      GRACE
          Mmm hmm.
Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.
                      GRACE
          It's funny, but when I woke up this
          morning, It felt like my boobs were
          bigger.
Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.
                     GRACE
               (holding them up)
          Do they look bigger to you?
                     BRUCE
          Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the
          same to me.

                                                            56.


They aren't.    They are clearly bigger.      She holds them.
                      GRACE
            They're definitely bigger.      They
            feel huge to me.
Bruce throws up his hands.
                       BRUCE
            You got me. Probably just a
            hormonal thing.
                 (takes a quick final bite)
            Well, enjoy your breakfast, I've
            gotta run.
                      GRACE
            Where are you going?
He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.
                      BRUCE
            To get my job back.

Bruce turns the corner into bumper to bumper traffic. No

A POLICE DOG, HANK, performs some standard TAKE DOWNS by

          I certainly wouldn't want to be a
          fugitive on the run with Hank,
          Buffalo's number one police dog, on
          the job. This is Phil Sidleman
          reporting from The Police Canine
          Training center.
              (beat)
          And cut it. Let's go, guys.
The crew start to wrap up.

          Hey, channel seven, right? You're
          the guy that went crazy.
                    BRUCE
          Yeah, I had a bad day. But things
          are lookin' up.
                    PHIL
          What are you doin' here?
                    BRUCE
          Just lookin' for a story.
                    PHIL

          Well, this pond's fished out.
          Pretty standard stuff anyway.

                    BRUCE
          I don't know. My instinct tells me
          there's something more.
                    PHIL
          Well, go with that. It's served
          you well in the past, right?
Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of
their equipment into the van and shut the doors.

                     TRAINER (O.S.)
          Hey, Hank found something1

Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance.

Hank is DIGGING FURIOUSLY, making a BIG HOLE. The Policeman
jogs over, joins the trainer. They watch as TWO DRESS SHOES
ARE UNCOVERE D IN THE DI RT. Hank BARKS.

                     POLICEMAN

scramble around the van.

          The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
          uncovered in a field today outside
          of a canine training center in
          Buffalo New York. Local Buffalo
          freelance field reporter Bruce
          Nolan was the first on the scene...

                                                         59.


We cut to the pre-taped story. Bruce stands with Hank and
his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him.
                    BRUCE
          Since the disapearence of Teamster
          president Jimmy Hoffa in the
          nineteen sixties, his whereabouts
          have remained one of this country's
          great unsolved mysteries. That is
          until just moments ago, when during
          a routine training session, a
          police dog named Hank sniffed his
          way right into the history books.
          As you can see behind us, the body
          is being carefully exhumed and will

EXT. NEWS STATION - DAY
As Bruce pulls up in front of the building the NO PARKING
SIGN flies back into the bushes and the RED CURB TRANSFORMS
TO GREEN as though being sloppily painted with invisible
brushes.
Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy,
who sits in his usual spot. His sign reads:
"HEAVEN IS AT HAND.   LEGGO YOUR EGGO."

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Bruce cruises through the office, fielding greetings.

                                                           60.



                     VARIOUS OFFICE STAFF
          Nice Job, Bruce...Way to go,
          buddy...GO get 'em, Bruce, etc.
Susan Ortega smooths up to Bruce.
                       SUSAN ORTEGA
          Hi, Bruce.

                     BRUCE
               (surprised)
          Oh, Susan.. Hi.
                    SUSAN ORTEGA
          Good work, I'm impressed.
She give's Bruce a "look" and continues on. Bruce is a bit
inflated by the encounter.
Bobby the pastry cart guy wheels his cart up along side.

                     BRUCE
          That's the word.
                    BOBBY
          You're going to need your energy in
          there. Can I interest you in a
          donut?
                    BRUCE
          No, thank you, I'm not hungry.

                       BOBBY
          Yeah, I don't blame 'ya, they taste
          like grass.
Bobby CUTS BRUCE OFF WITH HIS CART.    Bruce is forced to stop.

                       BOBBY
          Tell you    what? I wasn't going to
          break it    open until lunch time, but
          I made a    batch of rhubarb that you
          have got    to try.
                       BRUCE

                       BOBBY
          Come on, it's my mother's recipe
          she's practically cripple...
Bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at Bruce.
                     BRUCE
          No, I really- no...
                       BOBBY

          No, Bobby.. Bobby N01 I said I
          didn't want anything.
               (turns, heading off)
          Damn you...
Bruce continues    off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd
expression, then    his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL
THE WAR AROUND,    THEN GLOW RED. LITTLE HORN BUMPS PUSH UP
FROM HIS SKULL.     He turns instantly demonic.

An overly PERKY FEMALE OFFICE WORKER approaches Bobby from
behind.
                     FEMALE OFFICE WORKER
          Hi, Bobby. Is there any of that
          split pea soup left?
She is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green
vomit. A beat and Bobby offers out a plastic spoon.

           mate, but that doesn't seem to be a
           problem today.

WIDE SHOT of the enclosure - PANDA'S are coupled off and

children's eyes, ushering them away from the exhibit.

Bruce finishes running a bath, gets into the tub but SLIPS as
is UNABLE TO SINK and ends up sliding around ON THE WATER
like on a sheet of glass. He tries to break through, can't.
Then, he concentrates and finally LOWERS INTO THE WATER.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY

Grace lies in full body wrap, while Debbie is in the process
of being wrapped by MARGARITA, a rather ruff Spanish Salon
attendant.
                    DEBBIE
          So this is what success buys you.
                    GRACE
          I guess.
              (wiggling around)
          I feel like a human taquito.
                    DEBBIE
          Well, thank Mr. Exclusive for me.
          He's on a quite a roll. What'd he
          do make a deal with the devil?
                     GRACE
          And he's taking me out tonight to
          dinner at Chez L'Amour.
                     DEBBIE
          Well, la-ti-da. Mike's idea of a
          romantic evening is Chez Sizzler.
Margarita pulls the wrap tightly around Debbie.
                     DEBBIE
               (to Margarita)
          What does this do again?
                    MARGARITA
          EstS para su grasa.
                    DEBBIE
          Grasa? Doesn't that mean fat?

                                                          71.



                       GRACE
          Afraid so.
Debbie eyes Margarita.
                    GRACE
              (gushing)
          So, Bruce said and I quote:
          "Prepare yourself for an amazing
          evening that will change our lives
          forever."
Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and YANKS tightly.
                     DEBBIE
          Good - you wouldn't want to leave
          any spare oxygen in there.
               (back to Grace)
          Wait a second, you don't think he's
          going to propose, do you?
                    GRACE
          I don't think anything.
                       DEBBIE
          You do. You think he's going to
          propose.
                       GRACE
          Well, he's always said when he gets
          his career together, you know...
          And his career is more than
          together. I mean, come on, Chez
          L'Amour. Change our lives...
                       DEBBIE
          I don't know, hun. I mean, I like
          Bruce but that man's priority list
          is him, him, him, then him some
          more and then you.
                     GRACE
          Well, he just might surprise you.
                     DEBBIE
          That's what I'm worried about.
               (re: Margarita)
          Careful, you missed a spot of free
          flowing circulation.
Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. Debbie
reacts.

                                                         72.


                    DEBBIE
          That'd do it.
Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves.    Debbie
struggles to lay down.
                    DEBBIE
          Let's see, how do I--
Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to
help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. They
both laugh and struggling to get up.
Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps.
                       MARGARITA
          Lesbianas1
Grace and Debbie crack up harder.
                    DEBBIE
          Hey, I'll take that over fat...
Margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too.
                    MARGARITA
          No sexo, no sexol
Grace and Debbie can't stop laughing.
INT. CHEZ L'AMOUR - NIGHT
A waiter pours the first trickle of wine into Bruce's glass.
Bruce whiffs it, tastes it.
                    BRUCE
          Very good. If you run out just
          bring me some water, I'll take it
          from there.
Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various
tables eyeing him. He glances up to a ceiling light and
REDIRECTS IT with his mind, so it SPOTLIGHTS HIM in golden
light.
TWO CUTE GIRLS with dates SMILE and wave.     He waves back.
                       GRACE
          Should we ask for a more private
          table?

                                                         73,



                    BRUCE
          Huh? Oh, no this is fine right
          here.
Bruce looks at Grace lovingly.      He takes her hand.
                    BRUCE
          I was going to wait until after the
          meal, but I think it's going to
          just bust out of me if I don't do
          it now.
Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love.
                       BRUCE
          You ready?
                    GRACE
              (nervous)
          I think so.
                    BRUCE
          I got anchor.
Grace's face falls.    She does her best to cover.
                       BRUCE
          Evidently, they're having problems
          with Evan. He's finishing up the
          week and I go live Monday.
                    GRACE
          That's great, honey.
          Congratulations. Wow. So that's
          what's tonight is about?
                       BRUCE
          Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor.
          We got anchor!
She's having a hard time covering her let down.
                     BRUCE
               (noticing her flat
                reaction)
          What's the matter?
                       GRACE
          Well, to be honest, I thought that
          maybe tonight, you--
The TWO CUTE GIRLS interrupt, approach Bruce.

                                                                       74.



                                  CUTE GIRL #1
                       I'm sorry, but we had to come over.
                       We just think you're amazing and...
                                 CUTE GIRL #2
                       Well, we can't believe it's you!
             They both laugh, Bruce enjoys the attention.
                                  BRUCE
                            (laughing along)
                       Yep, it's me.
                                  CUTE GIRL #1
                       Can we get a picture with you?
                                  BRUCE
                       Well, sure.
                            (glances to Grace)
                       Just one second, hun.
                            (leans to Grace)
                       Fans. We better get used to this,
                       huh?
             Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on
             Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the
             attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they
r"sS!w^w!s
             leave. Grace is clearly upset.
                                  GRACE
                       You have lipstick on your face.
                                  BRUCE
                       Oh, thanks...
                                 GRACE
                       Bruce, we need to talk. I thought
                       we had an understanding--
             Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around,
             figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.
                                 BRUCE
                       Wow. It's kind of loud in here.
             Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.
                                 GRACE
                       What are you talking about? It's
                       not loud.
             The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.

                                                         75.



                     BRUCE
          Geez...
               (shouts to the restaurant)
-----   - COULD YOU ~KEEP TT DOWNl---  --
                     GRACE
          Bruce, this isn't funny.
                       BRUCE
               (talking loud .over the
                "racket")
          WHAT? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A
          SECOND?
He gets up and darts off.
INT. CHEZ L'AMOUR KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears -
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps his
ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We
start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me,"
etc.
Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,
covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE --
Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A HIGH
MOUNTAIN PEAK.
                     GOD (O.S.)
          Really something isn't it?
God sits down next to Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          Is this heaven?
God laughs at this one.
                     GOD
          It's Everest. You should try
          flipping on the Discovery Channel
          every now and then. Well, I guess
          you can't now, being dead and all.
                       BRUCE
          I'm dead?I
God laughs.

                                                         76.



                    GOD
          No, I'm just messing with you.
                    BRUCE
          Those voices...
                    GOD
          They're prayers, Bruce. You keep
          ignoring them and they're going to
          build up on. you like that. You
          didn't think being God was going to
          be all fun and games did you?
                    BRUCE
          Prayers? Those are prayers? Why
          can't I understand them?
God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.
                    GOD
          You aren't listening, son. Let's
          see, you've had my powers for over
          a week now and how many people have
          you helped?
                     BRUCE
          Okay, so maybe I've righted a
          couple of the wrongs in my own
          life. I was going to get around to
          others. I can do both. I can help
          the world.
                    GOD
          The world? That wasn't the world,
          Bruce. That was just Buffalo,
          between Commonwealth and 57th.
          Didn't want to start you out with
          more than you can handle. Now how
          you doing otherwise? Personal life
          in good shape?
                    BRUCE
          Yeah. Everything is great.
A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees
Bruce.
                     GRACE
          Bruce? What are you doing out
          here?
With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where
Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.

                                               77,



                     BRUCE
          Oh, ah,
               (to God)
          She can't...
               (God shakes his head, back
                to Grace)
          I just, ah, needed a little fresh

Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.
                    GRACE
          Bruce, what is going on? The
          second I want to talk about us you
          run out on me.
                     GOD
               (to Bruce)
          Everything's great, huh?
                    BRUCE
          I wasn't running out on you...
                    GRACE
          You know, I actually had the crazy
          idea that you were going to ask me
          to marry you tonight.
                    GOD
          Now it's heating up.
                     BRUCE
               (to God)
          You are not helping.
              (back to Grace)
          ...me at all here, Grace.
                     GOD
               (sarcastic)
          Nice recovery.
Bruce looks to God to shut up.
                    GRACE
          Not helping you what?
                    BRUCE
              (to Grace)
          Look hun, I want to talk about
          this. This just isn't a good time.
          Okay?

                                                               78.


                    GRACE
          When is it a good time? It's never
          a good time.
                        GOD
              She's got a point.
                        BRUCE
                  (to God)
              Stay out of this.
Grace looks at him like he's nuts.

          Who are you talking to?!
Just then, the WHISPERS start in again.        Bruce reacts.
                        BRUCE
              Oh, not now.
Bruce puts his hands to his ears.       Grace takes this as him
not wanting to listen to her.
                        GOD
          You're going to have to answer
          those things, y'know.

          running out of it.                                         *
Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands
completely frustrated.
                     BRUCE
              (to God)
          Thank you.
                     GOD
          You want some friendly advice?
                        BRUCE
          No.
God smiles.

                                                            85.



EXT. BUFFALO CITY STREETS - DAY
Bruce walks along head high, FULL OF HIMSELF. He audibly
hears snippets of prayers, snapping off responses.
                    VARIOUS PEDESTRIANS
          I've got to find a better
          job...Come on light, turn...God, I
          wish I were thinner...
                      BRUCE
          Promotion with 15% raise...It's
          green. . . Donuts are now healthy...
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY
Bruce sits at the computer, looks at the total prayer
requests, his jaw drops. 3 MILLION and growing.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, come on. What a bunch of
          whiners. This is going to suck up
          my whole life.
Bruce gets an idea, pulls down a menu on the computer,
highlights "ANSWER ALL" types in the word "YES" and hits
enter.
The computer takes over, ANSWERING EACH EMAIL AUTOMATICALLY.
Bruce smiles and gets up.
CLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER SCREEN

We see the list scroll by, everything from "LOST CAT" to
"MORE MONEY" "MAKE ME SMARTER" "MAKE ME THINNER," ETC.
"YES" "SEND", "YES" "SEND" and on and on.

ON JACK
Very uncomfortable, struggles for the right words as he's
firing somebody.
                     JACK
          Look this isn't easy for me. We're
          starting to get some complaints
          and... Well, Bobby, things just
          aren't working out.

                                                       86.


JACK'S POV
Bobby's demon-looking head, slowly ROTATES 360 DEGREES ON HIS
NECK.
                     JACK
               (scared)
          An, you can keep the cart if you
          like.
We can SEE BOBBY'S BREATH NOW.
                     BOBBY
               (deep demonic voice)
          Thanks. I've grown kind of
          attached to it.
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY
Bruce pulls up, Grace, her BODY BACK TO NORMAL, walks up and
hops in, happy.
                    GRACE
          L ook! I'm back to no rmal. It was
          the wildest thing, I was worried,
          so I said a prayer and the next
          thing I know, I was completely
          healed. It was like a miracle.
                    BRUCE
              (fakes happy)
          That's great.
                    GRACE
          So, you're taking me to lunch?
          Th is i s ra re --
               (catches herself)
          But wonderful.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, I've got something better than
          lunch.
Bruce pulls out. They drive off.
                    GRACE (O.S.)
          Oh, you'll never believe it.
          Debbie won the lotteryI
                    BRUCE (O.S.)
          Really?

                                                        87.



                      GRACE (O.S.)
           But get this, there were like 433
           thousand other winners, so it only
           paid out 17 dollars. Can you
           believe the odds of that?
EXT., UPSCALE HOME - DAY

Bruce leads her out of the car.
                      BRUCE
           Keep 'em closed...
                     GRACE
               (laughing)
          What is this?

Bruce leads Grace through the gates.                              *
                     BRUCE
          Okay...open your eyes.
Grace does and sees A STAGGERING MANSION.                         *
                     GRACE                                        *
          Wow. This is a bit overwhelming.                        *
                      BRUCE                                       *
          I know, it's incredible. Come on                        *

          No. Guess again?                                        *
Grace turns to Bruce confused.
                     BRUCE
          It's mine...ours.

                                                88.



                       GRACE
          What?
                    BRUCE
              (beaming)
          This is our new home.    Come on...
Bruce pulls Grace up the stairs.
                    GRACE
          This had to cost-- I can't even
          imagine how much this had to cost.
                    BRUCE
          7 million. That was the asking,
          but I got a deal.
                     GRACE
          Wh-What am I missing here? You
          can't afford this. You're a
          reporter. Buying cars is one
          t hing, but this--
Bruce grabs a hold of Grace.
                    BRUCE
          We'll have the money. Listen to me
          closely. I'm getting anchor.
          Then, I'm going to get spotted,
          offers will come flooding in to go
          national, and then you and I are
          moving to New York City to a place
          that will put this to shame. This
          has been my exact dream my whole
          life and it's finally going to
          happen. Every step just how I
          pictured it.

Grace just stares at Bruce.
                    GRACE
          There's only one problem.
                       BRUCE
          What?
                       GRACE
          I hate it.
Bruce is surprised.

                                          89.



          GRACE
What were you thinking? Why didn't              *
you talk to me about this?                      *
          BRUCE                                 *
I wanted to surprise you.                       *
          GRACE                                 *
Mission accomplished.                           *
          BRUCE
Honestly, I thought you'd be a
little more appreciative.
          GRACE
Appreciative of what? The fact
that you didn't include me on a
major life decision or that we now
live in the Sultan of Bernai's                  *
house?                                          *
            BRUCE
     (under his breath)
Like pearls to swine.
          GRACE
What is that supposed to mean?
          BRUCE
Let those with ears hear.
          GRACE
What is happening to you? You're
changing.

            BRUCE
Exa ct ly. F or th e bet te r. I' m not
poor and s truggling . And mayb e
that threatens you. I'm telling
you, there are plenty of women who
would love this place.
            GRACE
Yeah, and so would their pimps.                 *
           BRUCE                                *
I can't believe this. I did all                 *
this for us.                                    *
            GRACE                               *
Us ? W hat us? Yo u a lwa ys said wh en         *
your career takes off we'd get                  *

                                                          90.



                     BRUCE
           I want that.
                    GRACE                                       *
           'That'. You can't even say the                       *
          word.                                                 *
                     BRUCE                                      *
          Marriage, I want marriage, okay.                      *
          It's just not a great time right
          now.
                     GRACE
          Not a great time. What is that,
          your mantra? This is never going
          to change. . .
Grace heads down the stairs.                                    *
                    BRUCE
          Come on Grace, lighten up.                            .*
          Tomorrow's Saturday. The office is                    *
          throwing me a party here, for
          getting anchor. Let's enjoy the
          ride for a whi le. We're just
          starting to have some fun.
                      GRACE
           No, you're just starting to have
           fun.
Suddenly, the TOILET FLUSHES off camera. Grace sees Sam in
the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits.
                      GRACE
           And what in God's name is going on
           with that dogI?
Grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for the
door.
                     GRACE
          I'm going to have Debbie pick me
          up.
                     BRUCE
          Grace.
                     GRACE
          I'm sorry, but    I won't be attending
          your little pa   rty tomorrow. And if                 *
          you would like    to see me after I
          will be at our   home.                                *

                                                           91.


She starts out.
                      GRACE (CONT'D)
           Oh, and that poor, struggling guy
           you talked about? I miss him.

PARTY MUSIC UP:
INT. UPSCALE HOME - NIGHT
The PARTY OF PARTIES is in order. The place is jam packed
with co-workers, fellow reporters, and various news contacts
Everyone is in an ecstatic mood, many prayers having been
recently answered. We MOVE THROUGH THE PARTY and hear
snippets of various conversations.
                     BUSINESSMAN
           I'll drink to that! My tech stocks

Sam walks away, his tail between his legs.
Bruce maneuvers down the hall dancing, high-fiving, drunkenly *
accepting the praise coming at him from all sides.              *

          Hey Bruce, who do you like in the
          game tonight?
                     BRUCE
          Put your money on the Sabers.
          Coach prays a lot.
A FRENCH WAITER approaches Bruce.

                     FRENCH WAITER
          Ah, Mr. Nolan, we're running out of
          hors doerves. I'm afraid we under-
          ordered, sir. And the people are
          hungry.
                     BRUCE
          What do you have left?
The Waiter holds up a small basket.
                     FRENCH WAITER
          Only three chips and two shrimp.
                     BRUCE
               (confident)
          Just take it around.
The Waiter gets a confused look.
                                            CUT TO:
CHIPS OVERFLOWING, SHRIMP SPILLING OUT OF BASKETS, HANDS
REACHING GLUTTONOUSLY FOR THE BOUNTY.

The Waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips
are pulled from the small basket.
Partiers crowd around Bruce, start to chant.

                                                          93.



                      CROWD
          Speech!   Speech!!   Speech!

Bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd.
                      BRUCE
          I ' d thank you all for coming, but
          the liquor is free so maybe you
          should THANK ME!
Everyone laughs.

                     BRUCE
          And now let me tell you a story.
          There was a man who had two sons.
          The younger son took his
          inheritance and squandered his
          money on a life of lust and
          debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!

Everyone throws their hands up and continues to party.

Bruce's big smile fades. He looks around the room, hoping to
spot Grace. He grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony,
di al s --

He gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message
together from happier times. He hangs up.

                       FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey there.

Bruce turns, sees SUSAN ORTEGA, completely stunning in a sexy
dress.
                     SUSAN
          Hi Br uce. What are you d oing out
          here all alone?
                     BRUCE
          Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.

                       SUSAN
          Yeah, I didn't see her in there. I
          love the new place, by the way. So
          how are you and Grace doing?
                     BRUCE
          I don't know, we had a fight
          earlier. Ever since I . . Well,
          things are different now and...

                                                           94.



                     SUSAN
          You're on fire Bruce. Some women
          can't handle fire. Some can.
Susan smooths close to Bruce.
                     SUSAN
          You know, I always had an instinct
          about you. I knew you were going
          to make something of yourself.
                     BRUCE
          Really?
                     SUSAN
          There's something special about you
          Bruce. I like special...
                    BRUCE
          Look Susan, I don't know, I--
Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately. Bruce doesn't
join in, but doesn't fight it either.
ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR

Grace and Debbie enter.

                     DEBBIE
          So this is your new place, huh?
                     GRACE
          Cozy, don't you think? Come on

They head into the room.

          I don't want to spoil it. I know                  .    *

          So much for lashing back...
Grace stops dead in her tracks. Her face drops.
GRACE'S POV - BRUCE, still lip-locked with Susan Ortega.

                                                       95.



                     DEBBIE
          Oh, boy.

Bruce turns and sees Grace.
                     BRUCE
          Grace, I...
                     GRACE
             . (fighting back tears)
          Get the car, Deb.
                     DEBBIE
          Right.

                    BRUCE
          Grace, wait.
Grace follows Debbie out.
EXT. UPSCALE HOME - NIGHT
Bruce follows Grace outside.
                    BRUCE
          Grace, come on.
Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car
in Bruce's chest.
                     GRACE
          Here. I do n't w ant your car. I
          don't want your things. . . I don't
          want you.
                     BRUCE
          Come on, don't say that. I was
          just calling y ou--
                     GRACE
          And you thought Susan's mouth was
          the phone?
                    BRUCE
         I didn't think you were coming-- I
         mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay.
         Let me make it up to you.
                    GRACE
          How about a boat, Bruce?

                    BRUCE
          If that's what you want.

                                                        96.



                     GRACE
          Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two
          bags of cash, you know, the ones
          with the big cartoon dollar signs
          on the front. Then I'll be happy.
          Because I'm just hollow inside.
          Debbie's been right. All this
          time. I defended you, told her
          there was good in you. Another
          side to you. Well, I just saw that
          other side and I don't want
          anything to do with it.
Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car. Bruce follows,
                     BRUCE
          Grace, come on, don't do this.
                     GRACE
          Go back to your little co-anchor.
          Or is that ho-anchor?
               (tearing)
          I came back here to apologize. How
          stupid am I?
Grace turns and heads to the car.
                     BRUCE
          You're the one that didn't like the
          new place!
Grace gets in, slams the door.
                    BRUCE
          You can't walk out on me! I'm the
          alpha, lady! I'm the Omega!
Debbie peels out.
                     BRUCE
               (desperate last attempt)
          I could make you stay!
Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.
                    BRUCE
          Fine! I don't need you! I have
          everything I need. Did you hear
          that?!
               (yelling)
          I have EVERYTHING!

                                                      97.


INT. UPSCALE HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce walks in, Susan is waiting for him.
                     SUSAN
           I was right. She couldn't handle
           the fire.
                                                             *
Bruce looks at Susan with disgust, then glances to a FIRE
ALARM on the wall, mentally TRIGGERS IT. The sprinklers turn
on, as well. People scream, rush toward the exit.
Bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the
sprinklers, alone. He finally plops back and God is sitting
next to him.
                     GOD
          Enjoying your party? Yeah, nothing
          like spending time with some real
          frien ds. Any s hrimp left ?
                     BRUCE
           Grace left me.
                     GOD
           I know.
                     BRUCE
               (certain)
          She'll take me back.
               (uncertain)
          Will she take me back?
                     GOD
          Would you take you back?
Bruce mulls this over,- then...
                     BRUCE
          How do you make someone love you
          when you can't effect free will?
                     GOD
          Welcome to my world, son. You come
          up with an answer to that one, you
          let me know.
Off of Bruce thinking...
                                            CUT TO:

                                                          98.



INT. DEBBIE AND MIKE'S HOUSE - MORNING
Grace's alarm goes off. The radio comes on and it plays a
John Cougar Mellencamp song. But the lyrics are different.
                     JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP
           Here's a little ditty,
           about Grace and her man Bruce,
           two Americans growing up,
           needing to make a truce.
Grace's eyes pop open.    Is she dreaming?
EXT. DEBBIE'S HOUSE
Bruce hides behind a hedge, watches Grace jog past.
ON GRACE
notices something    CARVED IN THE TREE it reads: "GRACE +
BRUCE". Carved in     the next tree, "A COUPLE FOR THE AGES".
Carved in the next    tree, "COME ON ALREADY, GIVE HIM ANOTHER
CHANCE". She does     a double take, continues on.
INT. COFFEE SHOP

Grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch
of PICTURES FALL OUT. They are all of Bruce and Grace. She
thinks, definitely didn't -put them there.
INT. SMALL WONDER'S DAY CARE - DAY

Grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something
outside the window. It's a cloud formation that strangely
looks like BRUCE (in profile) HOLDING HANDS WITH GRACE. She
reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint "FORGIVE
HIM."
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - LATER

Grace is talking with one of the other teachers. The kids,
playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder
and louder. Grace turns and sees...
Bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.
                      BRUCE
           Okay, surrender, surrender.
He walks over to Grace.
                      BRUCE
           Hi.

                                                         99.



                       GRACE
          Hi..
                    BRUCE
          I, ah, have my first anchor
          tonight.
                    GRACE
          That's great. I hope it goes well
          for you.
He's hit in the head by a ball.    Grace can't help but smiles
Bruce leaps at the opportunity.
                    BRUCE
          I miss you.
              (off her silence)
          I just took the first step, shot
          myself out on the ledge, awaiting
          vulnerably your response.
                      GRACE
          . . . I don't know what to say.
                    BRUCE
          How about you love me and you'll
          take me back.
                       GRACE
          No, Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          Come on, what about all the signs?
                    GRACE
          What? How do you know about that?
          Did you talk to Debbie?
                      BRUCE
               (beat)
          Would it help if I told you I acted
          like an ass?
Martin is standing nearby.
                    MARTIN
          Hey, you said ass.
                    BRUCE
          It's okay as long as you mean a
          donkey. I didn't add "hole." It's
          only bad when you say "ass-ho--

                                                        100.


                      GRACE
           Alright, inside, Martin.
                (to the others)
           Okay everyone, inside.
The kids race in. Grace starts to follow.
                     BRUCE
           Grace, please. None of this seems                    *
           right without you.                                   *
               (off her reaction)                               *
           Is that a glimmer of hope I see?                     *
                     GRACE
           I have to go...                                      *
She starts off. . .
                      BRUCE
           Wait.
Bruce DRAMATICALLY RAISES A HAND TOWARD GRACE, like putting a
love spell on her.
                     BRUCE
           Now how do you feel?
She looks at him, oddly.
                      GRACE
           ...Are you out of your mind? Have
           you been drinking?
                       BRUCE
           Drin kin g? Sur e. I'm dru nk wit h
           POWER.
Bruce RAISES BOTH HANDS IN FULL HEXING FASHION...
                     BRUCE
           ...LOVE ME1!!
                      GRACE
                (a beat)
           You need help.
She heads back inside. Bruce throws his hands in the air,
frustrated.
EXT. SMALL WONDER'S PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in PRISON SUITS
(from the prison yard) drive off with it.

                                                         101.


                     BRUCE

INT. BRUCE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
The PRISONERS drive off laughing.
                    PRISONER #1
          Ha, nice wheels, huh?
BRUCE sits up in the back seat.
                    BRUCE
          Thou shalt not steal.
The prisoners JUMP.
                    BRUCE
          Car, show them the way out.
Instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways
dumping the prisoners.
                     BRUCE
          What is wrong with the world?

          The world's gone mad.
Jack clicks off the monitor. Bruce hustles in from make-up.
An air of forced confidence about him. Nothing and no one is
going to ruin his big moment.
                     JACK
          Oh, there you are. Your big debut.
          How you feeling?

          again. Exact score, dead on.
          Twenty-three to one, who would have

together. A beat of silence...

 STAGE MANAGER           The whole booth is down.
CRASH! A BRICK flies through a front window.       Bruce turns to
see...
EXT. DOWNTOWN - NIGHT 
A FULL ON RIOT in progress. College students, city dwellers
going crazy. Cars are burning, people are out of control.
Escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting
right alongside ordinary citizens.
The Kowolski brothers and Momma Kowolski are helpless against
the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying
cakes, pies, bread - whatever they can get their hands on.
Bruce stumbles through the mayhem, confused.
 BRUCE           What's going on?
 COLLEGE KIDS           Partying, man. Wooooll!!     Sabers I!
They continue to trash the area.
 BRUCE           But your team wonl
Cars are being rolled over. A lone POLICE OFFICER protects
himself with his shield as he's pelted with various debris.
The Officer PULLS BRUCE down behind a car.
 POLICE OFFICE           Stay down.

 BRUCE           Where are the other officers?

 POLICE OFFICE           What other    officers? Half the

          "ship came    in." You better get

a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker
on it.

BACK TO SCENE 
Bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming "Mr.
Exclusive" billboard above - it comes CRASHING DOWN. Bruce
looks out over the rioters.
ON BRUCE 
We see the anger build in his face, like Moses looking down
on the Israelites. He RAISES HIS ARMS. DARK CLOUDS SWIRL IN
THE SKY. WIND BLOWS. LIGHTENING CRACKS. 
 BRUCE            Hear, O' Buffalo, you have awakened
           my wrath. Vengeance is mine!
A BOLT OF LIGHTENING shoots right into the middle of the
rioters, scattering them. People flee in every direction as
THUNDER CRASHES and lightning bolts continue to strike.
Bruce stands alone in the street, surveys the smoldering
mayhem, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key
God gave him. He grips it tightly and...
INT. OMNI PRESENTS - NIGHT * 
Bruce stands there, sees God as he originally found him,
mopping. God looks up at Bruce, not surprised to see him.
 BRUCE            They're all out of control. I
           don't know what to do.
 GOD            You mind giving me a hand with this
           floor first?
Off Bruce's look. . .
 DISSOLVE TO: LATER Bruce's sleeves rolled up, mopping next to God.
 GOD *            "Poor man wanna be rich, rich man                     *
           wanna be king, king's disatisfied                     *
           'cause he rules everything..."                        *

                    GOD (cont'd)
              (to Bruce)                                        *
          Springsteen. I like a little Boss                     *
          in my head while I'm workin'...                       *
They finish up.   God looks back at the sparkling floor,
satisfied.
 GOD           There we go. Wonderful thing. No
          matter how filthy something gets,
          it can always be cleaned right up.
God collects Bruce's mop.
 BRUCE           What happened? I gave everyone
          what they wanted.
God sets the mops down.
 GOD           Since when does anyone have a clue
          about what they want?
God holds up a REMOTE AND CLICKS, changing the room into the
DINER where Bruce first parted his soup. (NOTE: Whenever the
room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a
full projection of an environment on the walls and columns)
The older waitress, Ginnie, clears some dishes...
 GOD           Remember Ginnie?
Ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back
up she is a hot 21 YEAR OLD.
 GOD           Ginnie thought she lost her beauty
          when she got older. I'm trying to
          convince her otherwise.
Ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is
HER OLDER SELF again.
God clicks the remote, changing the environment into a SCHOOL
YARD. We see the grade school where Filbert Davis, the boy
Bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.
 GOD           Ah yes, Filbert. Brilliant young
          man. He was going to be a great
          poet.
 (MORE) 108. 
                     GOD (cont'd)
          The soul of his work would have
          been built out of his hardships.
          He would have touched millions.
               (feigns cheery)
          But now he's headed for a career as
          a professional wrestler.
God clicks, changing the environment into a CONDO. We see a
lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting
depressed, rocking in a chair.
 GOD           Ester Maha. I love Ester. Ester
          was bankrupt. She was going to
          have to eat her pride and call her
          sister. Would've got the two of
          them together again. Instead, she
          bought a condo in Florida.
 * God clicks the remote again...
 GOD * *                (recalling Bruce's own
                words)                                          *
          And have you seen the news lately?                    *

                  Bruce's words)                                   *

 BRUCE *           So what do I do?                                         *
God smiles, asks him again what he asked him in the alley...   *
 GOD *           You want some advice?                                    *
 BRUCE *           Yes.                                                     *
God smiles, starts to walk away...                                 *
 GOD *           Everybody wants a miracle, Bruce.                        *

          But what they don't understand is,
          they're the one's holding the
          power.
God claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the
latter.
 BRUCE           Wait. Where are you going?
 GOD           This is good-bye, Bruce. You've
          learned a lot. I think you should
          be able to handle things now.
God climbs, ascending into the light.
 BRUCE           What if I have a question? What if
          I need you?
God stops, looks down to Bruce.
 110. 

 GOD           See Bruce, that's your problem.
          That's everybody's problem. You
          keep looking up. . .
He smiles and disappears into the light, leaves Bruce
thinking.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY Bruce stands in the apartment, Sam at his side. No signs of
Grace. The bed is made. Empty.
Then, he notices the BOX OF PHOTOS, the incomplete albums.
He picks up a photo of he and Grace in an even tinier
apartment, Sam is a puppy, they have little money, and
despite it all look very happy. Bruce smiles at the memory.
Reaches for a stack of photos...
EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING Bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic. A man's car is
broken down in the middle of the street causing the
bottleneck.
Bruce sees THE SIGN GUY by the side of the road.   His sign
reads: ALL FOR WON.
Bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at
the frustrated man.
CUT TO - the stalled car is now rolling to the shoulder and
we REVEAL that Bruce is doing the pushing.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT THE COMPUTER The auto-function is answering "YES" to the prayer emails.
Bruce clicks cancel, turns off the computer.
INT. SCHOOL YARD Filbert Davis is beating up another kid. Bruce watches at a.
distance.
 BRUCE           Bruce giveth and Bruce taketh away.
Suddenly, Filbert goes to throw a punch but his punch has no
sting. The bigger boy looks down and grins.
CLOSE ON FILBERT - SUDDEN FEAR IN HIS EYES 11 1. 
INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM The teacher stands before the class, reading a student's
paper.
 TEACHER           "Pain". By Filbert Davis.
As she reads the poem, PAN TO Filbert Davis seated in class
with a ripe BLACK EYE.
EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING Bruce is waiting for Sam to pee.

 BRUCE           Come on, Sam. Let's do this the
          right way... Oh, alright...
Bruce pulls out a SWATCH OF CARPET, lays it on the grass.
Sam happily goes. They walk off together.
 BRUCE           That's not normal you know.
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY Bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the
counter - all number 6.
 BOBBY               (demonic voice)
          Do you have these in red?
Bruce walks up behind Bobby.
 BRUCE           Okay Bobby, it's time to come back.
Bobby HISSES at Bruce, turns INSANELY DEMONIC.

 BOBBY LEAVE ME HOLY MAN OR I WILL FEED ON           YOUR SOUL!It

 BRUCE                (casual)
          Un-damn you, Bobby.
Bobby instantly transforms to normal.
 112. 

 BOBBY           Hey thanks, Bruce.
               (holds out a cookie)
          Biscotti?
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY Evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much
worse for the wear. Bruce walks up to him.
 EVAN           You're probably here to gloat over
          the anchor position. Go ahead, I'm
          sure I deserve it.
 BRUCE           You know, Evan.    I've been a real
          prick.
Evan stops, looks up at Bruce, confused.
 BRUCE           You were born to anchor. I'm not
          taking the position. Oh, and I
          never really congratulated you on
          getting the job in the first place.
          Congratulations, Evan.
Bruce offers his hand, Evan takes it. When their hands meet,
there is a kind of ELECTRICAL CHARGE that passes between
them. Bruce walks off, Evan is confused when he catches his
reflection in the mirror. HE'S BACK TO NORMAL!
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - LATER ON TV 
Evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it.
Jack is relieved.
 EVAN BAXTER           In the financial world, things are
          settling back to normal in what
          analysts are calling a fluke market
          fluctuation...
Bruce enters.
 BRUCE           You made the right choice, Jack.
 113. 


 JACK                 So what about you? What will you
                do?
 BRUCE                 With your permission, I think I'll
                go out there and make the people
                laugh. To quote a friend, "God
                knows we could use it."
Jack smiles.
 JACK                 Permission granted.
Bruce turns to go, then turns back.
 BRUCE                 Oh, are you hungry? I know a place
                that makes a mean tomato soup.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT Bruce walks along side Jack. Jack talks and talks, happy to
have the company. Bruce opens a door for Jack, leading to..
INT. DINER Bruce and Jack take a seat at the counter.
 WAITRESS (O.S.)                 Coffee, gentlemen?
Jack and the waitress lock eyes - there's an instant
attraction. Bruce smiles.
 BRUCE                 Jack. This is a friend of mine,
                Cindy. Cindy this is Jack.
 JACK CINDY       (sm itte n)                           (smit ten)
Hi.                                   Hi.
EXT. EYEWITNESS NEWS STATION - DAY ON THE HOMELESS SIGN GUY His sign reads:
"GOD BEE GOOD HONEY" 114. 

PULL BACK to reveal BRUCE, sitting next to him with his own
sign reading:
"WHATEVER fl£ SAID"

With a little arrow pointing to the Homeless Sign Guy.
EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
Bruce paces, waiting for Sam.
 BRUCE           You can do it, Sam. Without the
          carpet. Come on.
Sam does. Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is
surprised to see Debbie standing there.
 DEBBIE                (re: the peeing dog)
          Looks like your rain dance worked.
 BRUCE           Debbie. Hey. You know, I never
          got to apologize for--
 DEBBIE           I didn't really come to chat, I
          came for Grace's things.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT 
Debbie is packing items into a box. She sees the photo
albums on the coffee table. She flips through, surprised.
 DEBBIE           They're full... You did all this?
Bruce nods. Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up.
 DEBBIE           You really hurt her, you know.
 BRUCE           I know.
Debbie starts to go, but turns back.
 DEBBIE           You know what I do before I go to
          sleep every night? I tuck my kids
          in bed, I eat a scoop of ice cream
          and watch Conan.
 (MORE) 115. 
                     DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You know what Grace does? She
          prays. Most of the time for you.
This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE' S APARTMENT - NIGHT Bruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e--
mails and types in GRACE CONNELLY. He hits "search". 1,273
entries appear.
 BRUCE           The woman does pray a lot.
He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits. There are
335 matches. He checks a few...
     "Dear God, please help Bruce to find himself, find
     contentment, find You."
     "Dear God, please help Bruce. He's struggling to find
     meaning."
     "Dear God, help Bruce to be happy. He can't seem to
     find his way..."
Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every
morning and night for months on end.
Bruce is touched.
 BRUCE           She still loves me, Buddy.
He KISSES SAM and races out.
EXT. DEBBIE HOUSE - NIGHT Bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another
special creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets
them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.
Better.
He heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He
looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.
He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.
GRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her
cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.
 GRACE           Please God. Please...
 11 6. 


Through her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with
total love.
 GRACE              Please God. I still love him...
Bruce smiles, thankful.
 GRACE              ...but I don't want to love him
             anymore. Please God. Help me to
             forget.
                  (cries)
             I don't want to hurt anymore. I
             want to forget.
Bruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a
hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly
selfless act. He lets Grace go.
ON GRACE Her face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.
A sad smile.
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Rain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at
God. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up
heavenward, weakly. Humble.
 BRUCE              You win. I' m done. Please. I
             don't want to do this anymore. I
             don't want to be God.
                  (sighs)
             Please, help me.
And with that, the rain stops. The dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce,
birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .
HONK1 HONKI 
A MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME, MOWS BRUCE DOWN. His spirit
remains in the same spot, looking confused, then STREAKS UP
heavenward.
FLYING POV 117. 


SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile, THROUGH THE CLOUDS,
THROUGH THE SKY to...

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls, just white as far as the eye
can see. The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.
Bruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when
he turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as
though sitting in the most royal throne.
 BRUCE           Am I...?
 GOD           You can't expect to kneel down in
          the middle of a highway and live to
          talk about it.
 BRUCE           But why? Why now?
 GOD           I work in mysterious ways, son.
A beat as Bruce takes everything in.
 BRUCE           You knew it all along. You knew if
          I got everything I wanted, I would
          ruin my life.
God doesn't respond, just listens.
 BRUCE           So I'm dead... Okay. If this is
          what you want. Okay, okay...
God holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce. Bruce
looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled.
 GOD           Go ahead, use 'em.
 BRUCE           Alright... I've learned that I
          don't know as much I thought I
          did...
 GOD           Boy, you can say that again.
 BRUCE           Hey, I'm praying here.
 118. 

 GOD           Sorry, go.
 BRUCE           If I could have just one thing in
          the world. It would be for Grace
          to live a happy, joyful life. And
          that she finds someone...
              (getting emotional as he
               realizes what he's
               saying)
          ...that she finds someone that will
          treat her with the love and respect
          that she so deserves.
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles.
 GOD           Now that is a prayer.
               (beat)
          Well, I better get on that one.
          See ya, Bruce.
Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --
FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH, back THROUGH THE
CLOUDS, and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where...
BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH.    The PRAYER BEADS
still clutched tightly in his hand.
TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR, see that his vitals have
returned. . .
 NURSE           He's back!
 INTERN           BP 40 over 110 and rising.
 DOCTOR #1                (to Bruce) -
          Bruce? Can you hear me?
               (Bruce nods)
          We almost lost you there.
WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged.
 DOCTOR #1           You lost a lot of blood. It wasn't
          easy to find a match - you're a
          very rare blood type.
 119. 


Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "A/B Positive" written on
the side.
CLOSE ON BRUCE - THINKING, HIS MIND RACING 
 BRUCE                (groggy whisper)
          A/B Positive...
 DOCTOR #2 (O.S.)           You should thank God for donors.
          We don't have a lot of that type on
          hand.
 NURSE           There's your angel now.
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...
GRACE 
A cotton swab taped to her arm. Now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type.
 GRACE                (re: her swab)
          I hear that all of this winds up in
          a warehouse somewhere. But you
          know me, I'm a sucker for this
          stuff.
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving
the two of them alone. Grace tentatively approaches.
 GRACE           I don't even know what I'm doing
          here. But... When I heard that
          you'd been in an accident and that
          you might not make it. . .
She starts to cry.
 BRUCE           Hey, I'm okay.
 GRACE           Does it hurt?
 BRUCE           Only when I talk., and smile... and
          y'know, exist in general.
 120. 


Grace laughs. That's one thing Bruce could always do, is
make her laugh. Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's
hand, raises his arm.
 GRACE           Oh my gosh, you still have those?
Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace. He
remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him
 GRACE           What is it?
 BRUCE           Nothing. It's just really nice to
          see you.
She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.
 DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CITY PARK - DAY A BIG BLOOD DRIVE in progre   ss. Everyone is there, Grace,
Sam, Debbie and Zoe, Ginnie   and Jack, the Kowolski brothers,
Momma Kowolski, Evan, Susan   , Dallas, Fred. Bobby serves
various food items from his   cart.
 BOBBY           You know, French Toast was invented
          by tavern owner, Joseph French, who
          had a poor knowledge of grammar,
          and did not know how to use the
          possessive apostrophe, so he called
          it French Toast instead of French's
          Toast...
Pull back to reveal BRUCE, crutch under one arm, cast on his
leg, mic in hand, reporting. He's now talking in his OWN
VOICE, much more himself.
 BRUCE           This is Bruce Nolan at Buffalo's
          first annual "Be the Miracle" blood
          drive. Remember, the life you save
          may be mine, so hurry down. I had
          a close call and, well, can you
          imagine what life would have been
          like without me?
Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.
Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.

 BRUCE           In honor of this event, the
          Kowolski brothers have baked a one-
          of-a-kind, creation.
The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see
that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.
 BRUCE           Sure, a little creepy and a
          shameless plug, but we love 'em.
              (Bruce breaks off a little
               piece, takes a bite)
          Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's
          Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that
          gets more air time than a high
          speed chase.
Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.
Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties
off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.
 · BRUCE           To be honest, I've never been a big
          fan of shots. . .
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is
starting to sweat.
 BRUCE               (nervous)
          Okay, we're good to go...They just
          stick it into my arm. Breaking
          through the skin, of course...
The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.
Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:
 BRUCE BLLLAAAA! 
Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.
They all laugh.

 BRUCE           Had you going, didn't IIIIII1

He reacts to the nurse POKING the needle in. Everyone laughs
more.

 BRUCE            No, this is nothing. In fact, this
           is the second time I've given blood
           this week. For those of you who
           haven't heard, I ' d like you to meet
           the soon to be Mrs. Exclusive.
He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return.    The crowd
applauds.
 BRUCE            This is Bruce Nolan reporting for
           Eyewitness News.
The camera cuts.   Bruce lowers his mic, turns to Grace.
 BRUCE            So, what'd you think?
 GRACE *            I don't know, I thought it was very                   *
           pleasurable.                                          *
Bruce smiles, they kiss...
As the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd,
heading somewhere. Bodies clear frame and we see the
HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads:
THEE END The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and
in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly
transforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and
w. . .
